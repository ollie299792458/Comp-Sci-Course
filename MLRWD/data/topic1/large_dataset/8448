Yes, could have been better with better, faster pacing!
BIG MAN JAPAN is a satire of Japanese monster movies and Superhero shows, and had they gone with a faster pace and more depth in the story, could've been great.
Movie is done in sort of an "interview", documentary style, and that wasn't a bad idea, its just that they spend too much time talking and the action is rather limited, and when it does occur, it is rather short in duration.
Story involves the human alter-ego of a giant Sumo-like superhero and his "adventures". Seems he is the 6th in line of a group of similar heroes, but he himself is very unpopular and widely disliked because of his clumsiness during his battles with the monsters.
Said"monsters" are outrageously designed critters that all have human faces except for one with a giant eye. The effects ARE pretty good, and the hero and the monsters really do look as big as they are supposed to be, but the action sequences are not very exciting, nor do they last long.
There are a few genuinely funny moments, but they are few. You must be familiar with Japanese superhero shows like "Ultraman" to have any idea what is going on here. Worst of all, the ending!!All I can say is ....WTF!!!! Has nothing to do with the pace of the story and only serves to show this is a parody of "Ultraman', and not a good one at that!
The basic problem is that the movie is too slow-paced, it it mostly talk with the hero and the off camera interviewer, and when the action occurs it just isn't enough to save the movie from being an utter bore. At least "Monster x Strikes Back" has better pacing than this one, and that certainly wasn't a good movie!
So Japanese monster lovers...be warned, this just isn't as good as it sounds or as good as it easily could have been!
