My complaints are mostly wrapped around the "concert Hall" index. There are 24 songs on the DVD in a variety of languages. It is great except there are no visuals associated with the songs.  The same with the alphabet and counting section. there is merely a voice reciting the alphabet and numbers in 7 different languages.  You would think that the letters and numbers would flash on the screen in different colors or something.  Needless to say, my little one doesn't pay any attention to the video. She is one who "watches" TV all the time, so we bought this to make her TV viewing more developmentally appropriate and educational. 
The home theater section is just like others have commented, a stream of sing-song like speaking.  there are visuals associated that sometimes don't match up.  It is tough to follow because the languages are all mixed up in order and there are no cues to tell you what language it is.  
The only section that I like on this video is the language lab index (a very short segment of the DVD). There are vocabulary words stated with pictures that flash on the screen.  there are separate lessons for the seven languages (this time you choose the language).  This is more developmentally appropriate, but be aware, they also sell Baby Einstein cards to go with the video. Had I known, I would have just bought the cards and did the same thing myself.  
Regarding the navigation of the DVD, it is awful.  There is a caveat in the parents guide that states it varies by DVD player.  However, the menus are compartmentalized, so there is no way to get back to a "main menu" without stopping the DVD and starting again.  Strange.  
I am not giving up on the Baby Einstein videos. I have heard great things about the Bach, Mozart, and Neptune.  I will definitely read the reviews first and possibly rent from the library next time.
