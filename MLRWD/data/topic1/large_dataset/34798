A lot of social and political commentary relevant to todays culture. A lot of gray area amongst the characters. The 2 inmates were "heroes" when they had to be. Also, the element of police "overreaction" to gang members at the beginning which led to an assault on a police precinct. It's surprising you don't hear about precinct assaults in the news. You get enough disenchanted people together, much damage can be done. Their mentality is a lot like terrorists today with the "martyr" attitude towards their cause. This flick and Stallone's "Nighthawks" unfortunately depicted what the world has become today with enough disenchanted people in this world to make each and everyone of us vulnerable whether we are in a department store or on a lonely nature trail. I refuse to see the remake that was released. This movie is classic and everyone should see once with an open mind. The "Ice Cream" scene is also reality and was considered too graphic 30 years ago. Hear about needless shootings everyday here in Buffalo, can't imagine what major cities encounter.
