This video is a good routine to change up your everyday cardio. The moves are fairly simple and the instructor goes over each individual step multiple times before combining anything. Each routine is run through multiple times at the end and also a few times from the top each time the instructor adds a new step. I only have two cons. First, there really is a learning curve. Some of the steps took just a little longer for me to pick up than the time given by the instructor. I did like the fact that she goes through the full routine each time you learn a new step because that gave me a bit more time to firm things up before we moved on to add yet another step. Second, some of the routines seemed a little one-sided. As silly as it may sound, one routine in particular seemed to concentrate on the right side of the body. Yes, this is cardio, but you are still using your muscles, which still means toning. I may be super-paranoid, but I also do not like to tire one side and not the other. My simple solution was to make my own routine going the other way. That takes a bit of coordination, but it worked. Overall, the cuing is great, the instructor is very into her routines and the video was a nice change from your traditional "boot camp" or "aerobic" workouts. Worth the less than $10 I paid just for the change. Oh, and HUGE PLUS, the abs workout was great! It's all a standing workout, but I really felt it. She uses simple moves, but I am not used to doing any standing abs so it was a great change that I felt in the morning.
