Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a must-have movie for every collection.  The Diamond Edition includes both a regular DVD as well as the blu-ray edition of the film.  This is something I greatly appreciate with four young children--the regular DVD can be used by them to watch over and over while the Blu-ray film remains pristine in our collection.

Snow White is one of my favorites of all Disney's films.  It is not only a classic movie, but one that has ingrained itself in American culture.  This particular release includes bonus features such as Disney's Family Play and Backstage Disney.  Children will enjoy the mini games while film or history buffs will love the behind-the-scenes information.

In classic fairy-tale tradition, Snow White must escape her evil step-mother--and--queen.  She runs away and encounters the seven dwarfs.  For a while, all is well--Snow White endears herself to the dwarfs and takes care of them in return for a place to stay.  The Queen discovers her hiding place and entices her to bite an apple that has been infused with an evil spell.  Snow White succumbs to the apple's poison.  All is not lost, however--the spell may be broken by true love's kiss!  When Snow White's soul mate arrives and kisses her, she awakens to live "happily ever after."  While some may object to the helpless female character passively waiting to be rescued by her prince, the movie is still an enjoyable story and this could provide an excellent opportunity to discuss such issues in a wider context.

This is one movie that needs to be in everyone's movie collection.  The entire family will enjoy watching this--it is a timeless classic that has been visually enhanced for modern viewing.
