This film goes in circles. Everytime Judd has one of her blackouts the same things happen; flashbacks and murders. Judd plays a female detective who drinks a lot, flirts and smiles a lot, all while she's becoming murder suspect number one. Judd wants to be the Kathleen Quinlan of her generation, which isn't a bad thing, but she also plays on it a lot (twinkling eyes of joy). I think she was better in "Double Jeopardy". Jackson is totally miscast and sleepwalks through his part as the police chief, whereas Garcia, the actor, just keeps getting better and better - he also looks more and more like Christopher Lee as time goes by. (-A sure contender for the title role in "The Christopher Lee Story", if they ever make it.) Though the pacing is good the film is a bit on the boring side with no real action scenes, only off-screen killings, all after-the-fact stuff. I still liked it better than other Judd thrillers of late, such as "Kiss The Girls" and "Eye Of The Beholder". Some odd elements remain unanswered though, like, why Judd's character has an elderly Asian female peeping Tom for a neighbour. Veronica ("Invasion Of The Body Snatchers") Cartwright appears unbilled as a landlady, but blink and you'll miss her. Not a bad film but unfinished somehow, and the (predictable) ending is badly executed. Best scene in fact, is an excellent photographed late night crime scene with a brightly lit stadium in the background.
