UPDATE:
Disk 2 was supposed to contain all of the special features, but there wasn't any extra content that I could find on any of the disks, so I am returning my copy for a refund.

I knew this was going to be very "autobiographical", but from how it was advertised, I expected it to be as much about the concert experience as it was the behind the scenes story.  This movie however, is a 93 minute VH1 documentary with very little actual concert footage.  Where there is concert footage, it is interrupted by interviews.  Only toward the end are there a couple of songs which were played in their entirety.  I haven't watched any of the extras, so this review is just based on the movie itself.  I'll update my review after I watch the other disks.

From what I was able to tell, most of the movie was shot in 2D with a few 3D embellishments.  The concert footage was shot in 3D and looked good, but this was hardly what I would call (or would have paid for had I known) a 3D movie.

The movie was kind of an interesting insight into Katy Perry's life, but I walked away from it liking her less.  As written in other reviews, she comes across as stiff and fake as her candy colored costumes and props.  She is supposed to be some sort of role model, but for what, I don't know.  She is a natural beauty who hides behind a phony persona, not exactly role model material.  Her music might have been from the heart at one point, but by the end of the movie, she seems to have become the formulaic act she was fighting against at the beginning.  Granted, it is her formula...or is it?  You decide.

Not worth the purchase price (especially for the 3D content) unless you're a die hard KP fan, but probably worth renting.
