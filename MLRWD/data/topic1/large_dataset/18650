I didn't buy these on DVD, but my wife and I watched them all on Netflix. They really made me think about how amazing the creatures on this planet are and how amazing our God really is. To me it takes WAY more faith to believe in evolution than it does creationism. When you step back and look at the amazing complexities and how they are all intertwined and work together harmonically you can't help but realize that there has to be a God and this all could not have just happened from some primordial soup or some big bang. It's statistically impossible. I don't care how long of time it may have supposedly taken.

For the evolutionists, where did the particles come from the big bang? Where did the first atom come from that makes up any kind of particle, and to take it a step further, to think that this whole complex eco system that we live on called Earth along with the entire order of the universe all evolved from 1 small atom molecule that suddenly decided to explode and make new atoms. You can't take absolutely nothing, no matter or particles or anything and then suddenly have something unless it was created. Believing in evolution is absurd. Our God is an awesome God.
