Independence Day is a very entertaining movie.  The special effects are excellent and Will Smith's humour is as usual, spot on.  The story-line is pretty weak, but that's okay, this is a movie designed to entertain, not make you think.  The initial build up and deployment of the alien space craft is my favourite segment of the movie.  It's the second part of the movie that things start to go wrong.  There are just too many cheesey bits which ruin the movie.  Will Smith's first encounter with the downed alien craft is a huge disappointment.  He sees an alien, punches it, then sits back and has a cigar.  Nice line "Welcome to earth", but the whole scene is a real let down.  One punch and the alien is knocked out? What about other aliens in the craft?  What about his curiosity as to what else is inside the craft, he is a pilot who wants to be an astronaut for crying out loud?  Then there are other ridiculous scenes such as the President giving his patriotic speech, which sounds like it was written to be given to a whole nation, or nations and he delivers it to a handful of people.  But the worst part of the movie for me, was when a handful of civilians (albiet Vietnam vets) end up flying F18's.  This unfortunately is just stretching things too far. At the risk of getting some negative feedback for this review, I found it pretty sycophantic when the movie panned around the world, to see military survivors from different nations listening in to the Americans.  The British soldier made the comment about relying on the Americans. This scene merely shows Americans as being full of the themselves and condescending and wasn't necessary.  Overall, I enjoyed this movie, but it misses the mark terribly for the reasons above.  The Five Star Collection version is the equivilant of my Region 4 Special Edition version.  And what a great DVD package this is.  Two CD's, full colour booklet, and a host of extra features.
