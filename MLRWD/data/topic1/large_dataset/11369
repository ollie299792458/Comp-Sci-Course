This movie is pretty terrible.  I've seen pornos that have better plots than this.  Basically Jet Li is this dude's personal one-man-army on a leash, and whenever his owner removes the leash Jet Li hands out beat downs.  Eventually Morgan Freeman's character befriends Li, and teaches Li about art and culture.  In the process Li learns to appreciate human life, and decides he doesn't want to fight anymore.  However Li is forced to either defend himself or die, as he is literally thrown into battles throughout the movie.  The storyline is corny to begin with, and the acting is subpar as well.

The fight scenes are well done though.  Some of the moves Li pulls off are amazing, but they aren't enough to save the movie. I painfully watched about 30-45 min of this movie before I gave up on it.  After that I just fast forwarded to all the fight scenes.

If you are a die hard fan of martial arts movies you might appreciate "Unleashed" more that I do.  I admit that I'm not the biggest fan of martial arts movies.  However, I am a fan of good movies in general, and "Unleashed" definitely does not belong in that category.

PS-Even though I don't like this movie, I can't deny that Jet Li is a bad a**.  I don't know of any other 120 lb dudes that could beat me up, but Jet Li would definitely kick my a**.  I think Jet Li could take on Steven Seagal, Jackie Chan, and Van Damme at the same time as well.
