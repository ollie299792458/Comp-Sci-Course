I am surprised by Casey Affleck's performance in this movie. What a great acting! He delivers the role of a young detective with amazing conviction. He is shown as a young man named Patrick living in some Boston hood with his girlfriend (who is also his partner as detective). He looks younger than his age and isn't too big physically (so people don't take him seriously at first), but has enough courage, toughness and wisdom that is required by his job. Inspite of living in an environment riddled with problems, hostility, drug abuse etc, he has maintained high moral values. And it is this morality and its ambiguity that the movie focuses on. When a little girl in the neighborhood goes missing, Patrick is asked by the girl's aunt to look for her. What follows next is a great combination of suspense, crime and drama, with quite a few clever twists in the plot. When the movie ends, you are left thinking about the fine line that sometimes separates the right and the wrong.

The direction is top-notch and so is the script, and Ben Affleck deserves the credit. When I started watching the movie, I had no idea it will be this good, especially having seen Ben Affleck in some pointless movies. But as it turns out, he is much more talented behind the camera than in front of it. Among the actors, as I mentioned earlier, Casey Affleck is a revelation. Amy Ryan, playing the little girl's irresponsible and drug addict mother, is excellent in her role. However I feel that Morgan Freeman is wasted and didn't have a lot to do in this movie. The background score is beautiful. As many people are saying, it's one of the best movies of 2007. They are right. Watch it by any means.
