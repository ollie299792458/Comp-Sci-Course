I have watched Snow White since I was a little kid and I watched it from the VHS that I used to own. I know way too much about Snow White than I want to. I kept watching it Until I was too bored to watch it and some of the Friends of Hours have the 2001 copy and I kept seeing it and when my parents rented it at Blockbuster, I was a little bit scared because I was imagining myself with the Queen Leaving and the Mirror Saying "See you soon." and the face turned into a Girls face that looked like the Magic Mirror. (Now that is what's on my mind) And After I saw it when I was a little Kid, I never watched it again and I knew how the story goes. It has been so many years since I never saw it again. I was about to Rent that On Netflix and it was taking a while to have it. When I find out that We still have our Netflix movies, It was taking forever since we have them rented and I was setting out to take care of that myself. On January 18th two days After I got In & Out, I bought that movie at Best Buy and I was trying to figure out which disc has the Dopey's Wild Mine Ride and it's on Disc 2. I went back to it and I loved it. And I found out that it's my favorite movie by Walt Disney.
