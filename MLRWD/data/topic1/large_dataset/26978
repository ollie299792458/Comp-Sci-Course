I too had looked forward to the release of this series on dvd.  I am disappointed that even though the series was shown on TV with closed captions, the dvd set does not have them.  However, I was not surprised as this is an A & E release who along with Picture This!, Acorn, Koch Vision, BBC America and Anchor Bay lead the way in releasing non-subtitled or closed captioned dvds.  I mention BBC America because it is most interesting that BBC releases in the UK are subtitled or closed -captioned but the same releases here are often not.

  Paranormal States is a superior show. Why is this and other quality shows not released with closed-captions or Subtitles.  All these companies engage in interstate commerce so why does the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) not apply to these releases which, when not subtitled or closed-caption, disenfranchise a large group of persons nation and world-wide?  Either this is deliberate flouting of the law or the law does not apply. If the former then Congress should have an investigation into this matter and if the latter than Congress should amend the law to require these producers to release all dvds with closed-captioning subtitles.  Other than sheer greed combined with inconsideration I see not reason why dvd releases should not be.
