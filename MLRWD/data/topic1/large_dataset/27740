I was really surprised at how good this film was. I was expecting the kinda so-so made for cable stuff that is watchable but not exceptional. This was a whole lot more.

Other people have written some great reviews here. I just want to underline one thing.

Tom Berringer's performance as Teddy Roosevelt was very good. At first I didnt even know it was him. Then when I knew it was him I still was like, I cant believe its Tom Berringer. He really nails the eccentric personality of Roosevelt, and he does it in a way that honors that great Presidents memory. I think this is one of the best performances of his career and when you think about who he was portraying and how great that man was, Berringer nailing it like that shows he was the right man for the job.

The whole cast does a great job, with standouts from Gary Busey, Sam Elliot, and even George Hamilton.

If you like historical films, you should like this one.

Teddy Roosevelt was one of the best Presidents we ever had. Its a shame so few people today have any clue about him.
