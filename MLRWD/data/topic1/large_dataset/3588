TO BE FAIR TO AMAZON PERHAPS IF THE FIRST SET HAD SOLD WE WOULDN'T BE DISCUSSING THIS. SOME CREDIT SHOULD BE GIVEN THEM FOR JUMPING ON THE BREAD WAGON. MY MAIN PROBLEM WAS WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS IT WAS LISTED FOR ABOUT $27.00. IN A DAY IT JUMPED TO $42.00. WITHOUT SOME ADVANCE WARNING I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO CONSIDER BUYING THIS FOR ALL THE REASONS ALREADY LISTED. MOST OF US ARE MOVIE "COLLECTORS" AND NOT JUST CASUAL BUYERS. FOR THIS PRICE I CAN'T SEE DOING IT IF IT ISN'T A FULL RELEASE. THE PRICE MIGHT WELL BE CONSIDERED TOO MUCH EVEN FOR THAT IN A THE WRITTINGS ON THE WALL FOR DVD'S WITH BLU-RAY. ANOTHER FACTOR AS IN MOST CASES THE SECOND SEASON HAD CHANGES WHICH MAKE IT A RISK TO BUY AS THE FIRST HAD A FINE BEGINNING BUT WITH CHARACTER DECISIONS AND WEAKER STORIES WHICH HURT THE SHOW AND WERE CORRECTED JUST IN TIME TO MAKE THE LAST EPISODES WORTHY. THAT CARRIED OVER INTO TGHIS SEASON. HAVING UNREMASTERED SINGLE MOVIES IS ONE THING, SETS ANOTHER ( I REALIZE THIS IS THE CASE EVEN WITH A FULL REALEASE ). THE PROBLEM IS TOO MANY GOOD MOVIES THAT WOULD SELL ( AND MANY HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ) ARE BEING MIXED WITH MOVIES THAT QUITE FRANKLY WOULDN'T SELL WELL. LOOK OVER AMAZONS LIST AND THEIR ARE A FEW GEMS THERE. AT LEAST MOST SINGLE DISC'S ARE UNDER $19.00 WHICH IS A JOKE FOR A DVD-R DISC. SO IF THIS IS TO BE A SUCCESS, THE PRICE HAS TO BE FAIR.
