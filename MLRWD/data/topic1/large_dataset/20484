When I saw this documentary it confirmed what Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States 1492 - the Present" talked about regarding the hard fought victories of early unionism in America.  I was grabbed by the throat emotionally by this documentary and its grip did not stop with the end of the film.  Union members literally get beaten, shot, disrespected, and dismissed by the mine owners and their goon squads.

What impresses me most is the courage of these miners, their wives and families.  With union membership in America down to 9% it makes me wonder where are those who will fight for a decent living wage, health care, a safe and healthy environment, and a future for their children.  These coal miners set an example for everyone who seeks a more just society.  Their solidarity is remarkable under any circumstances, but especially so where law enforcement was owned by the coal company.

The coal miners of Harlan County are the kind of activist citizens who make me proud to be an American.  I just hope a follow up documentary will be done to see what the situation is there now.
