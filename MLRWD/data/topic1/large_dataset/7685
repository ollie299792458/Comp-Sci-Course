I have seen this film and I must say that this is one of my "best" in my collection of war films.

This is a little known film, even I didn't know about it, until I passed the DVD section at Tower and saw it...
and since I have read the books...
"Bravo Two Zero","The One That's Got Away", and "The REAL Bravo Two Zero".
I picked this movie up and I was not disappointed in the least.

This film is made (IMO)in my opinion great.
I didn't see anything really wrong.
The actors were chosen perfectly.
I did note the insertion scene, and I will agree, that it was done rather "cheaply".
Not only were the actors' great in this film, but the UK lingo was great to hear and is not really hard to understand, you JUST have to pay attention.

I will not repeat what has already been said about this film.
I will also avoid getting into the "Whats real" debacal.
Each soldier in war (any war) will have a difference of opinions on what HIS versions/experiences will be.
Each soldiers experiences are always different.

But what hasn't been said (yet), which really impressed me also about the film, was particularly the soundtrack.
Ferguson did an excellent job with it.
The music is very moving...
It was great during the "running across the desert at sundown" and in "when the storm came in" scenes.
Just excellent! BRILLIANT!!
** (note) I will say that I have been in the Gulf War and I experienced that "storm" and (yes) it does get COLD! I remember it well...and true.  It happened.

So, I ask...
Where's the terrific soundtrack to a terrific movie?

I recommend this movie.
It's a worthy addition to any war lover's collection.
