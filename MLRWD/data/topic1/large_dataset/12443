If you filter the cultural aspect, and take the context of the story,
you will not underrate the movie because there are no guns drawn, no punches thrown,
well, almost no punches, but I'm not giving the movie away (1), the movie is more
than a casual introspection of a guy that came from a life of struggle,
capitalizes on hustling, where the humble kitchen table is the faithful family
silent witness,
and when mortality knocks hard at the door, injustice, racism, exploitation, greed ... is something he wants to "live" to fight against;
just like some other rich guy in some other movie (), makes sure "His" name is engraved
in some strategic hallway of your Hospital or University, -
yes, the parallels of life -, sooooo, relax, have a drink of your choice that conforts you, and watch this well acted and scripted movie for what it is;
don't forget, one day you might or will be one or the other, if, you "lahcky".
One more thing, all two cents of it, chinese men kissing on screen, nose booger poking  (not the sole reason for me describing the kitchen table, dessert?
most people (geographically and not so geographically, academically and not so academicl_y speaking) choose marinated cherries as a topping (smile),
at least the ones with a dubious open mind (smile)), economic refugees ... and their lives, a woman/mother/wife that loves her husband and children,
but is consciously willing to lose it all in the name of experiencing Self freedom (nothing so new here , the rich ones are doing it for ages, pardon my sarcasm.. honest!, better yet, watch Don Luis Bu&ntilde;uel films, yes, another spanish guy), (1);
as for me, a global village citizen of this modern times,
you didn't cross the line Mr. Alejandro I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, you made european Cinema history (!).
Congratulations Spain/Mexico.
