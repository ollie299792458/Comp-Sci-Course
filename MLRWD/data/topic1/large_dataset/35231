This is by far the best home workout I've done. I usually get bored with my dvds after a while and they wind up catching dust on my bookshelf. I went through all 8 weeks of the HHA rotation (4 weeks if you have the basic package)and I'm going to start it over again next week. When I first started, Shaun T. annoyed me a little; he talked way too much for me. But after a while, I got used to it, he has great cues so he's easy to follow, and he is funny. He definately adds something to the workout; he isn't dull and that's what makes it so fun. And he isn't too hard on the eyes. This workout does make you sweat and it is absolutely fun to do. I'm not sure if I lost anything, I didn't take my measurements before hand and I didn't change my diet. However, I do notice that I have a waistline now, I have more definition in my legs and after having a flat behind for as long as I can remember, I think I have a little bit of a tushy now. I do look good in my jeans, if I do say so myself. I still have a stomach pooch in front but this second go round I'm going to really watch my diet and hope it comes off. Very good workout. Love it!
