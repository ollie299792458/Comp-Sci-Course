Okay, just for the easily shocked: this movie is about serial killers who are good-looking, charming, and delusional. One is a fifteen-year-old girl who is infatuated with a twentysomething sociopath named Kit. From the beginning of the movie, the audience can hardly blame a young, motherless outcast of a girl for falling under the spell of Kit, who is young, good-looking, and looks remarkably just like James Dean. So what if he's a garbage collector? When you're fifteen and an older boy is paying attention to you, that hardly matters. Such is the case of our protagonist. Watching this movie, it's hard to decide what makes the movie so enthralling: our male lead, who is clearly mentally ill; our female lead, who is clearly too immature to deal with her boyfriend; or the gorgeous scenery of the Midwest. Terrence Malick made a movie that is both stark and gorgeous, both fascinating and repulsive. He uses music only when it is appropriate to the scene, and the music that he does use is powerful. Like any great artist, Malick knows his craft. I have never seen Martin Sheen handsomer or more convincing. He is able to portray Kit in a way that evokes sympathy and disgust, a rare feat for any actor. Sissy Spacek is wide-eyed and lovely, and this movie hints at her glorious career to come. This is not a movie to watch when you need something uplifting or reassuring, it is far too dark. But Badlands makes for an important commentary on the uniquely American serial killer. It also comments on teenage infatuation, growing up (or the refusal to do so), insanity, and the nature of crime. Malick always leaves enough to the audience's interpretation that we don't feel we're being preached to; however, he gives us enough visual clues and stimulating dialogue to let us come to our own conclusions.
