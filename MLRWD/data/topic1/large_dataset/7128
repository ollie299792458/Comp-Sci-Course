I was very skeptical about even seeing this film based on all of the negative reviews its gotten coupled with the fact that Cabin Fever was supposed to an 80's throwback horror film and it completely sucked.

This film however is a breath of fresh air.  Besides the Saw series I can't even remember the last good American horror movie I've seen...I really can't.  The best part about this movie is that it doesn't take itself seriously and is very campy.  Its got tons of dry humor and is just plain fun.  (unlike the awful texas chainsaw remakes and the like which take themselves so seriously they aren't scary at all.)

The gore factor is way over the top...there are scenes where you can just picture someone on the set just throwing an entire bucket of blood on a tree.  Death scenes are innovative and Victor Crowley is fairly scary considering the campy nature of the film.

If you're looking for a good satire of a horror film then look no further.  This is the type of horror movie that keeps getting better the more you watch it.
