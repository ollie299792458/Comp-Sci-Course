My husband is British and we both loved these guys in Blackadder, so when we saw this set available he recommended I get it (he'd seen the original broadcasts of it).  Well, between the time I ordered and the time we watched the first one, he hyped it so much as "hysterical" and so on, that I was rather disappointed in the first show.  It was "interesting" and "amusing" but I would not have called it "hysterical."  There were a few funny jokes but otherwise just an interesting show to watch.  
However, as we went on watching them, I got more in tune with it, and by Episode 5 I was loving it.  Bertie and Jeeves both use such wonderful hat words and Bertie does use the most alarmingly British phrases!  So, I'm looking forward to the rest of it.  Perhaps they were merely getting into stride in the first few shows.
The one drawback to this is that the actors changed every once in a while.  There was a character named Madeleine Basset and she was played by three different actresses over the course of this series.  There are other characters who were treated similarly; Gussie Fink-Nottle is played by 2 different guys (sadly) and J. Washburn Stoker was played by a couple of different guys too.  But the stories are worth it, as long as you don't get too caught up in this.  I spent a lot of time when they introduced new actors or actresses trying to figure out who they were playing, and then when I found out it was an actor change, spent a lot of time griping about it.  But since I had it on DVD I was able to go back and watch it from the beginning after this was all clear in my head.
