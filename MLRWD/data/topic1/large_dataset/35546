I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but am frustrated at the poor quality production that went into this DVD -- at least in Canada. I went to buy this a few months ago, but an employee at my local video store told me there was a defect on all copies. The audio is out of synch for the last 2 chapters (Scenes 14 and 15) of the film. I was hoping future copies would be fixed. I just checked my newly purchased copy and he was partially right. The audio is delayed by at least 2 seconds, but luckily only in the 5.1 surround sound setting. The more traditional 2.0 stereo audio setting works fine, and the picture and sound are generally great, but this serious failure of production need not have happened.

I'm very disappointed because international and independent films like this get very little attention. Even though this was nominated for an Academy Award for "Best Foreign Film," I doubt it will sell millions of copies in North America. It's obvious that a more popular release would have been given greater respect -- either in the careful attention to its initial production or in quickly issuing a recall to fix the problem. This is a huge insult to fans of non-blockbuster films and especially audiophiles.
