I agree with "tekfighter" on a couple of aspects, that the set does not have english subtitles (nor does SUPERNATURAL, season 1)...

BUT!

This season finally comes into the REAL and TRADITIONAL aspects of the Superman storyline. I have enjoyed the writing and the character deviations (everyone should have an open mind about these things) in the whole 1-4 seasons.  However, having ZOD, and the FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE become introduced in Season 5, we are getting into familiar territory!

Also, introducing James Marsters (YAY, Spike!) as the Brainiac was so thrilling to me, an ANGEL fan (and after much prodding, BUFFY, too!) He has such a fine way of acting, which brings more life to his character and to those acting around him.

Knowing what we Superman fans know, Daddy Jonathan Kent was due to die about the time of Clarks discovery of the Fortress...and indeed, there he went! (and beautifully, too!  What a GREAT death scene! Very touching!!)

I was tickled to see "Bo and Luke" together again in Episode 6, "Exposed"! You could see the joy in their eyes at working together, and the idea to write in such things as jumping in through the car window was a hoot!  The younger generation may not get it, but if they can buy the original Dukes of Hazards, now out on DVD- they would appreciate it, as I did! I'm sure John Schneider appreciated having that opportunity after all these years.

"Reckoning" was a masterpiece in writing, directing and producing.  I was enthralled the whole episode.  Most of the Smallville episodes are fairly predictable, but this one had enough twists and turns to earn my (silent - as nobody else was home) applause.

I don't get the WB channel, or what ever channel that Smallville airs on, so I WAIT until the DVD box set comes out to see the whole season.  This one, Season 5 was worth waiting for!

Keep up the good work!
