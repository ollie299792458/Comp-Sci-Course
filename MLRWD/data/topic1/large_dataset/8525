I was born a year after this movie came out, but I can remember seeing scenes from this through out my childhood. I remember my big sister talking about it and when it came on,and I saw that lead Gargoyle, I thought that this must have been the most horrifying and terrible movie ever made. well flash forward about 37 seven years, and now that I'm building my DVD library, I remembered this one. Only problem is that it's was going for like 72 dollars! Yeah right. It certainly is NOT worth that price. I ordered it on VHS just so I could watch the whole thing again. I enjoyed certain aspects of it, Like the beginning, when they talk about Lucifer,and ancient evils, that really sets a creepy mood. The scenes at the old coot's shed are good. The Gargoyles themselves range from genuinely Scary, to downright goofy looking. One scene when the leader Gar guy brings the human girl back to their caves, and his female Gargoyle mate acts jealous, he sort of caresses her then smacks her on her A$$. I burst out laughing, and all creepiness was long gone. I like movies from the seventies, with their sideburns, and period clothes,not to mention cops that wear cowboy hats are always fun! I recommend this old flick to any monster genre fans,it is a good time, but not for the price it's going for right now. This is a five to six dollar movie, don't pay a fortune for it.
