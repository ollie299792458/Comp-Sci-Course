A lot of fans will look at this and wonder why Jeff Stein and the band did not include any of these songs in "The Kids Are Alright".  My theory is they knew how much better the '75 and '76 shows had been and were disappointed that this performance fell short of their expectations.  The band is a bit rusty; it had been over a year since they'd played live.  After Pete Townshend forgets the break in "I'm Free" and ends the song too early, he comments that they're wasting film.  But even with the mistakes (or maybe because of the mistakes), you can't take your eyes off this film.

Highlights for me include "My Wife", "Summertime Blues", "My Generation" and "Baba O'Riley".  It's a joy to watch Keith, he looks like he's having the time of his life throughout.

I wish that the London Coliseum show on Disc 2 could be cleaned up better. But unfortunately, it is missing sections of film, and there are places where the audio is not great either.  It's a shame, the band were really tight, they'd been playing live for years at this point.

So how can I give this five stars with all the errors and problems?  I give it five stars because the band decided to release this "as is", and we get a front row seat seat watching a band that might just explode at any second.  This is a must own for Who fans!
