Today's films which are mass produced by Hollywood high rollers are filled with high-action expensive stunts that simply aim to bring in a profit.  And though there are some touching stories still filtering through the nation's theatres, Of Mice and Men, is a highly entertaining film that challenges ones ideas about friendship and loyalty.  It is noticeably made on a low budget, and amazingly it will keep your eyes locked on the screen.  I can honestly say that it is the only movie made from a high-school text that was effortless to stay awake during.  The controversial ending coupled with the brilliant acting of Gary Sinise, John Malkovich, and Ray Walston, will make this movie endurable for many years to come.  After reading the novel, it is clear that Malkovich does the finest job of accurately capturing his character, Linny.  He does an unbelievable job of portraying himself as a giant-sized man, with a child-sized brain.  If you are considering watching the movie, you should read the book beforehand and then view the film and see how closely related the two are.  As for the ending, prepare yourself for an emotional scene that will leave you questioning your own ideas on friendship.
