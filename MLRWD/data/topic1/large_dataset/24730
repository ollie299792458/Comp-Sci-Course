WB didn't really promote this movie much, but I finally bought it and it was worth every penny.

While it didn't have the 3d-renders of Justice League Unlimited, the Mystery of the Batwoman had smooth, consistent, high quality animation, an awesome voice cast, and a solid storyline.  This was one of the best things I'd seen out of this continuity of Batman in a looong time.

Don't get me wrong, I loved JL and JLU, as well as Batman Beyond, Batman:TAS, etc.  However, this was the best production to date.

I wish it could have saved us from "The Batman" and "Braniac Attacks."  Those were utter crap.

Waaaaaait.  I know, it wasn't being driven by Bruce Timm.  In the interviews on JL and JLU, I got the idea that he'd abandoned the people who made Batman Beyond and Batman TAS such good projects in favor of his whiny ego.

Perhaps this movie can give someone else the ammo to keep Kevin Conroy as Batman.  His voice is the single best one I've ever heard for Batman and if someone ever resurrects Batman Beyond, I'd love to see him play the elder Batman, whether live action, CGI, animation, whatever.
