Sorry for the ones used with Hollywood kind' a movie. Life it is different. And what a gain if we do accept that life not always ends happy. We should get out and see the pain in this world; because it's plenty!

Now, about the movie; very well put together. An original manner to laugh at the day by day drama. You see in this drama-comedy a society not out completely from the dark tunnels that took her "THE GREAT COMUNISM".

And not only! It is about an old man with one daughter who emigrated in Canada and faced with a harsh life accompanied by two cats. With neighbors not very found of animals and at the hand of Medical Staff that forgot what were suppose to do with their profession, to blinded by their own drama and needs. The gap between generations; old and young doctors part of a medical system that allows them to be superficial when needed most. And is not this the issue in general (come to think o it)???? Where is the difference between a society that measure humanity in zeros when comes to medical assistance and a society that would like to do the same but does not have the zeros?????
