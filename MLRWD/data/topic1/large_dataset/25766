Tunes of Glory is a study in the conflict between two characters, Major Jock Sinclar and Colonel Barrow in a Scottish regiment post World War II.  Sinclair is an up from the ranks officer who is steeped in the traditions  and history, boisterous and hell-raising.  Barrow is a much more  traditional officer, reserved and remote.  From the outset tension is  visible and obvious as Sinclair relinquishes temporary command to Barrow.  Regimental life is a constant theme in this film, something that many  American's have never seen; the concept of the regiment as a family group.  Sinclair has served in the regiment his entire life, Barrow returns to it  only late in his career after initial service in it prior to World War II.  Sinclair prospered in the war, gaining distinction.  Barrow spent his war  in a Japanese POW camp and all that such an event may have held.  The  conflict is continuous and draws other members of the regiment into the  conflict, from other officers to the lynch pins of a Scottish regiment, the  regimental Sergeant Major and the Pipe Major.  All the actors in this film  give excellent support to Guinness and Mills.  The final scene is a  stunning performance by Guinness that is the high point of the film.  For  anyone interested in military themes, this is a markedly different film,  but one that should not be overlooked.
