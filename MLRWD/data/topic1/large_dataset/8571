hollywood makes a big difference, especially with real world topics like street racing. myself, like thousands of street racers who watched this movie noticed the hollywood twists, and turns. like the the 10 minute quarter mile, 4 cars down a track, using NoS after you shift from third, fine looking chicks racing andworking on cars. c'mon, one of the slowest cars i've scene on the quarter mile was around 18 sec., if you street race in cali, you can only race 2 cars down a track, that can barely  fit spectators and the cars that race, NoS is for the take off, turbo does the high end work, and fine chicks working on and racing cars, have you street racers seen lisa kubo? but ..., i liked it. a lot of real world tech. most was done by the editor of super street, which made a god combo with the movie. they had the sponsors, NoS, veilside, hks, greddy, bomex, and the list goes on, including some internet street racing sites. so the cars were close to reality as hollywood would try to bend. reality, yes the cops do bum rush the tracks, and khaos breaks out, especially when the track is poppin, but to sum this short little article up street racing deserves the attention. as an ongoing street racer, i recomend this flick, but if you are a REAL racer, look at what's hollywood, and look at what's REAL!!!
