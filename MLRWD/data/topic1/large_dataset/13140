"Death Wish" depicts its hero as a modern pioneer in an urban setting, who decides to take the law into his hands to protect his life and uphold the honor of his family. Bronson's character, a law-abiding man of liberal leanings, changes his outlook during a trip to Arizona, a "new State", where the values of the pioneer have been vividly preserved. In Arizona he comes to understand that the average American citizen has "unlearned" to use a gun in self-defense. He comes back to New York determined to purge the city of lowlife mugs, whose unchecked brigandage has largely turned it into a new no man's land. As should be expected, the police is all too wary of such a display of independence and tries to curb the mysterious killer. Bronson's enemies turn out to be nearly all non-whites, which once again reminds one of the pioneers' days.

It's easy to understand why the movie was, and still remains, so controversial. It invites to the uneasy reflexion that the majority of us city dwellers may have become too "civilized", and thus an easy prey to savages allowed to live among us.
