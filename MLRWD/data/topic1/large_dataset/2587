I have watched my fair share of anime and seen a few horrible dubs. This is not one of them. Baccano! is one of the three series (Hell Girl and Nerima Daikon Brothers are the others) that I will willingly watch in English. The story takes place in 1930s United States between New York, Chicago, and aboard an transcontinental train, The Flying Pussyfoot. The English dub make the setting much more realistic since the voice actors have the right accents for the characters and the roles they play. I watched a clip in Japanese and it just was not the same.

The plot itself is a confusing mess of chaos and mystery. To be honest, you don't really know everything that is going on until the very last episode, and even the three OVAs help clear up some confusion and unanswered questions in the main series. The entire series skips from 1930 to 1932 back to 1931 and so forth, but you aren't lost. People are introduced fairly quickly and you learn all the names and their relationships to each other. It also helps that the opening credits list the names as they show you their pictures.

The show starts off in the office of the Vice President of The Daily Days' (a newspaper that plays a part in the show) office. The two characters discuss who the main character is. It could be the pair of bumbling thieves, the small child getting his head blown off in the first five minutes, or the smooth-talking gangster who has the strange ability to not stay hurt, but whoever it is, it is up for the watcher to decide whose story to look forward to hearing about the most.

I would recommend this anime to ANYONE. It has a complex plot filled with mystery and suspense, with a dash of humor mixed in. Gangsters, prohibition, speakeasies, immortality, alchemy (no, not Fullmetal Alchemist alchemy), bombs, thieves, crazy costumes, guns, death, madness, and a tad bit of love, what more can one ask for in an anime?
