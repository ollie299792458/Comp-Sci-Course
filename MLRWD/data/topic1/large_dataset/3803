"It's a Wonderful Life" was so very UN-wonderful to the American public when it opened that the only reason that most people have seen it is that it was allowed to go into "public domain" because the studio didn't want to waste the money it would cost to renew the copyright!  
Beaten to death for years by being played on TV stations across America (who could air it for free), it was sometimes shown by three or more competing stations in the same market ... simultaneously.  
Unable to escape this dreadful mush of shmaltz, millions of Americans were exposed to it.  With bits and pieces of it being shown in other films and TV shows (again, for free), there was no way to avoid having this "meme" drilled into one's consciousness.
Seen by itself at some other season than Xmas, shorn of all hoopla, this turns out to be a truly mediocre picture, which has cursed us even more by inspiring even worse remakes, adaptations, and parodies.
"A Christmas Carol" (preferably the Alastair Sim version!!!) is the best Xmas viewing (preferably followed by one of the earlier versions of "Miracle on 34th Street").
IMHO, of course.
