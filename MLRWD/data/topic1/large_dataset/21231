Odyssey
  Sarah Wilcox,  Goochland Virginia  8th Grade  When somebody sayÕs something about an educational video, you donÕt really think of the movie as interesting, or something that you would want to watch again in your free time.  Well, I have a perfect example of a movie that is not boring at all, and is something that I would love to watch again in my spare time.  I recently viewed the movie the Odyssey.  The Odyssey is one of HomerÕs epics.  The Odyssey tells the story of Odysseus and his trip home from the Trojan War.  The Trojan war lasted for 10 years and when Odysseus and his men were on their trip home they encounter many horrible things.  Odysseus eventually arrives home to Ithica after 20 long hard years.  I wonÕt tell you what happens, or all of the details, because I donÕt want to spoil the movie for you.  I believe that the director couldnÕt have picked better actors.  I think that they played their roles very well and really made their characters personalityÕs come to life.  The special effects were wonderful.  The underworld special effects really let you get a good picture in your mind of what they underworld was betrayed to be like. The monster special effects were also very good, it really made you fell like you were being eaten by the monster too.  The movie really helped me to get a better understanding of what the Odyssey  was all about.  I think the Odyssey was a great movie, and that Homer would be very proud.
