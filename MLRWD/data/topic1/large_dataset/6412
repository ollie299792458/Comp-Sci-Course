Let me say this is the first movie from the line of National Lampoon's Vacation movies that I've seen. I saw this with my family the year it was released with my family at the Cinema 12 in Muskegon which is now called the Cinema Carousel and we've watched it every December since. Having said that I watch this movie on my own any month of the year I want to as I now own it for myself. Teenagers will relate to the charachter of Audrey, pre teens will relate to Rusty, and many adults will relate to the stress Clark Griswold has at being such an everyman who tries to keep the family together while having a few disasters commited by him or herself plus the rest of the goofy relatives.
  Now that I'm old enough to do so I also own the original Vacation which came out the year after I was born as well as European Vacation which came out not so long after but Christmas Vacation was and still is the best of the series. It's good for laughs at Holiday time or any other time of the year. My favorite scene? The squirrel and dog chase. My reason for that is a squirrel got into our house the year before the movie came out and our family's comments at that time were like lines out of the movie. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that young kids or easily offended people should steer clear of it but for those of us who understand the humor and relate to it it's an absolute must have.
