Please don't watch this movie. It will turn you off to the great writing of James Kirkland. If you read the book and watched this movie you'll know what I mean. It's an insult to James Kirkland. I agree with most of the other one star ratings - no need to write it over and over.

I'd been hoping to see this book turned into a movie since I was a young teenager, when I first read the book. Like millions of others I've read it more than once. I've read it so many times the book is worn out. I was hoping to see Sal Mineo perform it on stage, but he was taken from us by a crazed junky. This movie would have been fantastic with Mineo or a younger Dustin Hoffman (heck, Hoffman can still do it) as the burgular.

I really do hope someone tries again to make a movie from the book, staying true to the book in every way - if the next person who makes this movie deliberately sets it in the 70s (cars, clothes, attitudes and all) then it can stay true to the book 100% and will be great!

I know just about everyone who has ever read a book that went to film has bad things to say about the movie version, but this time it's 1000% true, the movie is not worth watching. Sorry Steve.
