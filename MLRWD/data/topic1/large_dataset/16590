The intensity of this movie comes from the tension between the character of Jimmy "the Tulip" Tudeski, played by Bruce Willis, and Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky, played by Matthew Perry. The former is a notorious hit man and the latter is a miserable dentist whose wife wants him to die soon in order to get his life insurance money. When Oz, in all his innocence and fear, gets to know Jimmy the situation begins to get increasingly humorous. Jimmy's quirks of believing divorce a crime and hating mayonnaise on his hamburger add another twist to the humor. The story itself becomes more twisted when Oz falls in love with Cynthia, Jimmy's ex-wife, and Jimmy eventually falls in love with Jill, an assassin who was hired by Oz's wife to kill Oz. In a situation heating up by the moment, Oz offers to resolve the situation by planting a duplicate copy of Jimmy's teeth on a dead cop's corpse. Being then officially dead, Jimmy finds himself no longer the husband of Cynthia and the death certificates of Jimmy and his former mob boss Janni Gogolak turns out to be worth ten million dollars. The complexity of love and humor between a hit man and a dentist keeps the intensity of the humor high right to the end.
