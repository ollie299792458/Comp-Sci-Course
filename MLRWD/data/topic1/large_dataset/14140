I know there is a lot of controversy about this movie, mainly with the fact that it has nothing to do with the book. I have seen a very old film that I would guess is from the 80s or earlier that follows the book pretty closely, I watched this in school a long time ago. As for this rendition, it is just taking a few key concepts from the book and the rest is from the writers imagination.

You're probably wondering why I gave this movie 5 stars. Well, for one, it has Demi Moore and Gary Oldman. Demi Moore is not one of my favorites, but she fits this role nicley. Gary Oldman has not been in many substantial roles in movies, but I like him in anything he does. Not to mention, he is gorgeous in this movie...and you get to see quite a bit of him...let's just say it's not for the kids. Either way, I thought both of them did an amazing job and they have great chemistry with each other that is perfect for their roles. You can feel the emotion in every scene.

Now, I would say this is more for the girls than the guys. It's a great movie to watch alone with a bowl of popcorn and tissues close by. I have never read a romance novel, but I would say that if you like those, you will surely appreciate this movie. This movie deserves at least one run through. I won't give away any spoilers, but I actually liked this version of the Scarlet Letter better than the original *gasp*
