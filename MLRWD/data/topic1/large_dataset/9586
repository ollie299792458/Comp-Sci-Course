"I love you Alyssa, I always will, because of who you are and what you've meant to me." ~ Affleck's character to Adam's
I love Kevin Smith, and I admit it right now that I am a Jay and Silent Bob fanatic!  I first discovered Kevin Smith seeing Chasing Amy, and later learned of Clerks and Mallrats, which came out before Chasing Amy, and ran out and bought them before seeing them for the first time, I was not dissapointed however.  No matter how much I love all the Kevin Smith movies Chasing Amy will always be my favorite Smith film, even with the release of Dogma and the more recent Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  The story line and characters make Chasing Amy a hit because its unline any movie anyone has ever seen.  I mean, come on, how many movies have you seen where the basic plot is a lesiban becoming stright when she meets the right man, only to become a lesiban once again when asked by that man to be apart of a threesome with his bestfriend, who is possibly a homosexual.  I can only think of one movie I've ever seen like that -- Chasing Amy.
