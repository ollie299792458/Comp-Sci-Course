This is a tough but absolutely stunning movie - but the packaging is a catastrophy!

The film poster (and DVD cover) for Hard Candy is one of the absolute best posters/covers in the last ten years.

To replace that with the stupid cover on the Blu-ray is a disgrace, Lionsgate! What is the bear trap doing on that cover? The only way to use that bear trap is the way it was used on the original!

...and I just noticed that Lionsgate have spoiled the cover on Secretary as well - with the same kind of bland nothingness. It looks like the same design - you should REALLY fire the guy responsible!

A cover is supposed to get you interested in the film and also tell you a little about what you can expect from the film.

These covers are completely non-descriptive and uninterresting - and I doubt very much they will sell copies.

The only reason I am still buying the films in Blu-ray is because I already love them, and want them in the best possible resolution.

Please get a grip, and fire that guy!
