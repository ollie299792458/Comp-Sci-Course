Having made it through 4 of 5 seasons so far with 1 to go, we have thoroughly enjoyed a series so full of originality and creativity. I doubt that something amazing like this will ever grace its face on the TV for a very long time.

The only criticism I have is of the commentaries. Because of the plethora of directors and writers involved with the series, you will encounter a variety of commentaries from very good to very lame, however, most are just good. The commentaries on Sex and The City are far superior. However, the main point I wanted to make to folks is that many of the commentaries include spoilers for future episodes. It was a bit disappointing, having just seen an episode that left you hanging, to find out what happens while watching that same episode afterwards with commentary. The creator of the series Alan Ball is probably the worst one at giving away hints of future episodes (of course, for those who have already seen the entire series, it is not a big deal). So you might decide to hold off watching the commentaries until you have seen all episode of that particular season. I should say that many of the commentaries are very insightful and provided content and background to things folks often miss watching.
