The year is 1968. Vietnam is heating up in a major way. Civil Rights marchers and rioters in the streets. The Martin Luther King assassination and The Democratic National Convention. And an odd, cynical, pointed, hilarious, and tragic movie is playing in the local theaters about a world that is ruled by apes and men are ignorant, mute animals. All the comment seems to be about just how fantastic the makeup job for each of the different ape species is. But of far more importance is the message of this movie, of man's built-in aggressiveness, of his disdain for the 'lower' creatures of this world, about self-blinding arrogance, fanaticism, and prejudice. A message that is delivered via some fine acting performances by Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowell, and Charlton Heston, and an intelligent script by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson, based on the novel by Pierre Boulle. 
This was the original. All the sequels and remakes (including this year's attempt) pale in comparison to it. Still, this is not an all-time great classic. Too much of its impact depends on the surprise ending, which should not have been any surprise at all, given the impossible coincidences of certain plants and animals just 'happening' to evolve in exactly the same fashion on two different planets. But in as much as it speaks to all with humor and insight about common truths, and will make people do a little thinking about their own built-in biases, it is a fine movie, well worth seeing.
