Everybody knows what Conan is about, so I won't bore you with that. What I *will* say is that this is some sort of director's cut, with several scenes in it I'd never seen before (and I'm a die-hard Conan fangirl). The scenes help the movie considerably. There are a few deleted scenes regarding King Osric included as freebies and a little deleted scene of the director as a peasant selling Conan lizard-on-a-stick in Zamora, but these are fribble and not in the actual movie. The included scenes include a vastly expanded role for Osric's daughter (didn't you wonder why she even got billing? In the VHS edition she gets about as much screen time and dialog as the half-naked sacrificial victim in the Tower where the jewel was) and some explanatory stuff that helped the movie flow better. I can't imagine why they were cut to begin with, but they made the movie as fresh to watch this time as it was the first time I saw it.
There's some "making of" stuff that was fun to watch, some stuff we'd seen before and lots of new stuff -- a very frail Max von Sydow talking about how he took the role of Osric because his kid was into the comics, a suprisingly mature Sandahl Bergman talking about how her finger got severed during a fight scene, the composer telling how he composed Valeria's funeral song after a terrible nightmare about his own family dying... The director also explains how he decided upon his cast, which was neat, and set producers and animal handlers talk about their particular challenges. I'd never seen or heard most of this before, so that was interesting. The "archives" show onsite photos and drawings and whatnot, which didn't do a ton for me but which others might find interesting. A small bio of whatshisname who wrote the Conan books is given.
I already owned this on VHS, and bought the DVD because I was afraid my tape was wearing out. I'm glad I got it. The new cut is a delight!
