I originally bought this DVD for Hitch's "Suspicion".  I'm a fan of his and Cary Grant, so it was a win win for me.  I prefer the older movies that made you think or entertained you without worrying about if there's a scene you don't won't your children to see.  After watching the other three movies, I was thrilled.  I loved them all.  "Strangers on a Train" took stalking and manipulation to a whole new level.  "The Wrong Man" made me very grateful we no longer rely on just eyewitnesses, but DNA.  At the end of the movie, Henry Fonda gives the eyewitnesses a look that says more and does more than any words could have.  "I Confess" shows a priest, his ex, and the wife of the man who confesses being truly tested and tempted, but in the end all three risk everything to do what's right.  The three had various reasons for doing so like love, faith in God, guilt, and doing what was right no matter what was the cost.  The man who confesses on the other hand loses everything due to thinking only of himself.  In the end he was still shown mercy by the priest who tries to guide him back to God.
Originally I thought I would like "Suspicion" the best.  I still like it, but the other movies are definitely equally good.  I could easily argue why each was the best, but I think it would be more fun for you to just by it and decide for yourself.
