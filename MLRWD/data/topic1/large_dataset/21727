Let's face it: if you're wondering whether or not to buy Tron: Legacy 3D Blu Ray, you know if you like the movie or not, and are more concerned with the image quality and sound quality. Let me start by saying this is the first 3D blu ray I've purchased (my television came with Avatar 3D). I use a Panasonic 50 in. plasma, with active 3D. I have a pretty run of the mill surround sound stereo that I ran straight from my PS3 through AV cords. In other words, my television is fantastic, but my sound leaves something to be desired.

The 3D of Tron in theaters was, in my oppinion, the fourth best at the time of its release (Avatar, How to train your Dragon, and Toy Story 3 were above it). In my home however, this film looked fantastic. The depth of the 3D was great and the quality of the image is met only by Avatar's 3D Blu Ray. There are scenes that were filmed for IMAX and, like The Dark Knight, the blu ray keeps this aspect ratio for Tron. Personally, I loved this, my only complaint being that it makes the non-IMAX scenes feel less exciting.

The sound was another high point for this movie. The soundtrack is phenomenal and I can only imagine that on a better sound system, this would be the best sounding movie released on blu ray yet (them's fightin' words!).

All-in-all, buy this. It's a fun movie with an even better presentation that will make you satisfied with your 3D television purchase.
