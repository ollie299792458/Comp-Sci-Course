I am so weary and tired of reading 'silly', lightweight and shallow comments about this movie (though not too many on this site). Stupid comments such as 'the sixth sense was a much better movie' are laughable. The trailer for this movie was edited by a company who didn't quite know how to 'sell' it. They implied strongly that the movie involved a link with the spirit world and coupled with the title this attracted the 'wrong' audience. As a result this touching movie experience was slated by the critics and bored thousands of guys who thought they would be able to cuddle and protect their girlfriends during a spooky cimema experience. Instead they wished they'd brought a clean hankerchief to wipe their girls tears. Be certain of one thing, this is a superb, realistic, human drama, which has a tender, sensitive, and in many ways 'sad' story to tell. I am not spoiling anything by telling you that ghosts and the undead are 'never' implied in any scene. Those of you who need to be spoon-fed a story, or require explosions every few minutes, or sit patiently waiting for the big slam-bang fanale, will not enjoy this movie. Too many others have written very mature and deep reviews about this movie and I think it pointless to repeat much of that. But I will say this; Angel Eyes is a great achievment and it effortlessly touches the soul. Human drama's can sometimes be boring and tedious and ultimately uninvolving. But if you allow this movie to carry you without trying to pre-guess the story, then you are in for a truly delightful treat. Oh and you women out there....it might be an idea to have a box of tissues handy...
