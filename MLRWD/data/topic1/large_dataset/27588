Yet another retelling of the Pinochio story about a robot (Robin Williams) who strives to become human. In the process he gains self-awareness, invents artificial organic-mechanical hybrid organs, learns to love and eventually die. What he strives for is humanity and I have to question, what is so great about being human that one would give up a rich, productive and essentially immortal life and choose to die? That is the central point of the movie and the explanation is filled with lots of sentimental new-age platitudes that are heaped on top of this movie with cynical smugness. The screenwriters primary job seems to be to manipulatively reinforce the belief that humans are somehow innately superior by the simple fact of their humanity and all that entails. I'm just not buying it. This is at best middle brow entertainment masquerading as humanist discourse and is Robin Williams second most icky role (see the insufferable Patch Adams for his worst), being filled with ridiculous "moving" and "noble" speeches on the virtue of humanity, blah blah blah. Mr. Data wants his motivation back. But then what did I expect? This is big budget Hollywood entertainment so be prepared not to have your heartstrings tugged, but yanked and yanked hard. I don't have the time to wallow in sentimental drivel and I wish I could have the time I spent watching this thing back.
