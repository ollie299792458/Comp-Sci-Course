A friend had recommended this movie since she knew I had recently read the book "House of Evil". I truly feel this movie did not tell Sylvia Likens story accurately, they left out many details and I was a little upset on how they portrayed Gertrude in this. Now while I do feel some remorse for the events that transpired through Gertrude's life. I really feel this film made her seem to soft, while she did horrific acts to Sylvia and even when she did things to her, she just did not come across as the Gertrude I read about.

I feel changing the events of what happened and HOW they happened, was completely wrong. I know movies can only interpet so much into film and small things will be changed. But the director truly did not show the chaos going on in that house, and just how many kids would come in and out.

I certainly did not like the ending, but to people who are unaware of the real events. I feel will give them possibly the inclination to know more and possibly read more into this crime.

I did also see "The Girl Next Door" and while that movie is LOOSELY based on Sylvia Likens story, this was the first movie I had seen and this was what piqued my interest to even know if that was based on real events. And I truly feel how the Mother came across in that movie, was more of an interpretation of how I felt Gertrude would be.

Which I tried watching again, and I can not bring myself to finish, which I am feeling I know something like this did happen to someone. It makes it a whole different level when you know it's partly true.

I plan to watch "An American Crime" and will update my review if I change my mind about any points I have made. But I strongly recommend reading the book, "House of Evil" instead of watching either movie, the book alone is horrific.
