My boyfriend bought this for my daughter and we all sat down to watch it.  His brother (in his late 20's) wanted to watch it also and came over.  My daughter loved it, a lot.  The younger brother didn't have anything to say except wonder if we liked it.  Our reply was it was sorta okay.

First off, we never read the books, and I wasn't aware it was based off one.  The CGI in this movie is very good.  There are some breathtaking views.  The different kinds of owls were pretty accurate visually.  I didn't notice the music much, but what I did notice was pretty.  It never got in the way or seemed like too much for the current action.

Otherwise.. the storyline was pretty dry.  You have 3 owlettes.  the oldest boy seems to think he's oh so grown up.  Wants to be all serious.  Dreams and play are for babies, blah blah.  The brother has a natural gift for flight and he's jealous of him.  The kid sister is sweet and all around just loves everyone and likes to have fun.  The brothers get kidnapped and one flees for help, and makes a couple friends on the way.  Not extremely unique here, or particularly engaging.  In my opinion the only thing going for this movie is the obvious care that went into the visual aspect.  As far as the storyline.. if it was based off a book they only have so much to work with.

So I will give it a safe 3.  The kids will probably love it if they aren't in highschool yet, but all three adults were pretty bored.

The "hey this could make a sequal" ending was sadly the most interesting part.
