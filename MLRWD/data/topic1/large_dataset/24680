Season Six of Weeds was a really enjoyable surprise. It is an entirely different season, as it is driven by increasing more suspenseful plot lines, several of which are very good, clever and quite successful.

The series really moves away from its "mom sells pot" genesis and becomes a bit of a "buddy / road" movie. Which is OK, its just different.

Where it really shines is the performances of Andy, Silas and Shane. They all have much more to work with. Andy, as always, is given the best dialogue. Shane and Silas really develop a rapport and have some important plot contributions. The Nancy character is fine, but becomes (in our opinion) ever more detestable! Hey, its not bad acting, just a bad character in the middle of an entertaining situation. Doug is along for the ride and several previous Weeds characters make cameo appearances.

Other reviewers mention "poor writing" but I think they are missing the point, or don't know what they are talking about. The writing is just fine, sometimes really great. The difference is the plotting, which is a huge change from the great Seasons 1 and 2.

In many ways its an entirely different show with familiar characters.
