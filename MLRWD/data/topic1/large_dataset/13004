I love this movie.  Not only is it exciting, hysterically funny and totally original, it helped me get in touch with my inner chicken.  Ginger is my new heroine.  Julia Sawalha's voice captured Ginger's personality, warmth, intelligence and "humanity" perfectly.  Her initial escape attempts are perfect satirizations of "The Great Escape", right down to throwing the baseball against the wall while in the "cooler".  I also appreciated the serious undertone of death that hung over the movie.  We saw that the threat is real and that added to the urgency.  I also loved the big dance number, the fact that the other chickens had distinct personalities, and that the Tweety's were terrific villians.  This movie also proved that chickens do indeed have lips... and teeth!  And how expressive those teeth are.  And listen closely at the end to rats' variation on what came first: the chicken or the egg.  VERY funny.  I want to see another movie with these characters.  I want to know what happens next.
