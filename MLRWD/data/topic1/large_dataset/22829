12/07: The tagline for The Crush is "He thought it was just a crush. He was dead wrong." I am thinking to myself, "Why is the film still called The Crush?" Anyway, the movie is not bad at all. Most of the time, the plot is entirely plausible. Of course, Nick Eliot, played well by Cary Elwes, didn't think his problem out better than anticipated. For anyone watching The Crush could learn from this experience and know better what to do with a severely under-aged girl when it comes to inappropriate relations, especially sex. This is happening at an alarming rate in America today and even more so in schools. The story behind The Crush is serious stuff, and I thought the film was executed very well. Yeah, Alicia Silverstone is a candidate for Worst Actress Ever, but she did fine in the film. The cast were good enough to pull it off. Really, what made The Crush to be watchable is the premise of it. It's just that the movie wasn't suspenseful or unpredictable enough.
