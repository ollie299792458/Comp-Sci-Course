This is the 1970 movie of JULIUS CAESAR, starring Charlton Heston as Antony.

To my mind, it's every bit as good as the earlier, b&w version with Marlon Brando as Antony, though the later BBC version directed by Herbert Wise (who made I, CLAUDIUS) may be the best of the lot, partly because it renders the play virtually uncut. (It's available at Amazon in the set "BBC Shakespeare Tragedies DVD Giftbox".)

All three versions have strong points and weaknesses. The biggest weakest here is the strangely mis-calibrated performance by Jason Robards as Brutus; I think he intended to project quiet fortitude in the first half of the play, but he seems to be moving in a trance. Much better is the Casca of Robert Vaughn (yes, the Man from U.N.C.L.E.), a young and dashing Richard Chamberlain as Octavius, and John Gielgud as Caesar.

The production is visually pleasing, with sets and costumes that for the most part are historically accurate but sometimes have a slight Elizabethan touch, as if to remind us of the play's origins.

BTW, the spelling of Shakespear without a final e is not incorrect; this is a variant of the name which is actually the preferred spelling in some countries.

Footnotes: Before his official movie debut in the early 1950s, Heston played the role of Antony in an independent production of JULIUS CAESAR, which is now available on DVD, and he again played Antony when he directed his own, quite excellent movie version of ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA (which, alas, is not available on DVD as of 2006.)
