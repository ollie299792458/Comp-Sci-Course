In the barren wasteland of fall movies "based on true stories" about social networking and such BS mish-mash movies, I was left with Jackass 3D and RED.  I wanted to see Jackass initially, but I decided to wait for the DVD.  I still liked the guys who maim themselves for my entertainment and wanted to support them, but the 3D aspect was a little much.

I was told by two people that RED was a great ride and very fun.  I knew the people I was speaking with and I knew their views on movies.  I went and saw it.  Bruce Willis is very John McClane-ish and the movie was a blast!

Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich were great!

Karl Urban was a great addition.  I look forward to seeing him in other roles outside of Star Trek again.  Especially, the new Judge Dredd film.

Ernest Borgnine was a very welcome addition to the cast.  It was good to see him acting again.

You want a fun 1980s/1990s action feel of a fun pop corn movie?  Then go see RED.
