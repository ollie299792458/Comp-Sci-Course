I couldn't wait to buy Season 5. I pre-ordered it without reading any reviews. Then I read the reviews and was concerned. So, before I pushed the play button on the DVD player, I warned my husband that we probably weren't going to like Season 5. WELL, we have watched all of Season 5 twice now and I really don't understand the negative reviews at all. It seems to me that some folks just don't like change, which is understandable, but have an open mind, folks! Sometimes change is refreshing and for the best. Yes - Aunt Joan is not in the show and you'll find out why in the second episode, but another one of Martin's aunts, Aunt Ruth (superbly played by Eileen Atkins) inherits Joan's farm and adds unique interest to the show in our opinion. And yes, Pauline is gone, but so what? I'm not sure I wanted another season of her fluffy frocks and whiney voice anyway - though the character was fun and Katherine Parkinson did an awesome job. Most of the other townspeople are there. Louisa (Carolyn Catz) is as beautiful as ever, and the baby is absolutely adorable. I don't want to give away too much, but you can tell that Doc really does care for his little son, as weird as the Doc is. We love Doc Martin and will be first in line to pre-order Season 6 - if there is one!
