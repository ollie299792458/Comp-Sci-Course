This is a skeleton of a movie. It's plot can be described in a series of statements: a boy likes a girl, she likes him back briefly, then he is very sad. I believe that the merit of this film is that it is so very thin and cliched, you can project your own lovelorn experiences onto the characters. There are cutesy indie references to listening to the Smiths in the elevator and reading "Dorian Gray" in a deli, but nothing unique is actually said or done. Zooey Deschanel and Joesph Gordon-Levitt have starred in a film together before- "Manic" and it's completely different, but if you're interested in this movie for the actors and wouldn't mind a film of much greater intensity, I would strongly it over "500 Days of Summer."
Also, I'm not down on this movie because I don't like somewhat fluffy stories about love that isn't working out, I do like those. Just not as idiotically fluffy as this. If you just broke up from a relationship and want to watch something to project your feelings on, I would recommend "Love Me If You Dare."
