I remember watching this mini series on TV as a kid back in the 70's and enjoying it. I saw it at Best Buy for about $50 and was going to buy it, but I thought about checking Amazon first. Good thing that I did because it was a lot cheaper here. Centennial tells the story of how America was made from the view point of several characters. I found Centennial to be just as entertaining (if not more now) as I did watching it as a 5-6 year old. For the 70's the cast was considered all-star though most of the younger generation will not know who most of the cast is. Even though it was made in the 70's I did not get the feeling that the mini series was dated as being a 70's movie. This is probably mostly due to the period costumes that were worn. Centennial also brought up problems of pollution, overuse, race, and injustice that are hot issues today, but they identified these issues over 30 years ago. The collection gives you over 20 hours of mostly enjoyable viewing (although in my opinion the last two episodes are sort of boring, especially when they start filming in the present day 1970's) introducing different characters as time goes from the late 1600's to 1970's Colorado. I think that this a classic series and an entertaining way to learn about how America might have been made.
