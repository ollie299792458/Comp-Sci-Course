During the opening 20 minutes, I had fears Vexille was a soulless action flick.  The graphics (it is computer generated, after all) look like what we might see at the end of the Playstation 3's lifecycle, or in the next generation of consoles, not as impressive as, say, Advent Children, yet they are extremely expressive, bringing us elements from hand-drawn animation.  The characterization is, at times, shallow, and the storyline trite and at firstly nonsensical, but by the end of the film, viewers will find themselves impressed by how everything has come together, given something moving to hold onto that was more memorable and interesting (at least to me) than the lauded action sequences, sort of an allegorical analysis of what it is to be human, in the standard Japanese mold of never giving up, and isn't that why we like a good story anyway, to learn more about ourselves?

Lovers of Japan might be especially affected.  I was.

As far as the voice acting, I can't comment on the English, as I viewed it with the Japanese dialog on.
