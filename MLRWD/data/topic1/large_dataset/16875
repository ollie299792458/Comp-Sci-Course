"Standing in the shadows of Motown" is an amazing trip into the past, but what is truly amazing is the way it is put together. It is a story told by the band members all relating about the situations and music at the time; personal stories of good times and bad. It is not until you have watched the movie several times that you realize the impact these people had on the music and how many, many, songs they actually did. After watching it the 6th time, I was able to identify almost every song from my personal collection that was done by this band...truly the sound OF Motown. Incredible. Artist after artist, song after song, all the same bunch of musicians, putting their souls into every song. After watching these guys playing together again for this documentary style movie, you can see and feel the pleasure they all experienced the moment they heard themselves together again, most especially if you've ever been a member in a tight band. All that talent and creativity behind anyone, would have made that person a star, as happened many, many times, but no one knew the band that made the singers famous, but guaranteed everyone has heard those songs a thousand times. The band was known as "The Funk Brothers"; the sound engine behind hit, after hit, after hit! The more you watch it, the more you have to appreciate them and what they did for all of the 'Baby Boomers' out there. And make sure you pay careful attention to the end of the movie. There they list the all the songs they powered into our hearts. WOW! Enjoy.
