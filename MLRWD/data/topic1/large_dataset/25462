When I first saw the previews for this movie, I thought it appeared to be too mushy and maybe just not the type of movie for me, but I guess I was wrong.

This movie makes you change your mind about wanting to change the past.  It delves into the idea that you could cause the past to change simply by taking your mind back to that point in time and ... well ... changing the sequence of events.  The only thing is, when you change one aspect of the past, the entire future changes as well.  Sometimes you should just leave well enough alone.

I did not expect the ending, but you come to realize it is the only way the movie could really end.  It can be a bit slow at times but overall it is a real attention getter.  Be prepared to at least get a little teary eyed at least near the end.  There are some disturbing scenes and some tear jerkers.

Overall, good movie.  I am not a big fan of Ashton Kutcher but enjoyed his role in this movie.

Yet another great addition to my movie collection!
