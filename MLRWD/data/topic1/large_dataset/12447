I never cared for John Wayne, the person. I always resented the fact that while my father was getting his arse shot off in WW2, Wayne hid behind having several children to avoid the draft. While my father was overseas, Wayne was in Hollywood making money.  I also thought it ironic he made so many war films while safe and sound in the United States while so many weren't.  His "All American" stance was just another Hollywood lie. If you doubt me, look it up on GOOGLE by typing in "John Wayne and WW2".

That said - and I'm sure many of you Wayne fans will be upset with me over it, but I don't really care - THE SHOOTIST is, in my opinion, the best movie he ever made. He shows a dignity (and acting skills) I'd not see in his previous films. The addition of Lauren Becall and Ron Howard to the cast, along with several fine character actors, like Richard Boone, has made this Wayne film a classic.

Basic story line: A dying gun fighter has shown up in a quiet little town to spend his last days in a pleasant rooming house. James Stewart as the doctor give him the bad news (something he already knew but wanted confirmed), while Becall runs the rooming house with Howard as her almost out of control son. "J.B. Books" (Wayne) gradually becomes a sort of father figure to Howard, showing him the rights and wrongs in his way of living.  The ending, while fairly predictable, is also touching with the Books character ending his career in a way totally suitable to the situation.
