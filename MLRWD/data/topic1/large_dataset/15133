I'm seventeen years old, and I'm surprised that I'm one of the few people that didn't watch this movie as a child. Being one of the people raised on fantasy movies as a child, I found this movie to be moving, enchanting, and fantastically magical! I've seen many reviews of this movie in which some people detested it or even called most of the elements, plot, visuals, etc. just mediocre. But I just want to say, that beyond the movie critics' reviews, there are the average people who are not related in any way to the film industry, who have watched this movie and simply been moved. For me, it takes a lot for a movie to actually fall onto my must-watch list. This is one of those movies. It is magical, whether you watch it as a child or later on in life, you will be touched, I'll almost asure you. Many people say it falls behind in the Fantasy/Adventure genre, saying that there are other movies out there that topped this one. I've seen many fantasy movies, The Princess Bride, The Labyrinth, etc. and I've loved them all, but if I had to pick which one I was touched the most by, this would be the one! Val Kilmer and Warwick Davis give absolutely amazing performances as well as the rest of the cast, although the one thing that did annoy me was the appearance of the BROWNIES. I didn't feel that they were needed that much in the film, they just kind of got in the way. But as for the enchanting tale of finding an abandoned princess who will eventually destroy the evil queen and tracking out on an unforgettable adventure-- that's the kind of story that will stay in your memories and your children's memories for years to come! I would highly recommend this movie to anyone out there, fantasy lover or not!
