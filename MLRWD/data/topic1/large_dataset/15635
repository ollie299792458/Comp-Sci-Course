I wish this movie was available on DVD!  I saw this movie for the first time in high school -- I liked it then but not nearly as much as when I viewed it upon graduating college.  This movie is for anyone who's ever attended college and experienced it with a group of close friends.  It still makes me sentimental to watch the movie and recall the friends who I pulled through and who pulled ME through college -- alcoholics, drug users, people who were suicidal, people who were highly political, people who didn't care anything about politics, people who "stole" girlfriends and people who simply never understood what college was about or what was expected to happen after college.  It would be impossible for anyone whose experienced college life not to relate to at least one character or scene within this movie.  When I attended a recent reunion, myself and a group of friends were required to come to the aid of another friend who was being arrested.  After defusing the situation, I quietly said:  "Wow, reminds me of St. Elmo's Fire".  All of my friends fell quiet for a moment -- watch the movie and you will understand.
