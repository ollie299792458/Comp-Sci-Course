This was one of the few movies that I saw in the theater more  once.  (I even sat in the first row one time.)  
On one level, "The Last Dragon" is a spoof of martial arts movies, peopled with bad guys Sho' Nuff (Julius Carry is a scream!) the self-proclaimed "Shogun of Harlem," and video magnate-wanna-be Eddie Arkadian (sp?).  They're idiots, but are serious threats for the movie's hero, Leroy.
Leroy is a Bruce Lee wanna-be to the point of being a nerd, but his heart is truly good, and this leads us to the second level of the movie:  the path within, and where true mastery may be found.
Leroy's sifu sends Leroy on that journey, for he can teach Leroy no more.  The rest is up to our hero.
A chance encounter with veejay Laura Charles (Vanity) lead Leroy to think there might be more to life than martial arts.
The soundtrack is great, the action is great (look for Ernie Reyes Sr. and young Ernie Reyes Jr. together in a fight scene) and the message of the movie is timeless truth.
