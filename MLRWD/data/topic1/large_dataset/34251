This version has a lot of footage, but is still missing large pieces that make the continuity very choppy. The picture quality is fair, and my overall sense is that the producers of this video just rounded up the  footage from whatever they could find. There is not a great deal of concern  shown for the overall quality of the product. The most disappointing  element about this version is, that, it has one of the most annoying sound  tracks I have ever experienced with a silent film. I got the sense that the  producers of this version really don't understand the purpose that a  soundtrack serves in enhancing the emotional elements portrayed on the  screen. There is no one credited to the soundtrack of this version and I  can understand why, as it is nothing more than 136 minutes of annoying  noise that detracts from an otherwise remarkable film. I ended up turning  off the sound which helped somewhat. If you really want to experience this  film at its best, hold out for the Giorgio Moroder restored version.
