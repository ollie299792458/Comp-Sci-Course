Terrific performances by Pierce Brosnan and Liam Neeson raise Seraphim Falls to near classic status among films of the western genre.  Driven by the will to survive and unrelenting vengeance, these two veteran actors completely discard their personas as screen heroes and battle each other through snowy mountains, unforgiving parched deserts, and an unmerciful high plains landscape to see who can kill each other first.  Neeson and his henchmen are the pursuers and Brosnan is the pursued, who both play out their drama of savagery in a surprisingly labyrinthine plot guaranteed to keep the viewer perched on the seat's edge.  What drives Neeson so compellingly to want to do away with Brosnan?  The audience finally discovers the existence of a brutal incident that happened in the shared past of the two men.  Long ago, the incident became a searing fire stoking Neeson's wrath.  The film has a well-conceived ending offering a strong message about the folly and self-devastation resulting from all-consuming vengeance and savagery.  Against this grim plotline, the movie offers some of the most stunning cinematography imaginable.  Comparable to "Shane" in its beauty.  A film to see!!!
