This is the most disappointing Blu-Ray movie I have ever purchased. It is not the picture quality or the story line - both of which are fantastic... it is the poor sound quality - which is why you buy a blu-ray movie in the first place and one expects top rate sound quality.

We have considered returning this movie to Amazon - the first one I have ever been prompted to do - as we feel it is a disc that has somehow slipped through the system and is defective in the quality one expects and rightly anticipates with the blu-ray technology.

We used to own this movie on Laser Disc where the sound quality was first class.  But on the blue-ray, with the volume turned right up on a sytsem that only uses three tenths volume as a rule of thumb, one could still barely hear the conversation which was faint and hardly crisp or distinct at all.

Were it not for the cost of returning the product to the USA, it would have been in the mail weeks ago.  It was not an expensive disc to buy in the first place, and so we feel that Amazon knew it had purchased 'a lemon' and was selling it off cheap.

So on sound quality, I rate it less than one star. The rest is top class ---- but it is the sound effects that 'make' or break a movie - so that is very important aspect of the enjoyment one expects when one has first rate equipment to play first rate DVD technology on.

We already had a previously purchased "The Hunt for The Red October" on standard DVD, so after half an hour of hoping the blu-ray edition would 'pick up in quality', we took it off and put on the standard DVD version...and here the sound quality was perfect by comparison... though the picture quality was not as good as the blu-ray version. From this we determined that the blu-ray disc was faulty and made moves to apply for a return to Amazon for a refund; the follow through of which we have not yet actioned.
