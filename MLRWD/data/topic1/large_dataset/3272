Ok so here is the run down. 5 college students go to a secluded cabin in the middle of spooky and smokey woods(are we getting a premonition yet?)While there, they come across the Necrinomicon Ex Mortis(The Book Of The Dead) and a tape recorder with incantations from the book on it. And, of course, They play the tape, release evil, become possesed, the whole 666 yards. I know  that you have seen a movie like that before, but you don't understand what makes the movie so great. the effects, while (not great), are simpley amazing. Decomposing zombies, (...) trees(cool), Lots of dismemberment. and, of course, Gallons upon gallons of everybody's favorite Plasmatic substence,BLOOD! Enough about the movie. Let's move on to the DVD itself. A steep little on the price, but well worth it. The 2 commentaries(one by director Sam Raimi, one by star and co-producer Bruce Campbell) are amazing! Raimi's is a good look on how the movie was made. Campbell's, on the other hand, is just funny!Now, don't be fooled. The "Behind-the-scenes" is nothing special. Just a bunch of cuts and inaudioble advice to the actors. No interviews, no funny outtakes, but still cool! This movie spawned two sequels. Both great. Not as scary, but good. Oh, to all the people who say evil dead 2 is a remake of the first one... WRONGWRONGWRONG!!! Watch the end of evil dead. Remember what happens? And how that happens at the BEGINNING of the second one? SEQUEL!! The first part of Dead by Dawn is Just a quick recap. Listen to the commentary. They said they had to reshoot the opening because they could not get the film from the film company for some reason. OK. That is the end of my rant. (...) so in summary, BUY THIS DVD!!! And if you are ever in a secluded cabin in the middle of the spooky and smokey woods, don't read any books, and DON'T PLAY ANY TAPE RECORDERS!!!! Later!!!!
