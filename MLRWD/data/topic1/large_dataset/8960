Usually I am pretty critical of a movie depicting historical events when it tries to twist things and, in ways, change the view of history or give biased views, etc. As I believed there was "nothing on tv" as we all say, I just left my tv on as I started in on my Sodoku book. However, within minutes the book was down and I was following the movie. In conflict of my normal views on historically-based movies changing facts, I actually enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Someone obviously knew enough of not only the story of Jack the Ripper, but of the surroundings at the time. Weaving in the royal family, Scotland yard, thugs running amock, true events, and the secret society of the Free Masons, this turned out to be a very enjoyable movie. Historically knowing that The Ripper was never found or uncovered, I expected the ending to be the same but honestly was pleasantly surprised to see the ending in this movie. I am not much of a horror/mystery movie fan but this one is good enough that I plan on purchasing it now.
