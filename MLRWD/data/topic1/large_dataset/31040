The girl from "chocolate" (thai martial arts movie about an autistic girl that kicks ass) delivers another very enjoyable performance in this fast paced martial marvel. I am only writing a review because no one has reviewed this movie yet...I really don't have the talent for this sort of thing.

Basically if you enjoyed Ong Bak or Jackie Chan's Drunken Master you will definitely enjoy this. It doesn't have the greatest of plots or storyline, but it more than makes up for that with one dazzling move after another with a lot of good slap stick humor between. You will laugh and feel exhilarated while watching the movie. It is definitely worth at least renting. If this girl learns to speak english well, her acting and spectacular moves should land her plenty of roles in hollywood. If you've never enjoyed a martial arts movie then you won't enjoy this, but if you have ever enjoyed a martial arts movie then you will find Raging Phoenix to be one of the most enjoyable you have ever seen.
