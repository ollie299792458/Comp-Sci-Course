This is one of those movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C5LLLY">88 Minutes</a> which you come to with low expectations and then it even dashes those expectations. Granted, no one is claiming that the sperm was taken out of the prostitute and put into a dead girl across town in order to perpetrate an elaborate frame. On the other hand, no one is claiming that sperm is being taken out of a dead prostitute. That would have perked up the movie a little too much.

The first problem with the movie is timing of the release. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JL8F">The Sum of All Fears (Special Collector's Edition)</a> came out right after 9/11 and at the time the Russian policy towards the insurgency in Chechnya wasn't really on anyone's mind since the American policy towards the Taliban was the main debate. This movie comes along during the biggest crash since 1929 and the already hard sell of dashing accountants getting into the glitz and glamor of people who spend 15 hours at the office is impossible when those dashing financial analysts have just lost us all a ton of money.

But even without the bad timing, this is an atrocious piece of work. Hugh Jackman might as well be wearing a sign that says "I am the villain" the second he enters the frame. Ewan MacGregor does a fine job of playing an accountant who has had all vitality sucked out of him long ago. Unfortunately his character never gets that vitality back so we are caught between a mustache twirling Supervillain (not only can he plot against our hero but also read his mind to know almost everything he does) and a nebbish accountant who is just dead inside.

And Michelle Williams as the love interest is dull. When Natasha Hentridge and Charlotte Rampling are offering themselves up, I really can't see anyone falling for Michelle Williams (ok Heath did but he's dead from too many pills so what does that tell you?) She's just boring.

Note that I'm talking about the characters and the actors playing them. That's because the plot is so obvious and so inane that you see every major twist coming a mile away. When no one recognizes Hugh Jackman's character at the firm, only Ewan MacGregor doesn't find that strange. When the phones get switched and MacGregor is having great anonymous sex with gorgeous women who also work 15 hour days, he doesn't think to ask where everything is leading (of course, that's the gift horse in mouth syndrome but still) and once Hugh Jackman reveals his evil plan, it's kind of lame. And the last few twists where Ewan MacGregor is required to get a handle on the situation and turn the tables - not terribly believable either. Mostly because Ewan MacGregor is just the boring accountant from the beginning. I was so hoping for him to break into a Renton from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XALTG">Trainspotting - Director's Cut (Collector's Edition)</a> but I guess he's method acting when he's playing the accountant without vitality.

Nothing special. I've seen better from all of these actors (even Michelle Williams) and I can't even recommend the sex club scenes as anything other than perfuntory.
