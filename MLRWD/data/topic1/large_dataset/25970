A movie doesn't have to be "Schindler's List" to be good. Sometimes people forget that movies don't always have to take themselves so seriously. Yet, action flicks sometimes don't take themselves seriously  enough.
"Being John Malkovich" rises to the challenge to  produce a whimsical, utterly HILARIOUS story that is so outright absurd and  bizarre from the very start, most viewers will stop trying to make sense of  it after about five minutes into the film. It is then that the audience  just lays back, goes with the flow and HAS FUN! If you're someone who  always has to understand every detail and motive for every action in a  film, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU! 
But, if you can handle some silliness,  and really like to laugh, watch this movie. You won't be sorry. I was  almost crying from laughter in my seat. The whole audience was in an  uproar. Refreshing, zany, quality films like this don't show up often. So,  don't miss a chance to see "Being John Malkovich," just be sure  to check your cynicism at the door. :-)
