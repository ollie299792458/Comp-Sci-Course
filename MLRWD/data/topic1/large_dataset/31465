Tora! Tora! Tora is a very well-done movie about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. While some events are not historically correct, and some roles and events could have been expanded, the movie overall is very good.
The movie does a good job of portraying the events prior to the attack, although it sometimes leaves the timing of events to the imagination. Some events occuring in quick succession in the movie actually occured over a fairly long period of time.
The attack scenes were well-done and fairly accurate. The special effects were done quite well, considering the technology available at the time. I would have preferred to have seen more story lines about individual acts of heroism, of which there were many, but that should not be considered a criticism. 
Martin Balsam is superb in his role as Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, Commander of the Pacific Fleet. Jason Robards, Jr., comes off a little stuffy, but otherwise believeable, in his role as General Walter Short, commander of Army forces in Hawaii. James Whitmore deserves commendation for his role as Admiral William "Bull" Halsey.
Overall this is a very good movie and should be in the library of anyone with an interest in the attack.  But it should be remembered by everyone watching the film that it is a drama, not a documentary.
