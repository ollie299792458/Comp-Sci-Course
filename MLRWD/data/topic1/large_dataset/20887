THE 'PHANTOM' STAGE [# 28] STILL EXISTS on the lot - [it's a given condition] except now - and for years it has been fully covered.  Back then one side was left open - under an immense tarpaulin - for the long shots .......

GREAT DVD with the original release version and then a later restored and semi-colorized version - both contain the hand touched ball sequence.

WHAT ELSE CAN BE SAID?  This is possibly the definitive version - the later ones - the Raines and the Lom versions lack the special Chaney quality of Erik ..... immense danger yet compassion.

When watching the movie today - it very much becomes a grotesque ballet.  The performers are choreographed.

DVD contains numerous extras - including sound bites from a later version, interviews - especially interesting is the CARLA LAEMMLE [Uncle Carl's neice]who starred as the prima ballerina in "Phanton" - odd when we are shown stills from the dance sequence - a few dancers faces are mutilated - the photograph is specifically damaged ----wonder WHAT they sinned?

Chaney is the master of pantomime - using very small finger gestures in some of the scenes - to convey - it's very much a different style  ...

BUT the original 1925 print is dreadful - perhaps the FW MURNAU institute can take a look - they did brilliant work on Lange's recent "Metropolis" - however this present edition is something to cherish and protect!

Legacy!
