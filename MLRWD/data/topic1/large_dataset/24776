When I was about 19 I saw SOM in a real movie theater palace - one where you has reserved ticket seats. These theaters had upgraded their sound to handle the 6 track audio and expensive Todd-Ao projectors, screens and lenses. There were also beautiful and expensive programs booklets available in these palaces. The opening scene was breathtaking! When I watched the Blu-ray - it was like being there all over again. Your neighborhood theaters were showing it on a regular screen with mono and sometimes stereo sound. A few years ago I saw it at the American Film Institute - it was a terrible print - it was a painful viewing - I did notice that the younger generation was having a great time - and just loving every moment of the film. A young father and I began talking - I shared with him my experience - he was very interested in just how these masterpieces were shown in their prime. I still loved the AFI presentation in spite of its flaws which conflicted with my experience of 45 years ago!

This restoration is a real treat - it brings beautiful and rapturous memories!
