I have been using all of Jillian's DVD's for well over a year.. and nothing has changed my shape more then the 30 day Shred..so I was really excited to try this DVD.  I have Blast Fat Boost your Metabolism, No More Trouble Zones and her Yoga DVD and love all of them.. each one offers something different.

However, I'm really in love with this one though! I'm in decent shape (a high intermediate level) but started to get stagnent from doing the same routines. I don't have a kettlebell so I just used a 10 lb weight which is fine for now, but yes can be a bit awkward.  I did try level 1 and I just broke a sweat.. I was still a little sore in some places the next day.  So today I thought I would just try level 2 and would alternate between a 7 - 10 lb weight.  Let me tell you this was serious... I was definetly challenged and couldn't do some of the exercises.. or if I did, I would have to lower the weight OR use no weight at all!  In 15 minutes I was drenched.

I guess in my opinion, I would recommend you start with Level 2 if you feel your in decent shape and looking to punch up your work out maybe lose a few of those summer lbs :) and use muscles you haven't before.

I love Jillians no nonsense approach and she continues to motivate me no matter how many times I use her exercise DVD's~!  If you love Jillian.. def give this one a try!
