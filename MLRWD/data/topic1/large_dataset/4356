This movie is pitch perfect in depicting a ship in the British Navy during the Napoleonic wars.  It is an exciting blend of action, acting, design, music, and pinpoint depictions of very complex characters.

Even though most of the movie involves one ship chasing another halfway around the world, the movie never felt slow.  Every scene offered something compelling whether it was the interactions between Aubrey and the doctor, the subplot of the Jonah who is bringing bad luck to Lucky Jack's ship, how the crew responds to the death of a popular seaman, or realizing just how young the midshipmen (junior offices) were when they first went to sea.  The fact that these young boys were expected to lead grown men in battle was simply amazing.

I also loved how the movie highlights just how rare this kind seafaring was and how awestruck the crew could be at sights such as the Galapagos Islands.  The West was on the cusp of great discoveries and visits like the Surprise's to the islands symbolizes the rapid gains that would soon be made.  The doctor's excitement and then let down about being allowed to explore the islands is one of the most poignant aspects of the movie.

And then of course there are the battle scenes.  Any kind of warfare is awful and early 19th century naval warfare was particularly brutal with body parts being blown off by cannon fire, wood splinters skewering men, and musket fire raking the decks.  The Surprise is lucky to have a real doctor....most ships were stuck with barely educated saw bones who could do more harm than good.  The movie doesn't shy away from the violence of the times or the certain brutal joy that the men seemed to take on in combat.  Truly a different era.

I highly recommend all aspects of this movie.  It's simply a great piece of movie making.
