This movie was not bad , entertaining.

Rachel miner (from larry clark's Bully) goes on a road trip with her shrink to get her phobia of cars cured, but gets trapped in the woods in a BMW (niiice),. Then she has to face a screwy hitch-hiker in a hood, who doesn't talk much, and likes to eat bloody people-ka-bobs ?

oh, and he likes tormenting her.

The movie was very effective at showing penny's panic and fear, generally coming apart at the seams (hallucinations ?). This could've been a mixed bag, but I thought it was pretty fun to watch. In a way, I felt bad for her but I still enjoyed seeing her get it!

The only part i was confused by was when a couple was having sex in the woods and is killed, I wasn't sure how they got there.

The whole thing reminded me a little of 'Blair Witch project' but with a car stuck in woods, corpse, and a creepy hitchhiker, if that makes sense. the downside was it could have been slightly shorter. i also wish there was a wee more of horror icon, michael berryman. one of the cool perks was an elaborate title sequence.
