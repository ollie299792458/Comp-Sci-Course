I wasn't familiar with Ingmar Bergman until I watched this incredible, astonishing masterpiece of the 50's. Wild Strawberries tells the story of Isak Born (interpretated by Victor Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m, in a very memorable acting),long-time medical professor, who is about to receive a honorary recognition of his work from his former university. The story unfolds and focus more during his travel to the university, in which he turns to learn more about himself and his keening manners and thoughts, not to mention his remembrances and the people he meets, offering them a free ride for their destinations. He also has to deal with his son's ruined marriage, due to a unwelcome child.
Bergman gives a very humanist view here, discussing themes such as the human science against divine beliefs (God), death and loneliness, all together with some escaping irony and sarcasm.
Something I find pretty interesting to mention is that he everything he dreams, he consider them as "messages". Sigmund Freud once said that purpose of dreams are to notice situations or discomforts.

Despite interpretations, this movie is good as hell. Or as God. Or as human science
