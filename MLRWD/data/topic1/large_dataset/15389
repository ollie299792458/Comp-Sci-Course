This movie is very good at helping the average person understand the importance of the ritual of deer hunting in the UP of Michigan.  The movie depicts what hunting camp life is really like, including the stories, food, and conversations that take place with all seriousness directed toward how demeaning it can be when you don't get a deer during your hunt.  Jeff Daniels and the other actors could really be seen as the "people next door" in the woods of Northern Michigan.
  While the Bearwok and UFO scenes could have been deleted to keep the movie shorter and easier to understand, they were included in this movie because these topics always seem to come up during conversations at many areas of the North woods of Michigan.  Even the disregard and direspect for the Michigan DNR (Department of Natural Resources) officer is typical of any self-respecting Youper.  Although there is some language children should not repeat, overall this movie is very funny and a great family movie.  I would watch this again and again, especially during the fall huting seasons.
