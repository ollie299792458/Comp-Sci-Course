In 1988 i was watching a TV Show about hollywood and I heard the name "Pedro Almod&oacute;var" and they were talking about his movie "Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios". The movie was nominated for an Oscar as the best Foreing Movie,and I remember seen Lucia on top of the motorcicle and the wind was blowing on her face. Since that moment i knew that I have to see that movie. In 1993 opend the first Blockbuster Video in my home town and I went there asking for Almod&oacute;var's movies and they gave me five movies "Matador", "high heels", "Law of desire" and "Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown" i liked all of them but I got perplexed when I saw " the law of desire" because that was the first time that i saw to men together on a bed and i the same time the movie was very good. But when I saw "women on the verge of a nervious breakdown" i got facinated with Carmen Maura's (Pepa) performens it was extraordinary beautiful, funny, sad and at the end the movie got the right end. You must see this movie!
