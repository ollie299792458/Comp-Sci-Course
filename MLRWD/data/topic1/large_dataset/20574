I've seen many a great nature film, but this one goes straight into the next dimension! Only a few minutes into the film and I knew I was hooked! I was astonished at the way that Mr. Perrin was able to capture these birds, all backdropped by some of the most magnificent vistas seen! The film's realism was such that I was constantly trying to figure-out how Perrin did it! Was a small camera strapped to one bird from each flock, just before their migration? I felt somewhat stupified by the wonder of it, perhaps in the way that a chicken would look at a card trick. Imagine flying alongside these creatures as they go from place to place, getting "A REAL BIRDS-EYE VIEW"! I've never seen anything like it!
As great as it was, I didn't care much for the intro speak at the beginning of the film. Why it is that the "Lords of Most Nature Films" seem hell-bent on stating that the beginnings of life started some 400-million years ago is beyond me. At most, it's theoretical conjecture stated as fact.
