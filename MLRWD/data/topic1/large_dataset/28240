I thought this movie was absolutely charming.  It certainly make no pretenses at being anything other than it is, a charming, sometimes funny and touching way to pass a couple of hours.  It's true that about three of the plotlines could have been dispensed with completely, and it would have been a better, tighter movie.

But for me, this was made up for by absolutely superb, smart acting.  Neeson can do such amazingly delicate emotions for such a big, imposing man; Firth gives himself over deliciously to the absurdity of loving someone who can't understand his language; Thompson is heartbreaking as Rickman's wife, fearing his infidelity, yet stubbornly holding everything together; and however unlikely Hugh Grant seems as PM-- let's face it, he was a pretty unlikely book store owner, too--  he's become such a sly comic actor that it hardly matters-- he's just funny.

I don't see if anyone has mentioned the DVD extras-- the film commentary is done by Curtis, Bill Nighy, the young man who plays Neeson's stepson, and Hugh Grant-- and the highlight of that is certainly Grant's persistent ragging of Colin Firth.  Curtis eggs him on.  "What do you think of this actor?" he asks.  "VERY BAD,"  Grant intones solemnly. "Ohh, Gaaaawwd!" yawns Hugh as soon as Firth appears in another scene, "Now we're back to the boring bit."
