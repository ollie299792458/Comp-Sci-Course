This unfortunate yet inevitable film serves as a demonstrative example of a modern fairy tale romance.  Except that this one goes a step further, they fall madly in love before they even meet each other.

Sleepless in Seattle perpetuates the long held perceptions of love that Hollywood foists on the young men and women in our culture:

* Love is mystical, magical, wild, accidental, and you're powerless in it's grasp.

* Even when you're eyes first meet across a crowded room, you'll know if you've found the "one".

* You'll know when you fall in love when you have that smooshy feeling in your stomach, you lose all common sense, but you're in love, what else matters?

* Love finds you.  It's fate, and you've got to grab on when it comes or you may be left in the dust.

In the case of this movie, this fate also apparently drives people to break up with their fiance or partner because of insignificant idiosyncrasies.

These perceptions of love have distorted our perceptions of how romance "ought" to be, and changed our expectations in relationships and have let us down.

Even Meg Ryan admitted in an interview that this movie contributed to the Hollywood-ized fairytale perception of romance that so many young women have built their expectations on, and are often disappointed.  If there's anything this life has taught me about love, is that it's a decision.  It takes time, work, commitment, and will.  It is an act and a decision, not a force of nature of fate that you simply must relinquish your will to.

The cinematography is excellent, great casting too; But if you want a definitive Hanks/Ryan movie, get "Joe vs. the Volcano".  Deep plot, romantic, and pretty darn funny too.
