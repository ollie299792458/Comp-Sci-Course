I was a fan of the first, and enjoyed the second for what it was worth.  Now comes the third, and ultimately how many times can you tell this tale?  I am not interested in seeing what abstract and bizarre ways you can kill off 7 vapid teenagers.  There's a lot of "horror" flixs out there attempting to kill in the (sadly) most entertaining way.  What made the original Final Destination . . . well - original was the story surrounding it.  So, it has more than played its hand.

What intrigues about picking up this third installment on DVD is the "Choose Their Fate" special feature, which implies you have a chance to change the story.  I strongly advise if this is what is bringing you to this movie, you read the product descriptions carefully . . . you do not choose which characters live or die, or even which characters live or die for now.  The story you will see is essentially the same story ran in the theatres.  You simply change whether someone calls "heads" or "tails" to get the front seat on a roller coaster.  No matter which you choose, like life, the fate of the character is already predestined.
