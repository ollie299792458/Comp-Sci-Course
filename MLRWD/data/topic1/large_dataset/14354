Let me premise everything I am about to say by telling you that I am as "fanny" as a fan can get with this brilliant comic. Margaret Cho's "I'm The One That I Want" and "Notorious" are brilliant cum bordering on genius pieces that not only force you to the floor in laughter but also leave you thinking. A rare feet indeed in this day of mediocre comics that more often than not resort only to the mundane and profane to get a laugh.

As to Revolution: I don't know what happened with this venture. Margaret is simply not herself and I don't understand why the plug wasn't pulled on "Revolution" before it got the screen and DVD. It is not representative of Cho in any way, shape or form. Perhaps her dramatic weight loss so evident in this feature speaks to more than a loss of physical weight. Cho's babbling and ranting will have you reaching for the OFF button more than once. The only reason we didn't turn it off was because we remained hopeful that the glorious Cho of 'Ol would show herself eventually...she did not.

That it is not funny would seem bad enough. The real problem is that Cho doesn't have anything to say in this chapter. She has resorted to the absolute lowest rung of conversation in spending a good portion of this routine detailing her adventures in pooping her pants. It is that debase, it is that raunchy... it is not funny.

(...) Stay clear of "Revolution". If there was a "Revolution" Cho lost and unfortunately in buying this so did we.

Here is to hoping our Margaret is working on better things. Can't wait!
