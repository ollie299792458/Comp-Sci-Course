I saw this movie in the 70s and felt it taught us values.
That people need to be judged by who they are and what they do not by color.Today I see the same amount of dis respect given to to native americans. What we still are doing to make them less then us.they have many problems yet they were who where in this town long before any of us. They have so much to offer us in their rich past history if we only would listen.
I see no colors even if I am considered white our blood is red people all have good/not so good in them if we teach violence then expect it to be all around you.Then we ask why.
But at times if you do not stand up for what you beleive is right,we are judged as weak. you can't be bullied it is a fine line.
Even today this movie had good values to live by in the year 2001,the future is in the hands of the kids so we must teach our children love and respect. this movie has it all even a good laugh when my  19 year old son watched they part they talking about the new corvette that Billy Jack had driven into the lake it was $6000 new car, boy that dated the film and made my son get a good laugh out of this hippie film as he called it.
But he watched it more than once here at home so it is a good one for all ages
