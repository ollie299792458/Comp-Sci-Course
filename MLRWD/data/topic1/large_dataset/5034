Val Kilmer might as well be Jim Morrison reincarnate.  He was too good for the part.  It was beyond amazing... it was downright eerie.  From Jim's singing/talking voice, all the way to his maneurisms and his drug-addiction and his beliefs, and what he looked like... Val Kilmer got it all.  All I can say is, somehow,  JIM MORRISON WAS HAUNTING THIS FILM.

Because of that, and because of the incredible supporting cast, really hot women, and the splended choice of songs used for the movie, The Doors is an amazing masterpiece about an incredible rock group.  I wish I had been alive in that time to truly see the Doors live instead of being forced to see their concerts on TV and on DVD.

This DVD is an awesome bio-movie about the band, and about Jim Morrison.

And about Val Kilmer... I had first seen Val Kilmer act as Batman in Batman Forever, and after that, I didn't think too highly of his acting skills.  It was an okay Batman, but he just didn't do that good.  But then I saw this movie, and I began looking at what else Val Kilmer has done, and I realized, it wasn't Val Kilmer who sucked in Batman Forever (It was just his bad luck that he had to read that particular script)... it was Robin and the mediocrity of the movie itself.  As I said above, it was eerie watching him play Jim Morrison.

The DVD also has great features, a lot of Deleted Scenes that I think should be put back into the movie, and over-all is very worth-it.

Now, an unrated one with all those Deleted Scenes put back in would be incredible.
