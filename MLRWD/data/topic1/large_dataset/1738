Knight Rider is simply Michael Knight and a futuristic car that has its own personality and was named K.I.T.T. (short for Knight Industries Two Thousand). These two worked together in solving crimes with the aid of their mobile technical support on a jet black trailer recognizeable by this large horse logo (knight piece in chess). It enjoyed its popularity along with other shows like Blue Thunder and Airwolf in the mid 80's.

Later generations might not fully appreciate this show as those who were able to watch it in the 80's due to the rise of the computers and CGI's at this present age, but it's a good T.V. series nevertheless and deserves its DVD release.

Which girl wouldn't like a jet-black Pontiac Trans Am with this nice moving lights in front? Back then there was hype with cars (and even jeeps) customized with these nice lights. It might seem silly now, but isn't it great if you have a nice car that can be fully automated? Today, we might be able to say that it is very possible, but back then, it was mere fantasy and fiction, which made Knight Rider a very interesting show to watch.

The thing I liked best about it is the driver/car relationship may it be comedic or pseudo-dramatic at times. I think it's the very thing that made kids, teens and after-teens of the 80's glued to the show.

David Hasselhoff was a big plus to this show because he embodied the coolness of a guy who has this nice and superbly fast and flashy car.

The main attractions of the show? Of course, none other than the car stunts! And the people who made this really put a lot of effort and money to make these stunts.

To the fans, a must for collection. To those fans of baywatch, here's a chance for you to see David Hasselhoff when he was still young. And to the curious, just for the stunt scenes it's worth buying. Might even make you want to get yourself a pontiac trans am...
