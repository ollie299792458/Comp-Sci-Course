This is now one of my very favorite movies!!  The acting was wonderful and am especially fond of the actor Richard Armitage. His character in the movie seems particularly harsh but as the story envelops you see more and more the tenderness of his heart.  The movie very well portrayed the cultural differences between 19th century Northern and Southern England, between the different social classes, and that there are two sides to every situation.  It was packed with tension and passion and I fell in love with all the characters in the story.  Unlike many period piece dramas of the same time period they were not concerned as much with shallow and material things as they were about more significant things such as other people and overcoming poverty with hard honest work.  The author made the characters seem REAL still having their flaws but all the while still not being quite as silly and trivial as you will find in other such movies.  I definitely recommend this movie to all BBC period piece lovers and was very glad to find the movie Family friendly as well!!!
