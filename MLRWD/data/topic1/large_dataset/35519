Although for the modern viewer the abstract stage sets and frenetic overacting will take some getting used to, this film is well worth the trouble.  
Grandparent of all of the modern horror films (from the 1930's  Dracula and Frankenstien films up to modern works such as Halloween and  Spawn), this is the classic story of the Dark Outsider; here personified by  the Somnambulist Cesare and his evil master Caligari.  There is of course  the primal rape scene of the nightgown-clad woman menaced by the stealthy  killer, as well as the more baroque elements of Original Sin and Gypsy  Curses.  The ending will be a surprise to most who are not familiar with  the film, and begs a second viewing.  
Much of the dreamlike,  halucinatory photography is effective, as is the peformance by the actor  playing Cesare (uncredited in my copy). 
If you can suspend your  disbelief (and your urge to laugh at the campier moments) you will be  rewarded with some truly distubing images which you will not soon  forget.....
