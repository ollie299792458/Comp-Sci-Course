As a guy who's lived all his 45 years in North Carolina, I know this jewel of a film gets so much flack for absolutely no reason.  The criticisms are:  1-It's not a real war movie.  2-It sympathizes with southerners.  3-It's a chick flick.  4-It's a low-key drama.  5-It was filmed in Europe.  6-Foreigners play the two leads.  7-It's not 101 percent faithful to the great novel.  Look people, even if all of the above are true, this can still be a great film, and it is.

Zellwegger, for her endearing performance, so deserved her win as best supporting actress.  The film ought to have won in other categories in which it was nominated.  Kidman and Law are excellent.  Cold Mountain is such a realistic depiction of home life during the Civil War.  I've never seen a film as faithful to the original source material.  The characters are people alive with their fear of the war.  Guys will like the movie just as much as gals.  There is an epic battle to satisfy the war buffs.

The producers and director do a wonderful job of convincing us that Romanian locations are actually Carolina terrain.  If you want to experience what the Civil War was like for everyday people, this is it.  Treat yourself to this valuable slice-of-life re-creation.
