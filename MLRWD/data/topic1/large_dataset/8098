A friend told me that her guy friend wanted to leave in the middle of the movie because it was too scary.  I thought this would be good as I had not seen a scary movie in ages.
Final Destination again reinforces the fact  that many things in life are beyond our control.  Devon Sawa plays Alex,  the "psychic" who saves a handful of students and a teacher from  a plane disaster.  Labelled a freak and outcast because of his vision,  things do not get easier for him as one by one of the group of survivors  die.  A coroner told him that Death has a pattern and Alex is out to find  it and break it.
The movie got me paranoid after I stepped out of the  cinema, looking left and right, expecting a car to come at high speed at  myself in the carpark and on the roads.
When is it MY time?  Can I avoid  it?  How will it come?  These were some of the questions that waved at the  disturbed senses of my mind.  I was spooked for quite awhile, and even as I  write this.  Watch for a slight tinge of supernatural element and the  graphic scenes that may haunt you.
Acting wise, the cast is mediocre and  there are some unbelievable scenes, such as how does a bus come at high  speed at someone you're talking to right infront of you, without you  knowing and warning them?  Unreal.  
Trivial matters aside, an enjoyable  movie.  I'd hold Teddy close to watch this and be careful, don't spill that  drink.
