'Go' very nearly has it all.  It is the most successful blend I have ever seen of action and comedy, whisked along by a perfectly stylish soundtrack.
In a manner borrowed from Pulp Fiction, the film covers the  same few days' events from three points of view.  Each of these segments  oozes style.  The first, a drug deal gone hilariously wrong, sets a  frenetic pace.  The second, the ultimate night on the tiles, is my  favourite and with drinking, gambling, lap-dancing, gunfights and a car  chase to remember, that should't come as much of a surprise.  The third  sequence is truly bizarre, but also very funny, wrapping up the film in  style.
The pace never lets up, leaving so little time to think that the  comedy still surprises me every time I see it.  'Go' - An hilarious film  with moments of pure genius.
The only thing lacking, it seems, is a plot  in the 'classic' sense.  Lucky, then, that it boasts a script, cast,  direction and soundtrack so good you don't even notice.  And that is what  makes 'Go' a true triumph of filmmaking.
