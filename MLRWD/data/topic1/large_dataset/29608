This is one of those "lesser-known" George A. Romero films that I found to be one of the finest character studies to be put to film in a long time. It follows one of those traveling renaissance shows that uses  motorcycles instead of horses for their shows. What makes this film unique  though is how it carefully follows the main character or King William (Ed  Harris). Some viewers may find this film hard to follow at times,  especially if they're used to some of the directors other films (Night Of  The Living Dead, Dawn Of The Dead). We soon begin to feel for William and  the number of trials he and the rest of the traveling band have to go  through. Whether they're dealing with crooked cops, out of control bikers  or just themselves. In the long run though it becomes obvious that we're  dealing with a man who refuses to accept that he was born 500 years late.  If you love great stunts, this film has some of the best stuntwork ever  done using motorcycles.  Look for a strong performance from Tom Savini (F/X  artist for Dawn Of The Dead) as Morgan, The Black Knight, and a cameo from  Stephen King. Also starring Gary Lahti and Ken Hixon (Writer of Grandview  U.S.A.).
