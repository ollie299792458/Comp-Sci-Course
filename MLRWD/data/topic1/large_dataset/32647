I have always loved this movie, I really enjoy it , and I'll probably never stop enjoying it. I don't see why everyone hates it so much. The acting is awesome (despite the loss of Rachel Weisz), it has bravura set pieces, quotable dialog, great special effects, cool stunts, lots of clever humor and jokes and an amazing film score by Randy Edelman . Almost a perfect movie in every sense. It's a non-stop action packed adventure, and that is my favorite kind of movie. I enjoy the other films in the Mummy trilogy, but for some reason, this one has always been my favorite, regardless to what people say about it. My favorite scenes from the movie are the battle at the end, and the battle in the Himalayas. There both really cool, and have some really cool uses of special effects. I also loved when the emperor transformed in to various beasts / monsters (3 headed dragon, giant horned creature, etc.). Some of my favorite lines from the film were: "Welcome to the twentieth century!" and "Enough tricks! where's your honor? fight like a man!" I've watched this movie countless times growing up and it never fails to enthrall and entertain me.
