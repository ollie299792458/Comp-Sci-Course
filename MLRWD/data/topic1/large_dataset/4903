When the latest YA fad of The Hunger Games came strolling through the culture, more than one nerd read a plot summary, and, forehead creased, muttered, "What is this--Battle Royale?"

And, with a dramatic, acne-riddled flourish, the great barbarian hordes of the nerd kingdom raised their fists, babbling incoherant, adulterated Japanese.  Events like Comic Con and Dragon Con trembled with their tender, awkward rage.

I was at the frontlines of that unified moment of nerd rage, and I am happy to see this re-release of Battle Royale, even if it is clearly to try another dollar from the Young Adult section of the literary bankroll.

For the fledgling among you, Battle Royale is just a terrific watch.  Your cultural barometer doesn't have to go anywhere east for you to recognize this as a tense, horrifying thriller.  Beyond that, it does a great job of expressing the awkward, emotional strain of 9th graders, faced suddenly with certain death.  Their decisions--who to kiss, who to kill--shape them in our eyes.

Of course, the stand out performance here is that of Takeshi Kitano.  His twitchy, bizarre delivery haunts you, but also leaves room for sympathy, which is no small feat.  Sympathizing with a man who murders children is tough, even for those of us who have uncles just like that.

For return viewers, my recommendation is to purchase this edition.  Largely, for the translation.  While decent in earlier editions, by the end of the film (particularly the final three requiems), the translation becomes unbearably indecipherable.  This edition redelivers those lines poignantly and perfectly.

So it's worth the money, nerds.  Slap that cash down.
