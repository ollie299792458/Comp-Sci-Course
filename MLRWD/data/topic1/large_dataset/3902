I bought Paths of Glory because of so many 5 star recommendations. I'm adding another 5 star, because the movie is different, engaging and helps me see things in my life in a new way. The description of the leaders, and the bureaucracy of the military, is depicted in a way that i instantly recognize. These leaders are interested only in victory, victory that enhances their reputation and ladder climbing. They have little interest in the soldiers who die for the 'cause'.  Kubrick's screenplay is a work of beauty. Each scene describes the characters brilliantly, without the dialog.  There are multiple scenes of the leaders walking through the trenches. The hypocritical general walks away from the battle (quickly), while stopping occasionally to ask a soldier "Ready to kill some Germans?"  The general then asks a soldier "Do you have a wife?" The soldier says "Yes, and 2 children". The general replies "O well, i'm sure your mother is proud of you anyway". (Meaning, the general isn't listening to the response, he's just quacking pre-thought out statements).  He meets another soldier, "Ready to kill some Germans?" The man starts babbling, and another soldier says "He has shell shock sir." The general is instantly angry "Nonsense! There is no such thing as shell-shock" and slaps the soldier for his cowardice.
That's just the first 20 min. So much in this film.  Kirk Douglas is masterful, but Kubrick's artistry is really the star of this movie.
