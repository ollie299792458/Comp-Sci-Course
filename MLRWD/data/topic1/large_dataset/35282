Man! Talk about a giant missed opportunity. I'm not quite sure where this went wrong - but I guess I have to blame the director cause it is he who in the end has the reigns. The book by Alice Seebold was good, not fantastic, but a solid, well written little drama about coping with the loss of a child. The twist being that the murdered child looks on from her in-between heaven above. The strength of the book clearly lies in the strong characters, the human emotion and the genuine interaction betweeen the remaining family members. This is totally skipped in the movie. It is af if Peter Jackson chooses a few dramatic highlights and forgets everything in between. It seems horribly shallow and the poor actors Mark Wahlberg, Susan Sarandon and Rachel Weisz are left with almost "half-roles" - cause people will be wondering why the hell they're doing what they do. Now of course it could be that half the movie ended up on the cutting floor, but then again director Peter Jackson obviously has enough minutes to fill with an absolutely obnoxious cgi-heaven consisting of big pink roses, purple skies and stuff that looks like it would have fit better in a Narnia-movie. Jackson used to be really good at directing "smaller" things - think "Heavenly Creatures" and "The Frighteners". Now I just think he should stick to big productions with thousands of trolls. The two stars i give the movie is for the first 30 minutes of the movie which actually works and for actors Saoirse Ronan and Stanley Tucci.
