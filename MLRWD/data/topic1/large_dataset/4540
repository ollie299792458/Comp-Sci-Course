This is by far one of my favorite Audrey Hepburn movies.  In "Roman Holiday," Audrey plays a reluctant princess who escapes from her repressive royal life to have a one-day adventure in Rome... with Gregory Peck.  This is a classic 1950s fairy tale romantic comedy.
It's hard to believe that "Roman Holiday" was Audrey's first major film, because she's fabulous in it!  She has a certain grace and charm that is unequaled.  The Academy clearly agreed... Audrey won the Best Actress Oscar for her role as Princess Ann.
What most people don't know is that the script was an original creation by the famous screenwriter, Dalton Trumbo.  Trumbo had already been blacklisted for refusing to answer HUAC's questions regarding his possible Communist affiliations.  Trumbo was sentenced to a year in prison, and he spent his last few months of freedom working diligently on the "Roman Holiday" script.  He was able to sell the script (for much lower than his usual price) by putting a friend's name on it.  The money he earned from "Roman Holiday" took care of his family's needs while he was in jail.
"Roman Holiday" is a fun, family-friendly romantic comedy.  I highly recommend it!
