While it was silly to have another antichrist after Damian, this movie cannot be written off too lightly. There are scenes that convey the feeling of evil more powerfully than any of it's predecessors, reminding one of The Exorcist. I am referring especially to the scene where the detective is standing in front of a church where a chorus is singing Christmas carols. As he gazes at a Nativity scene, the figures suddenly become dark and scary looking while the infant Jesus looks like a dead burned baby (something like the baby of Damian's assistant in Omen III just before the baby's mother attacks his father with an iron). The chorus, meanwhile, turns into a creepy-looking chorus of gothed-out zombies singing some kind of satanic chant while one of them very slowly and deliberately turns the crucifix he is holding upside down. There is something very perverted and evil in this scene, far beyond special effects. 
I am one who is never scared at the movies. The only exception being The Exorcist. But this one scared me.
