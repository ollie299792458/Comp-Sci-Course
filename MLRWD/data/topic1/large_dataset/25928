I find that when people watch this movie, I've observed that there's no middle ground...
Either you have one side of the room laughing hysterically or the other side of the room
just sitting looking at the other side like they're nuts, wondering what's so funny!
I bought this DVD a year ago because my nephew (age 16 at the time) said that he and
his freinds found it hysterical. (I should've known!) (-;
In a year, I've watched it twice..so that tells you what side of the room that I'm on!
The only time that this DVD sees any play is if the nieces & nephews come to visit
and they always watch this in addition to others like Talledega Nights,
which is actually kinda funny to me. (-:
The bottomline is that if you have that silly kind of over-the-top humour, you'll love this!
If your humour has to have some basis in logic and must be relatable to real life experience
in some way, then you won't like this film. I appreciate John C. Reilly in certain things,
but in my book, this is just plain silliness!  It's a send up of all those music star biopics
like "Walk The Line" and others. So this one's on you to decide whether you'd
add it your collection or not.
