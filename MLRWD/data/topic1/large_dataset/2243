This is a great movie. The pacing and atmosphere are pure 70s. If you can dig on the 70s, then you will dig this movie. Love me sexy...ahh those were the days...

The soundtrack is great. The supporting cast is great, Andre 3000 and Woody Harrelson especially. I found it totally engrossing and hysterical. There is some serious raunchiness, but it all fits and doesn't seem awkward or forced. It reminded me of a great comedy from the 80s like Stripes or Caddyshack. Lots of laughs, funny characters, and bouncin' [...]... good times.

It also has a historical-epic quality to it. The basketball games are great. The cinematography and editing are masterful for a movie of this type.

 For me, this is Will Ferrells best offering since Anchorman, with Blades a close second.

 The majority of ADD tweenie-boppers probably won't have the patience for this raunchy comedy because it is for adults, yes, with adult attention spans who can appreciate a well-crafted film like this and "get" the jokes.

This is a great and funny movie. Two thumbs up!
