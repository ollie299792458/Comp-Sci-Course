I've seen this movie on TV and on VHS probably a total of 20 times. John Wayne just couldn't be better in his role as Ethan. Absolutely captivating.  No doubt this movie is about racism, obsession and revenge. Ethan just  hates Indians to the core of his bones especially when he sees two girls  driven insane but their captivity and the murder and rape of his niece.  
An interesting note. There is a deleted scene where Ethan goes up a pass  through some rocks to follow one of the indians. While the others continue  around and meet him on the other side. The movie cuts to Ethan coming out  of the pass wiping his knife in the dirt and out of breath. He's asked  where's his jacket. Ethan's response is "Never ask me about it".  I saw the original unedited version years ago before it was deleted. An  Indian has just raped and murdered his niece. He kills the Indian with his  knife and wraps the dead body of his niece in his jacket and buries her.  This must have been too much for the censor's to handle.
Anyone else  remember this scene?
