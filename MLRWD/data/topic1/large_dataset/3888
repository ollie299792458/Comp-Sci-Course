I surprised myself by liking this movie as much as I did.

I usually get pretty exhausted by overly familiar romances, and Wimbledon is about as familiar as they come.  You know the drill:  Boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back.  On top of this age-old plotline, Wimbledon stacks a whole series of cliches from the sports film genre, right down to the... well, I won't spoil the ending, but suffice it to say that you won't be terribly surprised when it happens.

Still, the two main characters are absolutely charming.  Lizzie Bradbury is a teenager who is taking the tennis world by storm.  Peter Colt is an older, fading star, the sort of player who makes you grimace when you see him on television because you can remember just how good he *used* to be.

It's not hard to imagine what they see in each other:  She gets a taste of his experience and his love for the game; he gains a little of her fire and enthusiasm.  An amusing subplot involving Peter's family spices up the story, but in the end, it's still one cliche right after another.

Still, cliches become cliches precisely because they work, and Wimbledon uses them to good effect.  It never challenged me as a viewer, but it never insulted me either, and I enjoyed myself throughout.
