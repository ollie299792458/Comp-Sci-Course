Going into this I was hoping to see some good old fashioned low budget B horror. When done right, a low budget film can be just a good as anything out there. Either they can turn out to be really solid well written works or be so bad that they are hilarious. This one was neither. It fell into that desperate middle spot where it wasn't anything except boring. I really couldn't even get any laughs out of it.

The main character is played by the attractive Cerina Vincent who is primarily known for horrific acting and showing off her um..expensive assests. She plays a park ranger who spends every waking moment hitting the bottle and staying depressed over her friends accidental death. While completely intoxicated she speaks with someone in her organization who informs her she will be on her own in the woods because they had to pull some of her back up. I could explain a little more of the story but I won't even bother. Bottom line is some creature starts tearing up people it finds throughout the woods and juggs with her terrible acting is the one who has to stop it. You barely get to see the creature and finally when you do you'll wish you didn't. It looked like a rip off of the creature in Jeepers Creepers only much cheaper.

I would say "It Waits" should wait on your list of films to watch. It has nothing to offer in the field of entertainment unless you are a big Cerina Vincent fan. Then you get to watch her run around in a nice white tank top a show while she is destined to be in these type films forever.
