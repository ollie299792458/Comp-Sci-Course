'Lone Wolf McQuade' on dvd! What can I say about my personal favorite Chuck Norris feature? Chuck Norris has always been criticized for his "wooden" acting performances in his movies, but 'Lone Wolf" should stand as a testimonial to Chuck's acting ability. In his previous vehicles, Chuck always portrayed the clean cut all-around good guy who had to be pushed beyond his limits before he took action; not so with 'Lone Wolf McQuade'. Chuck acquired a beard for the role of Texas Ranger J.J. McQuade, is often times dirty and sweating, he "cusses" and even drinks beer ('Pearl' as his beer of choice). But everyone knows the storyline by now, let's discuss the dvd version of 'Lone Wolf McQuade': 16:9 Widescreen 1.85:1 theatrical format, Dolby Digital sound, and Closed Captioning. Special Features: Original Theatrical Trailer, French and Spanish dubbing (Ever see Chuck Norris speaking French?), French &amp; Spanish language subtitles. The picture quality is impeccable. I think that MGM did an outstanding job with this dvd version of 'Lone Wolf McQuade' and was well worth the wait.
