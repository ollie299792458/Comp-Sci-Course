I rented this.  I feel sorry for the people that bought it.  This movie really really sucked.  Now, I could get into the house on an island with a bridge thats out most of the time because I would go for that sort of hermit lifestyle.  But the movie just kind of runs around itself in circles. It does it for so long before anything interesting happens that it gets boring.  I mean seriously how are you not going to notice the blond zombie standing in front of you looks and is dressed just like you!  The house was wonderfully creepy except for that perfectly painted white trim on the windows. And a house thats been abandoned for 40 years is not going to look like its been empty for 100.

We never got any sort of explanation for that long flooded tunnel the characters kept stumbling down into with the mysterious crying babies and screams coming from what seemed like endless darkness at the end.  I was really curious about that part.

The guy that drove her there never came back and we never found a body or anything.  The fact that she rowed across the river in a row boat and wandered through the woods to end up at the same house has soooooo been done before and in a much scarier way.

We finally reach a point in the end but only to have the stringy haired blond drive the truck off the bridge that she has been told is out throughout the entire movie.

My husband fell asleep during this and I was tempted just to give up and turn it off myself.  I had better things to do.  There wasn't a 0 star rating for this or I would have given it that.
