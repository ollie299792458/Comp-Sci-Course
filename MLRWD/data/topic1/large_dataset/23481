I saw this movie version only 4 months after finally seeing a professional stage production, though I've been an A.L.Webber devotee for years.  Compared to the stage show, I was somewhat dissappointed: The Coat itself  was more Amazing on stage and the brothers in ten gallon hats or berets  definately added to the parodies of musical genres in the stage show.  Donny O. lent more naivite to the Joseph role, though not enough angst to  "Close Every Door". The narrator did not add much except her  exagerated mugging. And why did they skimp on her costume; to show the  difference between skimpy Egyptians and dowdy school teachers? No wonder  there was no chemistry between them. I actually though it was a scream to  see a very well preserved Joan Collins cast in her usual  seductive/cradle-robbing role. It was subtle enough to go over the heads of  my pre-teen kids. I liked the device of starting off in the auditorium  which relates to the origins of the show, but I found it jarring to jump  back and forth in time which could have been saved for the end, just when  you almost forget where it started. Otherwise, the music makes it all  worthwhile, especially if you can't have orchestra seats. It would be fun  to see it on the big screen.
