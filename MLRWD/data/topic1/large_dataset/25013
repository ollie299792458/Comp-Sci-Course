Deep Rising has the terrorists and geography of Die Hard,the boat from Titanic, a few of the characters from Star Wars, the soldiers-vs.-monsters action of Aliens, a creature that resembles a mindless Lovecraftian Old One, a horribly gory almost-dead victim stolen from Robocop, and the classic sequence where the bad guy dies a slow, horrible death because he wasted his last bullet trying to kill the good guy.  Ah, the modern morality tale.  Plus a sense of humour which is really what keeps this movie going.  As you may have gathered, this is a formula movie, but it is done gracefully and never slows down or tries to be serious.  At the same time, it never mocks the traditions of the creature feature, treating every cliche and stock scene with exactly the right respect.  (Unlike, for example, Independence Day, which couldn't decide whether it was a major family feature or a B-movie, or the Mummy, which never made its nasties seem nasty enough).  The jokes are funny, the gore is plentiful enough to turn give seasoned stomaches a jolt, the action is well-framed, the music is creepy, and the ending is FABULOUS!!  However, it's not for everyone.  I've seen this a couple of times with mixed crowds, and I've found it to be one of those movies that will make your best friends look down on you forever - unless they are horror fans.  Don't say I didn't warn you.
