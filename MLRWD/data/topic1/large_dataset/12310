One aspect of this film not brought up is the fact that it is loosly based on the Bhagavad-Gita (refered to my many as "the Hindu New Testiment").  Anyone who has read this great masterpiece of literature should see this movie, if they have not already!
Will Smith's Character Bagger Vance reprsents Krishna, who is also called "Bhagavan"; Matt Damon plays Randall Juna ("R. Juna") who represents Krishna's friend Arjuna.  Instead of Arjuna's chariot driver, Bagger is Juna's caddy.  While this doesn't follow the story of the BG exactly, for those who know the story and the philosophy, both shine through in a beautiful and endearing way.  Juna has returned from WWI with a case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder(called Shell Shock back then) and refuses to pick up his clubs and play golf in a tournement held in his hometown (like Arjuna's refusal to fight at the opening of the Barata War).  Bagger tells Juna that "Inside each one of us is our one true authentic swing" and once, when someone asks him what is wrong with Juna, Bagger answers "The problem is, he still thinks he's Randall Juna!"  Hindu philosophy is peeking out of ever dark corner in this film.  It is truly a Gem, and I'm not usually a Will Smith or a Matt Damon fan...  
If you're a student of Indian religion or philosophy, you MUST see this film!
