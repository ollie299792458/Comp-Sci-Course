The people writing reviews here need to remember, we aren't reviewing the movie. We are reviewing the DVD.  We all know its a great movie.  In fact, most of us have already seen the movie at least once.  That sad fact here is that the dvd is a RIP OFF.

I agree with all the previous complaints.

1 Disc, as compared to most major budget kids movies being released with an entire extra disc of features.

Movie Previews, that they actually LOCK YOUR KEYPAD so you are forced to watch everytime you put the dvd in.  This I find SO insulting.  I paid good money for this dvd.  It shouldn't be like this.

The release of this dvd is even so cheap, there isn't even an INSERT inside the dvd case.  The total presentation of this DVD is so shoddy and pathetic.  I really wish I could take it back, but sadly most places I know have a firm policy that you cant return dvds, only trade them for the same title.  Sad. Because this DVD is a total rip off.

Buy this DVD ONLY if you *LOVE* this movie and can't possibly wait to see if a Special Edition or two disc set is released in a year.  Because if you are a true DVD collector, you *WILL* be dissapointed with this DVD.
