This is simply one of the best, most-intelligent, love stories I've seen.  Crudup and Connelly are amazing and amazingly beautiful.  Connelly brings so much emotion to the movie - all but the teenage boys will be crying.  This is a story about true love, the kind that changes you, the kind that becomes a part of you and exists even absent the other person.  But it's also about how hard it is to love a person without wanting to change that person into something they're not.  Also, what I really admire about this movie, is the obvious thought that went into the song selections.  They fit seamlessly with the movie, providing an almost operatic emotional effect.  The images and the music combine to produce some of those rare special moments a movie can bring.  This movie delivers emotionally, intellectually, and visually.  My one complaint with the DVD: the director's audio commentary.  Usually, this is the best bonus of any DVD, but Keith Gordon doesn't add much.  He just talks about what an inspiration his wife is, how amazing the actors are, and how he got cheated out of a screenwriting credit.  So, that's a bit of a disappointment.  But the deleted scenes are another story!  They make the DVD all the more a Must Have.  The scenes, some of them amazing (Ed Harris has a great one), really add to the story.  BUY this DVD; you won't be disappointed!
