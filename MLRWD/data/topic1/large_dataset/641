For fans of the series Dexter, this is a phenomenal show that is intense from scene one, dramatically compelling and overall highly addictive.  There have been many reviews I've read that state that the series is overly graphic, and I had to pause since it was my 83 year old mother who borrowed the discs from the library that recommended the show to me.  Although my first reaction was to agree with some of the reviews, upon further contemplation I feel it is much more accurate to say the series is emotionally intense.  There really aren't graphic scenes of torture and murder as you would associate with a movie like Seven or Silence of the Lambs.  It's the visual images of the crime scenes that conjure up in your own mind the graphic images of how gruesome the murder must have been.  This is a BBC series and, full disclosure, I am a huge fan of British TV such as Dr. Who, Torchwood, Foyle's War, My Family, The Robinsons, The Worst Week of My Life and the classic, Fawlty Towers, to name a few.  The series are much shorter than in the United States in terms of episodes, but they are well written, produced and acted.  I highly recommend you give Wire in the Blood a try.
