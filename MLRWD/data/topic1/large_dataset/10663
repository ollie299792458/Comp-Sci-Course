I've owned this film on VHS for 20 years, and know it like the back of my hand. So I couldn't help but notice that, on the DVD version, the soundtrack was of a slightly higher pitch than what I'm used to--probably because the DVD plays the film at a slightly higher speed.  This is quite noticeable the very start of the film, as the aria plays over the opening credits (compare this to how it's played over the DVD menu, where it's played correctly). This flaw is also noticeable in the voices of the women, particularly Maggie Smith's and Helena Bonham Carter's: Smith sounds slightly "chipmunk-y", and Bonham Carter's slightly deep, alluring voice is now somewhat reedy. There's also a slight "clip" in her delivery. I've read other reviews, and some have mentioned that the running time is about 3-5 minutes faster than what is usually listed.

The film itself however, is still as beautiful as I remember, and it's good to see Carter, Day-Lewis, and Sands in the roles that introduced me to them. I have yet to see the PBS remake, but I can't help but wonder as to the point of it--it's not as if this version was "horribly dated".
