Judging a ground-breaking television show that defined an era without actually having lived that era seems absurd to me.
Why? Because the 80s was a decade that broke ground in so many levels.  A distinctive decade to say the least.  With all its
good and its bad.  A different decade.  A decade like no other.

I have loved the show since its first episode for many reasons:  the plots, the acting, the writing, the directing, the music and
of course the clothes.  In other words, the true vibe of the 80s.  Since I was living in Miami at the time (Miami Beach actually),
I was able to live the vibe as it was.  I was there.  In fact, I would sometimes see some of the scenes being shot on location
as it was happening.  Furthermore, oftentimes I would see some members of the cast in the area when not actually shooting.
Even a couple of years after the show had ended I saw Phillip Michael Thomas sitting in his car waiting for someone to come
out of a local health food store.  I struck a conversation with him -- not precisely about Vice, and he was extremely polite and
nice.

The point is, the show reflected everything the decade was about, and everything that Miami was at the time, no more
and no less.  And that is what I call EPIC. I doubt there can ever be another show like Vice.  It made an impact not only in the
United States but all around the world where the series was shown --  to high ratings, incidentally.  That is what EPIC means
and that is what VICE was.  All five seasons.  Different. daring, smart, funny at times, dark at others and even at times somewhat
silly.  But, that is precisely what had the viewer coming back for more week after week: the unpredictability of it all.  That is what
makes VICE one of a kind.  The 80s was a decade like no other and VICE was in many levels, its perfect MIRROR.
