Tremors is my favorite movie. I have three or four copies of it and Tremors 2: Aftershocks laying around my house...

Unless they sent me a blank disc labeled "Plan 9 From Outer Space", I knew I was going to like it. And wasn't disappointed with this disk.

The quality of the transfer to BluRay was superb. It looked fantastic on the 32 in. HDTV I played it on at 1080p.

I do have a bone to pick with how Universal has designed their new 'menu' interface. It sucks, big time. And, on this DVD, they called "deleted scenes' 'Outtakes'. And the cover of the DVD says there is a 'Making of Tremors' documentary short on the DVD. I've seen the documentary, before, but I didn't see it on this film. Oh, and the interface is poorly designed, loud and somewhat counterintuitive.

Other than the interface, which, after all is said and done with, I can live with, this is a fantastic DVD, at a fantastic  price. I'd buy a copy for a friend/family member in a heartbeat... lol
