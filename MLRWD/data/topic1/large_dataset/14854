This movie is spectacular.  I can't imagine a more beautifully crafted movie.  The pastel stereotype Suburbia is so interesting, the characters are complete stereotypes and yet they are all unique.  All of them immediately accept Edward and don't seem phased by his deformity.  Kim is the only one who really reacts to him.  I expected the classic beauty and the beast story but it seemed completely opposite.  The visual aspects and the music blend together perfectly, I think this is Tim Burton's best film (and also probably my favorite Depp movie as well, though I've seen Benny &amp; Joon a thousand times and love it to death so it's hard to tell).  I really don't think any movie can match the music of the Nightmare Before Christmas on Danny Elfman's part, but this comes close, especially for a less muscial movie.

Overall, this movie is magical.  It's something you can watch again and again.  The characters are interesting and Depp's performance is beautiful.  One thing to keep in mind if you haven't seen it is tha this is not a dark movie.  From the box and what I'd heard I expected something darker, but while it is sad I wouldn't classify it as a dark movie.
