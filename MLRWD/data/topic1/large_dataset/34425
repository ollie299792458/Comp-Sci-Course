With 'The Straight Story' David Lynch has weaved together a subtle, fascinating story about age, regret, and family.  The tale is of Alvin Straight, a 73 year old man who has seen most of what life has to dish out  and learns that his brother suffered a stroke.  With bad eyes and no  license, he sets out on a journey on a riding lawnmower to see his brother,  who he hasn't spoken to in ten years.
What I loved most about this movie  is the simplicity; of the story, the characters, the filming.  Yet within  that classic style is a movie that is incredibly moving.  The stories that  Alvin has to tell about his life are saddening, touching, and almost  frightening.  He talks about being old, about fighting in World War II, and  about his regrets of not speaking to his brother.  He runs into quite a few  people along the way who help him out, and their stories contribute to a  beautifully crafted script.  
Richard Farnsworth is convincing in the  role of Alvin.  His abilities are most especially outlined in the sad tone  of his voice, and the look of regret and hope in his eyes.  It is rare that  I have grown to respect and adore a character so much.  David Lynch's  direction is not dark or creepy like his other works, but carefully and  nicely photographed in great harmony with the script.  The cinematography  is smoothe, and the extended takes prove his abilities as a director and  the actors abilities as well.
This film is done in a classic manner, and  the results are moving in a rare way.  I sincerely hopes this film  eventually gets the recognition it deserves.
