The film itself consists of many single-shot pieces telling a story about art, who sets the standards of art, and what it means to create a work for people instead of "collectors."  There are excellent scenes  depicting (on radio and in person) appearances before Dies  "un-American activities" committee.  The creative process is  depicted as a sort of hallucinatory reality both of the playwright and the  play itself.  Bill Murray's character portrays the notion of theatre as the  artist speaking through and for others, a main theme of the film  symbolically underscored by the portrayal of artist Diego Garcia and the  beautiful but "too controversial" mural commissioned for the  Rockefeller plaza, which is physically destroyed just as the play  "Cradle Will Rock" is performed with its verboten ideology of  people joining together to effect change through unionism and solidarity.  The cynicism of the wealthy elite chatting about determining the future  direction of modern art through selective patronism should be seen not as a  charicature but as a prediction of the future as demonstrated by the final  shot of the film (and illuminated brilliantly by the German artist Hans  Haacke).
