Elite Euro horror actor Giovanni Lombardo Radice stars in this film based around third world savages. The soundtrack is great, only adding to the threat of filmed in a third world country. A group of college students ventor into a remote jungle to investigate rumors of cannibalism. I don't mean Jeffrey Dahmer- I mean savages; they were depicted as savages because they're not white. This film's obvious racism is masked by the cannibal's torture of the cast. They run into two gangsters who were looking for diamonds and cocaine, only to run into the savages who castrate and eat their genitals. Only the character played by Lorraine DeSalle survives at the end. One of the scariest films ever made. In the year 2010, there are still some people living in the stone ages and practicing cannibalism. From the bizarre opening sequence, the terror never lets up. The disturbing aspect is not only real life torture of animals on screen, but the shots of New York and the third world jungle location. But Radice has admitted he over acted in it, which again only adds to the fear. So scary it's a must see.
