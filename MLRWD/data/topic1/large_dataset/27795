Saw is a series that never stops trying to tell an intriguing story. every year, i'm fearful that this Halloween, i'm gonna head to the movie theatre and spend an hour and a half watching people mindlessly chop themselves up, which has never been what Saw is about. to date, each successive year has surprised me with a film that, while not necessarily as good as its predecessors, continues to develop the series on every front and is still every bit as much about bringing the viewer into its universe as the first was. i have no knowledge of any series of films to maintain integrity for so many installments.

that's not at all to say that implausibilities haven't been increasing in frequency. particularly unlikely is this films iconic pendulum trap, which requires you basically not think about it at all in order for it to make any sense. it's primarily fanservice, but what the hell, it's good fanservice. i'll openly admit to this film being a distinct step down in overall quality, only slightly better than Saw 2, but it's still a good film and a necessary addition to the storyline. however, the ending has me more worried about the next installment than any of the previous installments. it is entirely possible that this years Saw will be the first to border on near-pointlessness, but at this point, i'd be pretty happy to just go see a gorefest set in the Saw universe. i might not buy it on DVD, but nothing could keep me out of that theatre.
