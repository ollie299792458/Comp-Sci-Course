I have been having a wonderful time with the DVD version of Fosse. I saw it performed on Broadway, and enjoyed it greatly, but I love the DVD version even more. Seeing the entire production from beginning to end can be a little overwhelming. It's like overdosing on Fosse. When you see a play he choreographed, like Chicago, or Pippin, then you have those amazing dance numbers intersperced inside the book and songs. In the theater, an evening of all-Fosse-dance-numbers was like being a child at loose in a candystore. It's all delicious, but you end up with a stomach  ache. On DVD you get to select the dances you want to see, and watch however much you want at a time, and it is absolutely wonderful. I never watch the whole thing, but there are sections I watched every morning upon awakening to give me a push to get on with the day. For this reason definitely buy the DVD version and not the VHS version. Also, in order to have it preserve itself for a long while. You'll want to watch this in another 50 years or pass it down to your children. I think that the camera was beautifully directed to really gives you a feeling of each number, and the dancers are absolutely superb. Ben Vereen is getting old and can't dance the way he used to, but it's a delight to have him around anyway, and thrilling to hear him sing again. The young dancers are astonishingly good. If you want to know what is amazing about Broadway dance, then buy this DVD.
