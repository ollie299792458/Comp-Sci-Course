You'd think that after a bare bones edition release several years ago this 'Special Edition' would be a definite upgrade.

Bar the 2nd Disc which makes it a good Special Edition extras wise this package suffers:-

The DVD picture is marred with film dirt, specs, blemishes and is as grainy in scenes.  TBH it's like watching a Pirate copy.

Put this on my 84" Projector after watching 2 Indiana Jones movies also 'Paramount' 2003 released titles and boy the difference was day and night.

The Indiana Jones movies were the next best thing to High Definition until we actually get HD DVD releases or Blu Ray.

Why they couldn't give their much loved Star Trek franchise this treatment I don't know.

Star Trek V suffers from the same problem picture wise and also isn't framed correctly.  2, 3 and 6 are acceptable.  I don't know about 1 as I never liked that one and give it a miss.

In a nutshell be careful if you're to fork out on a whole set either bundled or seperately of these current Star Trek Movie Special Editions as they are. You may even be double dipping for the 2nd S.E. disc hoping that the Feature itself has a Picture and Audio boost.

I've just bought 2,3,4,5 and 6 and I'm raging at the lacklustre Picture quality on the whole.

Shame on you Paramount for being lazy and providing low quality DVD for such a high quality franchise.

Get your finger out and upgrade these now both new SD and HD releases should be forthcoming soon IMHO and long over due!!
