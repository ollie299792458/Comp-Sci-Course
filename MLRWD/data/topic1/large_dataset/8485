Some may say that The Virgin Springs meet A Clockwork Orange may not be the best way to describe Mark L Lester's Class of 1984.I am okay with that.This film is Prophetic in more ways than one.In the 80's Revenge films reached their height with films like Mad Max and Death Wish 2.Welcome to the enemy of bullys and Gangs.This vision of Gangs and total anarchy by itself created a unigue perspective of society and the way that students and psycopaths can appear innocent yet harbour a bloodlust unlike anything ever seen before in movie history cinema.The symbolism presented here may not reach all viewers but its remindful of Blackboard Jungle and other films of this genre.That being said,Class of 1984 is Raw,violent,and upsetting and at the same time,Compassionate,Funny and understood when it comes to the fact that if someone is pushed to the breaking point they will stand and fight back in an even more vicious way.This film is the epitome of revenge movies.Accolades to the cast, crew, and especially the screenwriters for being suave enough to bring this to the silver screen.I ordered this along with Class of 1999,another great Mark L Lester film.The quality,Extras,and Interviews place one in a nightmarish landscape of the evil people can do.A cat and mouse mentality that escalates and will have you rooting for the good guy and booing the Bad.I got this in just a few days after ordering it.Once again Amazon and the seller-Greggory W Thomas-have delivered a hard-hitting show to my dvd library.When we think of violence like the sort that happened at columbine and other high schools today we can have an idea and maybe more appreciation of Bullying and Gangs that run rampant thru todays high school.If you dig this mini-thriller than try the loose sequel,Class of 1999.5/5.And watch out for Micheal Fox/Micheal J. Fox in a role far removed from the Back to the Future Films.A must have for DVD collectors.
