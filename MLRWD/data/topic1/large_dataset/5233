I used to love the A-team 20 years ago when it was on prime time, I loved it when it was syndicated, and I love it on DVD now.  I watched the whole season one by one every couple days and did not stop smiling for hours after it was over.  The squabs between BA and Murdoch are more hilarious now than they were ever.  That theme music gets stuck in your head and you feel like you can do anything.  Seriously, what is more American than being a war hero, being shafted by the government, running from the law, helping out people who cant help themselves, tricking hot babes into giving you stuff to beat the bad guys, beating the bad guys, and looking good doing it?  Why aren't there TV shows like this anymore?  No stunts, no thought is required, no simple humor.  A show like this is timelessly entertaining.  Every episode is the same premise:  Hannibal is in a costume trying to find out if the person they may help is legit, they bust Murdoch out of the VA hospital, Hanibal tricks BA into flying against his will, Hannibal gets under the skin of the bad guy as if he were kicking a sleeping bear, the bad guy retaliates, the A-team does or doesnt get caught, Face tricks a babe into giving him something, and the plan comes together.  Its the same show but not the same show over and over and it is really a no fail surefire way to be entertained.
