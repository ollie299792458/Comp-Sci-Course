I've already reviewed this item before, so I won't bother to repeat myself. I wanted to add some additional details as to why I bought this movie on DVD vs VHS.
First off, I have a brand new laptop w/ DVD player. So, I wanted to pick up some of my favorite movies so I could watch them during lunch at school.
Second, the picture quality isn't THAT bad. It's reasonable for an eleven year old film, recorded without the aid of any digital technology, then being transfered to a DVD. (Sort of like when you record a CD to casette tape- you lose a lot of the sound quality and pick up background noise)Besides that, I'm sure that the junk in the picture is on the VHS, too, only you can't see it because tapes offer a much lower video quality.
Finally, I bought this movie on DVD because video discs don't degrade with age. As a VHS tape is watched heavily, the picture quality worsens. Eventually, you would have to buy a new VHS. I don't know what the difference in cost between the DVD and tape is, but it can't be that much.
If you like this movie, pick up the DVD. It's worth it.
