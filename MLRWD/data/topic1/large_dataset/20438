If you have any love for music at all, you'll enjoy this movie.  There's a language that goes along with music...it makes the sounds that the soul wants to speak but can't find words for.  It sings of celebration, joy, hurt, anguish...and other depths of emotion that we can't even begin to explain.  This movie does a wonderful job of expressing that.

As a musician, I actually ached inside watching it because I understood what August heard in the world.  His musical pureness was exquisite.  He didn't understand the capitalist edge he had that Wizard tried to exploit because of his gift.  He didn't understand the importance and grandeur of his accomplishment at Juliard.  He simply heard the music and knew in his heart that it would serve him good in mending the broken relationships of his life.  That is the essence of music...touching the areas of life that otherwise would not be reached.

If you watch this movie with just your eyes, you may not be as delighted with it.  But watch it with your heart and you won't be able to help but stand and cheer!
