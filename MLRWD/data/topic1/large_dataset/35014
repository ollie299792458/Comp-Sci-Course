Some Summer movie fans thought that this film wouldn't come close to being a blockbuster like The Dark Knight.Well let me say that The Dark Knight was a confusing mess and this time DC Comics really dropped the ball.Iron Man was very well done.It stayed true to the origin story of why Tony Stark became Iron Man somewhat.In the comics he escaped out of Vietnam as a POW,in this adaptation it was in the Middle East. But that's a good thing because this film is set in the present time and it all makes sense in our world today. It is also a commentary that a man can change his ways and make a difference in the world. Faverau really avoided the fact that Tony was an alcoholic and was a greedy prick in most cases.The director did show Tony partying alot and drinking here and there.Iron Man is a great companion film to Incredible Hulk.It is best to watch Iron Man first and then Hulk because at the end of The Hulk Tony shows up and makes a comment eluding to the Avengers.In one scene you can see Captain America's shield in Tony's workshop.Jeff Bridges is in great shape for his age and plays the ultimate villain,a backstabber! Marvel is giving DC it's money's worth and is bringing the heat.Just a side comment if I may,but late 2008 and 2009's flicks are going to be awesome. Here's the lineup so far.Punisher:War Zone,Watchmen,GIJOE,Transformers 2:Revenge Of The Fallen,Wolverine,Terminator:Salvation and Superman:Man Of Steel.Marvel and DC have been at it for years over the summer box office.And that's okay because the fans are the real winners.So when you get Iron Man make sure you pre-order Hulk.And if your'e a comics nut like I am,you should get Dark Knight just for the hell of it,just because you'll be owning Heath Ledger's last complete role on film.
