"What do you want to be when you grow up?"
I'm sure most of us have been asked this question at some point. And some of us, in our infinite wit, replied that we weren't planning on growing up, thank you very much. But how many of us meant that?

It looks like Pee Wee Herman did. Part insanity, part compassion, and all exuberance, he combines the wants of a child with the ability to actually get these things that adults possess. A breakfast-making machine built out of everything under the sun, a basement for holding secret meetings, and an absurdly wonderful bike, among others. But one day that bike of his disappears, and Pee Wee sets out on a wild goose-chase to get it back.

When this was shown in my high-school class, some of the kids found certain parts awkward - such as Pee Wee rolling around with Francis, with the spoiled child in the nude - but the creepiness in such scenes just melts when you realize that Pee Wee Herman is not an adult. He is a child, as much of one as we ever were, and he has managed to retain the innocence that many of us lost.

(As a bonus, you get some neat commentary from the directors and the music to boot. How's that for a good deal?)
