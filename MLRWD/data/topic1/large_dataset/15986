The whimsical spirit of the classic TV series is retained in this unbelievably poorly treated adventure film. The studio hacked away about a half-hour's worth of footage after a bad test screening, meaning some may find the plot hard to follow, but all the stuff you need to know is there if you pay attention. Basically, it's the traditional spy story- our heroes battle a diabolical madman with an elaborate scheme for world domination- overlaid with some of the most imaginative, inventive and downright charming imagery seen in any action film. You've got gun-toting grannies, killer teddy bears, robotic bees, Escheresque mazes and all other kinds of hallucinogenic imagery, as suave superagents John Steed and Emma Peel try to foil Sir August De Wynter's plot to control the world's weather. Throw in a Mrs. Peel clone and a traitor in the agents' midst, and you've got a dreamlike narrative that proceeds to a wonderfully tempestuous climax. Fiennes and Thurman are no Macnee and Rigg, but they've got their own appeal and a nicely tender chemistry. Sean Connery as the bad guy appropriately hams it up, and there's a superb supporting cast. The visuals are wonderful (avoiding the phoniness of some attempted camp-fests like BATMAN AND ROBIN), the characters fun, and the overall effect is quite exhilirating. Highly recommended.
