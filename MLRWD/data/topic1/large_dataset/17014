I can't really say for sure if I like this movie for the memories it brings back, or if I just like the movie, probably both. I think this movie has a lot in comman with Halloween, in a good way. First off, it has some great jolts in it, the first one of which I thought was really smart because if you had seen this movie in a theater as I did as a kid, you wouldn't have leaned back in your chair the whole movie. Also the use of a popular 70s campfire ghost story (highschool boys ring tapping on the window of the car) was a nice touch as well. The other thing it has in comman with Halloween is how straight up 70s the people in the film are and how you almost know them all at first introduction. You really get to know the people in the film (before they are stabbed to death :-) which is something the new films don't even try anymore. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think the killing scenes could have used a bit more gore. If you are a fan of the 70s give this one a shot. It'll take you back with a bit of a fright along the way.
