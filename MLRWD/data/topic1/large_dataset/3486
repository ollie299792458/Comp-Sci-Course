Before Twilight, Buffy or Moonlight there was Forever Knight.The cult CBS program  tells the story of homicide detective and vampire Nick Knight and his struggle to become human. The new season improves on the stories and style of season one by developing the relationship between Nick and Coroner Natalie. Other characters from the first season are still around like Lacroix (Nick's vampire dad)who becomes a recurring character in season two. Nick must face him and the uneasy relationship of a Vampire trying to become humans with Vampires like Lacroix and the beautiful night club owner Jannette who have no intention of changing their ways.

Highlights of the season include where Shanke discovers the truth about Nick and the two episodes directed by Geraint Wyn Davies(Nick Knight) and the episode directed by John Kapelos (Donald Schanke).

Season two will delight and impress viewers that enjoyed the first season but dislike the added sex and violence that over saturate season three.
