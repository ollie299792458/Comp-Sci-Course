What a great movie! Touching, witty and well-acted. Based on a true story, Calendar Girls is the story of a group of members from a somewhat starch-collared dried-up women's fellowship club deciding to raise money to buy a comfy couch for the relatives room at the local hospital (where one of the club members husbands recently died from leukemia). Rest of the review is in the extended entry.

In previous years, they had done calendars with pictures of cakes, jams, flowers, etc - those calendars netted less than 100 pounds profit. They needed to do something different this year. Something that would make some money.

They are inspired by the dying husbands speech he had written to give at a future club meeting:

:::: "The flowers of Yorkshire are like the women of Yorkshire. Every stage of their growth has its own beauty, but the last phase is always the most glorious ... Then very quickly they all go to seed." ::::

One of the women comes up with the idea of doing an arty-nude calendar - the catch being that all the women are in their later years and all their "bits" are covered with buns, watering cans, knitting needles, or their choir books.

The ensuing story is hilarious as the husbands find out what their wives are up to, the photographer is chosen, the actual photo-shoot takes place (who could forget ... "We're going to need considerably bigger buns"!), one of the women's children getting caught smoking a joint (of oregano!), and of course when the media finds out - it gets crazy!

We see the women blossom ... friendships are strengthened ... and LOTS of money is raised for leukemia research (approximately 1 million American dollars) and of course for the new couch in the hospital waiting room.

It's a feel good movie - it will have you laughing, crying and thinking about whats really important in life! It gets a rating of 5 stars!!
