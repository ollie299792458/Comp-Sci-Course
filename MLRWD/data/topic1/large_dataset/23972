*phew* what a movie!!! THE GREEN MILE surpassed any of my expectations on a screenplay based on Stephen King's novel. Surely after I watched PET SEMETARY I was scared out of my wits to watch ANY movies written by S. King again. But as soon as I heard about the hype regarding T.G.M, I finally gave myself a try. And boy, this was a story I shall never forget.
Sure, I'm pretty positive that many of you have already seen the movie, or have at least an idea of the plot. Tom Hanks plays a prison guard at Cold Mountain Penitentiary, the deadliest and pretty much the scariest place of all. But what makes Tom Hanks' character truly shine is that he has a heart of gold. John Coffey (played by Michael Duncan) is the biggest, strongest, but the gentlest prisoner brought in. He was accused of killing two little girls, and in that time period (the 1930's) racism was a strong quandary. So without much investigation, John Coffey was automatically accused. He WAS seen with the two little girls on his lap, but that was for a different reason, that only you have to watch the movie to truly understand. Many events occur, some intense, some happy, and some extremely depressing and/or heartbreaking. In midst of all that, Tom Hank's bladder problem is healed, prisoners are executed, and John Coffey becomes friends with many of the prison guards, and even raises a little mouse. In the end, things are not going as the watcher wants it to, but one of the most endearing quotes is when Tom Hank's speaks, "what I am going to say on my judgment day..." Of course stated in better terms, but I found that to be the part I started bawling out. 
I am not a movie critic, but a normal teenager who was just fascinated by The Green Mile and had to share some of my thoughts.
