Mobile Battleship Nadesico is the last hope for mankind.  The war in space has lead to Earth being surrounded by the Aliens...the last hope is for the mightest space battleship, Nadesico, to break free and take the fight to  the enemies.  Nadesico has the most powerful weapons, backed by an array of  giant fighting mecha.  Crewed by the most brilliant captain (?) and brave  crew, the Nadesico is Earth's last chance.
Nadesico is one of the best  anime series I had the chance to view.  I was fortunate to see the first 12  episodes at a con, and I was hooked after the first episode.  This series  has it all for the anime fans.  Giant robots, big spaceship battles,  amazing technology, great lines, fantastic comedy, cute anime babes ^_^ ,  but it also does a fantastic job of surprising you with the way it will  depart from other anime series.  Even making fun of stereotypical anime in  its portrayl of two characters obsession with the anime show Geikganger (an  anime series we see in Nadesico).  ^_^
