I saw this film when it came out and fell in love with it. When the VHS edition came out a few years later I watched it thinking "something is not quite right here, if my memory serves me well..."  And I was right. Many of the songs from the original film were removed ( for copyright and financial reasons, I am to assume ) and some of the dialogue was missing and/or changed. My friends kept telling me I was crazy. But I KNEW I remembered hearing David Bowie's "Young Americans" playing during the scene when the family is getting into their cars to go to the wedding near the end of the movie. That, and the song playing during the opening credits ( "Kajagoogoo" by the band of the same name) was changed. Several others spring to mind, but the point to this aimless rambling is to let the potential buyer know that this is the ORIGINAL uncut version of John Hughes' classic Eighties romance, complete with all the original songs. This is a classic. Incredibly funny. And loaded with roles featuring future stars ( both the Cusacks, John and Joan, as well as a young Jamie Gertz).
