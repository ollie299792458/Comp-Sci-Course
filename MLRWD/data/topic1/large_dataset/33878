First the Good:

I am a teacher and my students complain every year that the "Ponyboy gets jumped" scene is not in the original.  I thought the extra footage in the beginning really helped a lot.  It stayed much closer to the book, but with anything the book is always better.  Read it.  I really liked the character development.  The original movie stands well enough on its own, but if you hadn't read the book there are definite gaps.

The Bad:

The new soundtrack is awful.  I am no Stevie Wonder fanatic, but this retro 60s music did NOT fit the mood in many places.  It was so distracting that I almost turned it off.  (hence my 3 stars and really thought about 2 stars)

With all the extras I would have liked to see a flash back of Johnny getting beat up and more "bonding" time between Cherry and Ponyboy while they were in line.  The book develops this so much better.

I also did not like Ponyboy and Cherry meeting up at the end and she ignores him.  The book leaves that much more open ended and in fact implies that Cherry and Ponyboy are the true "Outsiders" because they can see "outside the box" of their respective gangs.  Randy and Johnny also fit into that category.

I have never liked the Dally death scene in the movie.  In the book it was more suicidal and he was in control of his own death and the movie makes him out to be a victim.

All in all I wish they would have alternate sound tracks so I could play the original score, or they could have just hired someone to write a new score.  The movie and book have sold enough copies that they should have gotten in right.

I plan on showing the old version to my students or possibly show the first 20 min of this one and then pop in the old one.
