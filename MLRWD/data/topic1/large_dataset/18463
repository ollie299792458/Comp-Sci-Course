I notice that a lot of the 1-star reviews this film has had are written by people who have an utterly bizarre and in many cases outrageously stupid idea of what they were getting into, proof I suppose that being a fan even of a writer as great as Jane Austen doesn't always make people more wise, tolerant or understanding.

I watched this expecting it to be a chick-flick, and it is one, but it's a reminder of why chick-flicks are a good idea; because they're about people and human relationships, and not about who knows what and who's talking to who.  Austen fans will have great fun spotting which of the characters are riffing off which Austen characters (my wife and I were totally convinced that the Emily Blunt character Prudie and the Maggie Grace character Allegra were basically re-enacting Pride and Prejudice - boy, were we wrong) and those who have never read Jane Austen...well, I can only assume that this would turn you onto her, the way Babette's Feast turned an entire generation of film-lovers onto French cuisine.

It's nice to see British actors demonstrating that they can do great American character acting as good as any American actor - kudos to Emily Blunt, Hugh Dancy and Lynn Redgrave.  My favourite actor in the whole thing is Maria Bello, fabulous as what you might call the 'Emma' character, a woman so used to being single that she's forgotten how to be normal around anyone but her friends.  There's a sublime moment early on, in an elevator, where her dog-breeding single woman character suddenly notices an adornment on a passing Goth girl, and comments on it...classic.

It's a generous, intelligent, grown-up rom-com.  Expect nothing more or less.  And reflect on how hard that is to achieve.  It's certainly more intelligent than Richard Curtis' most recent output.
