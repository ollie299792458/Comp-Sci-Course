This Cirque Du Soleil show, in which is about a journey seen through the eyes young girl, is amazing. It is one of my favorite cirque shows. The acts included in this dvd are, jump rope, ariel contortion in silk, diabolos, banquine, vice versa (statue), *****hand balencing, ariel hoops, german wheel, ariel ropes, and many more. My absolute favorite act is hand balencing on canes. It is performed by Olga Pikhienko, the same acrobat who does hand balencing in cirques latest production Varekai. This act is truly breath taking. The flexibility, stength and balence this acrobat performs seems virtually impossible. Cirque Du Soleil has yet to amaze us again! Other of my favorite acts include ariel contortion in silk. This is done by Issabel Chasse, the same girl who was in the group contortion in Nouvelle Expirience (an earlier cirque show.) Diabolos is a good act, it is performed by cute little asain girls who catapult chinese yoyos in the air. Jump roping is also good, it is full of many energetic performers. This cirque show is just amazing, I highly recomend it.
