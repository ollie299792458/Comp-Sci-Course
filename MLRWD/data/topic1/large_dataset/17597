Worst movie Ive ever seen....better watch some cartoons in order to waste your time in something more prolific.

Trust me.

********EDITED***********

Well, after receiving some comments about my review, I think I will try again.
It is NOT the worst movie Ive ever seen, I was a little over the top on that, but I really did not like the movie. Although I respect the hard work of the people involved in this project (thank GOD we do movies in Hollywood), something didnt work properly. I believe the acting was poor, the relationship between the two main characters didnt show any hint of evolution. Was it love at first sight maybe?
The plot evolves so slow that once you get to the main action, it does not fit in the story. Its like "wake them up with a few explosions". But, let me say that the effects were REALLY GOOD, I did like that. There isnt enough background story about the other planet, or the situation they are in. It just happens. Some may like this kind of introduction, but I was expecting something else.
Perhaps Iam wrong, and I was hoping for something that wasnt there at the beginning.
Who knows...next time maybe.

Dear Red Baron, the word Prolific means(in english) : "Highly productive"

Peace, always.
