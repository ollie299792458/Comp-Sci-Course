I hadn't realized until I had read all the reviews that I really have forgotten how the movie ended, but it was a hilarious movie to watch. Yeah, if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is, but if they had passed up on the deal, we would not have The Long, Long Trailer to enjoy year after year. Priceless sight gags that were mentioned, like Lucy struggling to put together a meal when the trailer's actions sent all the ingredients flying, and the pans rolling across the stove. Or when the trailer got stuck and Lucy ends up in a mud bath. I was definitely with Lucy when she nervously looked down the ravine as Nicky was navigating the mountain road. It was really funny when she took over the driving, scaring her husband out of his gourd. As for all those rocks, poor Nicky thought Tacy had obeyed his order to get rid of them, only to find she had hidden them inside the trailer walls. Oh, well, that's what comedies are made of -- lots of laughs. Just the kind of movie to watch in the safety of your living room, without worrying about remembering trailer brakes before station wagon brakes.
