Outlaw Star is truly a great show. Is it really serious like Evangelion? Oh definately not. Is the animation really superb like Blue Submarine No. 6 or Texhnolyze? Not likely. So then why is it good? Simple. Outlaw Star boasts fun and entertaining characters, creative ideas in each episode not seen earlier in the show (it kind of keeps evolving, so-to-speak), and might I add that it also boasts awesome opening and closing songs.

The show begins with Gene, the main character, and his partner Jim. Through an odd set of coincidences over the first handful of episodes, they end up stuck with a prized human/android named Melfina and the ship she can connect to, which Gene titles obviously as the Outlaw Star.

Gene, Jim, and Melfina are joined by two other social outcasts as the show carries onward. The first is Aisha Clanclan, a CtarlCtarl commander exiled from her empire due to her... irrationality? Ya that's about right. Then there is "Twilight" Suzuka, a superb fighter rivaling even Gene.

The five come together and travel through thick and thin, from deep under sea with an odd old man to deep in space in the Haiphong Space Race.

The ending gets a little bizarre as the characters near the sought-after Galactic Leyline, but even those episodes are fun and very enjoyable. Ultimately, the show is a smash success easily worth the money for this marvelous 6 disc, 3 DVD case box set. If you need a change from watching intense animes and would like something comical and easy but not stupid, give Outlaw Star a try.
