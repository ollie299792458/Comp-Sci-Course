WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!

I haven't read the book, but I did see the movie.  Has anyone noticed some of the blatant inaccuracies in it?

(see below)

First of all, Permian did not even advance to the state championship game in 1988.  They lost to Dallas Carter 14-9 in the semis.  Carter went on to beat Converse Judson for the state title, 31-14, but was later stripped of the title due to using an ineligible player (I believe this was the team that Jesse Armstead played on).

Also, there is no way Permian played Dallas Jesuit in the early rounds of the '88 playoffs, as indicated in the movie.  Jesuit is a Catholic school, which have their own playoffs (TCIL) as opposed to the public schools (UIL).  And even in cases where Jesuit plays public schools, Jesuit would be classified as a 4A school, not 5A like Permian.

Here is the playoff path for each team:

Bi-dist: Permian 31 Amarillo Tascosa 7  Carter 21 Plano East 7
Area:  Permian 41 El Paso Andress 13  Carter 28 Dallas Samuell 0
Region:  Permian 48 Irving Nimitz 7  Carter 31 Lufkin 7
Quarter: Permian 21 Arlington Lamar 7  Carter 22 Marshall 18
Semis:  Carter 14 Permian 9

Again, I don't know if the book made these mistakes, or if this was "poetic license" on the part of the screenwriters.  I can see how putting Permian in the state championship game is more dramatic, but why couldn't they simply stick to the facts?  Losing in the semis is pretty dramatic, too.

OTOH, if movie viewers recall Carter's disqualification, they might rightly ask why Permian wasn't awarded the '88 5A title; and of course, the answer would be: because they didn't make the finals. Judson did, and *they* were awarded the title upon Carter's disqualification.

There *is* one thing the movie got right: Permian *did* win state in 1989.
