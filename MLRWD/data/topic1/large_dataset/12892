Saw Bugsy yesterday and after 14 years of being released, it doesnt hold up. Beatty isnt bad as Bugsy Siegel, in fact he actually does a very good job IMO. Benning on the other hand, i could not tolerate her character at all, and kept wondering why someone as clever as BUgsy would let a Harlet let Benning be his downfall.

 Ben Kingsley and Harvey Keitel are excellent as always with every film. The set design is beautfiul, but i wont give Barry Levinson points for that. He has been working on the set for over 20 years if you go back to "Diner" and such movies.

 The violence in this film is badly filmed as well. A fight between Bugsy and Johny A is horribly filmed and for the most part the sounds of the punches/knees dont match up and it doesnt even look like Bugsy is hitting him.

 Plot wise, I kept waiting for more. No mob violence, no huge plot arcs, no character development. You could see the ending coming a mile away even if you didnt know the history of Bugsy. IMO Bugsy came across as a medicore talented man. I think his "vision" is played up too much. Hes easily wrecked by some two bit tramp and he has no feet grounded in reality. My only dissappointment is that when he gets his in the end, Benning isnt right there to get it with him.

  And upon hearing Bugsy is dead, Bennings character actually goes into tears. All this after she has stolen 2 Million in Bugsy's and mob money. Yeah I feel sorry for her.

  Goodfella's this aint.
