The Silverado of the title is a town where all the main characters in the movie eventually meet up. There isn't really an overriding plot to the story. More like lots of subplots that collide from time to time. Scott Glenn and Kevin Coster are brothers on their way to Silverado to see their sister before heading on to California. Glenn just happens to have spent time in prison for killing a member of the family that owns most of the land around the town. Along the way they meet Kevin Cline who ends up riding with them to Silverado. Along the way he meets up with Brian Dennehy, an old friend he used to ride with before going to jail. Somewhere in all this they meet Danny Glover who is on his way back to the family farm.

Silverado has a great cast that also includes Jeff Goldblum, John Cleese and Linda Hunt. The action is rousing and well choreographed. The movie is a little long and could have used a trim timewise and cleaning some of the subplots up would have helped, but overall this is a very good western, especially for being made at a time when westerns weren't made.
