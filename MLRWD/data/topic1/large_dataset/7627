I bought this set the day it was released, saw the inner card announcing the second season for the following Spring, and thought how difficult it would be to wait six months for the next season...

Well, that was over two years ago, and not only has season two on DVD never seen the light of day, but neither have the other five seasons which should have already been out by now. This is an abomination! Clearly one of the most classic series ever, it is a disgrace that the other seasons have not been briskly delivered, when shows like "Punky Brewster" and "Gilligan's Island" are covering store racks.

This set here, the first, is without a doubt one of the best TV series DVD sets I have seen. The shows are all masterfully remastered, with gorgeous crisp picture and sound. It is a totally different experience watching these on disc then the muddy, faded prints that have been running on TV, in syndication for years. The extras are also a pleasure, and the making-of documentary is impressive (and they just cover the first season!).

There is no question that this is in the top five best sitcoms ever, and that the rest of the series needs to be on DVD...pronto! I heard a rumor about the second season being released in two parts...to lower the cost. Pathetic. If that's the case, I think another studio should have been releasing this series to disc. With shows having the same number of episodes per season being released today, in the $30-40 range, I don't think it's necessary to do that. I think another studio (besides Fox) should take over and give us fans the deserving tribute for this show that we request.
