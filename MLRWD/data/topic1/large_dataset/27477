The new "Tinker Taylor..." is not a bad movie, although it strains to recapture the glory days of John LeCarre's spy genre and the grim gloaming of the Cold War. Gary Oldman is good as George Smiley if not quite as rolypoly as LeCarre's nerdy spy chief. I kind of preferred Alec Guiness in the older versions who actually DID nerdy and owlish very well. When I see Oldman I see an epicene Dracula with fake Korean nailshop glue-ons bemoaning his lost love, Winona Ryder as Lucy Westenra, but hey, that's just me.

This Tinker Taylor does capture the intricacy of the LeCarre magnum opus and the sordid infighting of the Cold War, Allen Dulles, James Jesus Angleton, et al., and the characters, notably Colin Firth, give us credible human types. But the film loses continuity somewhere in the middle, failing to explain clearly enough HOW Smiley and Circus came to find there was a mole (Firth) in their midst, and how they ferreted said mole (ok, so now I'm lapsing into subterranean animal metaphors...)from within the Circus.

A good movie, considering some of the crap being made these days (including most anything by Tarentino) but not the best homage to LeCarre's brilliance of yore.

Rent the movie, but save time to go through it again to figure out what you didn't get the first time. And take lots of plonk as you watch...
