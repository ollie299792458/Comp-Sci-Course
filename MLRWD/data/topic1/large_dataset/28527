I have to admit I've never seen the original British production, so I went into this blind. I absolutely loved the musical numbers; the fact that everyone was lip-syncing recordings of the era didn't really bother me. Bernadette Peters was terrific, and I understand that the real life scenes are supposed to be bleak. What put me off was Steve Martin. I can appreciate him trying to branch out as an actor, but he simply doesn't have the dramatic chops to pull off such as role. His character is unsympathetic to the point where I was hoping something dreadful would happen to him around the 35 minute mark. I imagine the character was more fleshed out in the British version, but here he comes across as a whiny horndog who cheats and lies and pretty much treats everyone around him like garbage because life didn't go his way. There should be shadings somewhere in there that Martin simply cannot provide. Honest emotion is not his strong suit. That being said, the movie moves briskly enough, and everyone else gets an A for effort.
