It's a short movie see but not short on thrills.  It's gotta be short cause like you out there watching our poor guy Al Roberts doesn't have time either.  Time; That's just what he'll be doing if the fuzz get wise to what's happened.
Al is a talented and going no where fast piano player.  He's a good guy the kind you only see in old movies, but this isn't just an old movie it's a film noir.  Why name it noir?  To make it arty.  I guess it's better then film black which is what the future is looking here for good ole Al.
So why such negativity bub?  If Al's on the up and up.  Well his girl is sick of the night club scene see, so instead of marrying Al she's doing the opposite literally and heading to L.A.
Al needs his girl bad so he's heading to L.A but the only bad he's got is luck and plenty of it.  A ride he hitches ends up hitching a ride to the pearly gates during a rain storm leaving Al looking responsible, he comes up with a plan but like all plans things happen.  One of those things is Vera a tough as nails girl who sees through Al like a window; kind of like a rear window, which fits like a glove seeing Al is like a wrong man framed out of an old Hitchcock flick.  He's not the wrong man though or do we have it all wrong? Talk about when it rains it pours, better put on your overcoat it's going to be a bumpy ride.

That was fun and so is this film noir.  It's all about the dialogue in these films and this one has it.  It doesn't take a wrong turn in this fast paced hour and 7 mins full of thrills.
Very highly recommended.  One of the most enjoyable noirs I've ever seen.

DVD
As for the dvd.  It doesn't have any special features.  I didn't expect much from the picture but it wasn't all that bad, however at certain parts it does mess up a bit.  All and all for the price and the quality of the movie it's worth it.
