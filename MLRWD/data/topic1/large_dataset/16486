We are so caught in the rush of having, doing, collecting, running and judging the world accordingly that we never stop to think what of all of it is really useful to us. What do we really want? What would we keep, with certainty, if we just eliminated everything that made noise and kept o.n.l.y. what was absolutely left. Absolutely is the key here!

Try it and you'll see that you still keep more than you really want.

It's only when it's too late that we remember that all we wanted to do is to sit quietly and watch the sun rise, or set. The ocean come full at tide or for the school buss to raise it's red light and park behind it quietly watching the kids cross safely with a smile on your face.

Such is this movie.

A very quiet movie that reminds you that less is not more and more is not less. But less than too much is good for you, I the world and even All Gore...

If it's too quiet for you, forgive me. I really got carried away with the movie aftertaste.
