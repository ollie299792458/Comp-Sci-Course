...this movie was based on a book, which was unbelievable, and they are very different... Lisa, Angelina Jolie's character, is the equivilant to MacMurphy, and Winona Ryder's character is the equivilant to Chief Bromde, the big Indian, not to mention the Ken Kessey, the author of One Flew Over The Cookoo's Nest, wrote it as a work of fiction, while Girl Interupted was supposed to based on a true story.  And don't say that the picture quality was bad because it was made in 1975 and they didn't have the same quality cameras and the same special effects that they do now...i personally liked to book tremendously more.  In the book, the story was told from the point of view of Chief, so that you could see the reason that he was so crazy and because some of the main themes were things that Chief thought in his head and were not expressed in the movie.  Even though i liked the book more, i thought that the movie was amazing.  Jack Nicholson, i also loved him in the Shining, is one of my favorite actors, and Brad Dourif, the man who plays Billy Bibbit, did a tremendous job and looked exactly as i pictured him when reading the book.
