As a fan of Cate Blanchett I was only really watching for her performance and wasn't expecting much of the film. However I was suprised by the quality of the other actors and enjoyed the film a great deal.

Positive: Cate Blanchett as Annie. No more needs to be said. Even in a lower key film with a weaker story such as The Gift she is fantastic.

Giovanni Ribisi is also fantastic as a deeply disturbed young friend of Annie. I was really suprised with his abilities to portray that kind of character. Even in the most horrific scence with his father you still feel immensely sorry for him. The other supporting cast including Keanu Reeves, Greg Kinnear and Hilary Swank all give solid performances and Reeves is actually really creepy.

The cinematography was really effective and suited the genre well, making use if the southern landscape to great effect.

Negative: Katie Holmes. I felt absolutley nothing for her character and I felt that was aprtly down to her performance. It was a little wooden but this may be partlydue to the little screen time she gets to develop her character.

The story did on occasion seem to drag and the courtroom scenes broke the pace and tension of the film and were too long.

I didn;t find the ending predictable but was too abrupt and would like to have seen more interaction between the killer and Annie.

Overall a good film with a great cast and the finest leading lady it could have hoped for.
