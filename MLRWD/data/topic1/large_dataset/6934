My only complaint about this movie...it was too short.  I could have  watched another hour if the quality stayed the same.  It was unfortunate  that Run Lola Run didn't have move exposure in the US.  It was the perfect  fusion of form and function.  I'm not sure what played a more important  role, the music, the story, or the red hair.  They were all intertwined so  perfectly that I found myself drawn in more than I've found with almost any  other movie.  
This movie is driven by a pulsating, drving beat.  I found  myself unable to keep from moving with it.  But, it's more than just a  music video.  The story behind this movie, similar to Sliding Doors, is one  of "What if..."  It takes you through three different scenarios  showing how everything is affected by everything else.  The slightest  change can cause an entire day to go differently for everyone.  The  metaphysical ramifications are astounding.  The future's not fixed.  Our  lives aren't predetermined.  It's also frightening.  One small change can  alter the entire course of history.
Of course, this is completely  unnecessary to enjoy the movie.  What this movie lacks is tedium.  It never  lets you down and is always engaging.  It also has very red hair.
