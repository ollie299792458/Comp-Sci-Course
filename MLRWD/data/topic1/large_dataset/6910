I was intrigued to see this movie after all the positive reviews, but the spookiest thing about it is how many people praise it for absolutely no sane reason known to the natural world.  It is truly terrible, and deeply, profoundly boring.  The supposed twist -- the premise on which the whole movie is based -- is obvious from the first five minutes (and is the oldest plot twist that can been found in fourth rate horror movies and old TV shows) so that the "shocking" final frames of the film are laugh-out-loud funny.  There isn't a genuinely creepy, macabre, spooky, spine-tingling moment in the whole movie -- except maybe for the close-ups of the lead actress, who is wierder and creepier looking that any of the ghouls wearing pancake white make-up and kohl-ringed eyes who keep rising bug-eyed out of the lake.  Each supposed shock and eerie moment (and there are all too few of them) is telegraphed ahead of time like the roar and whistle of a steam locomotive bearing down on you.  And none of the underlying plot points make any sense:  The main character is supposedly driving across country to take a job in a small Utah town as a church organist (the supposed irony being that she isn't religious) -- but who in the world works at a full-time job working as a church organist (who only plays on Sundays, but apparently spends the other six days of the week "practicing").  And why would you ever travel across country to take such a job in a tiny town in the middle of nowhere?  And what tiny church in a tiny town conducts a nation-wide search just to employ an organist?  That's only the beginning of the absolutely absurd and nonsensical plot points that underlie the entire movie.  I just don't get all the rave reviews -- this is the kind of movie that would have been a perfect object of ridicule on Mystery Science Theatre 3000.
