Vin Diesel was born to play Riddick.  I'm not a big Diesel fan, but no one could have been better in this film.  His physique, attitude, voice, etc. were perfect for this role.  I was very impressed.

The film also made great use of special effects and sound effects.  The crash scene of the ship was great.  But, the aliens did look a little fake at times.  What really made this movie was the cinematography.  The camera angles and spectacular lighting really made you feel like you were there in the movie.

The acting wasn't the best I've ever seen, but it was passable.  Taking in consideration that the cast was made up of mostly B-listers, I'll let it slide.

I probably would have given this film a four star rating, but the problem is that the plot is the same thing we've seen a million times.  A group of people are stuck in a place (be it a house, hotel, city, planet, whatever) and they are overrun by a horde of nasty creatures.  Been there.  Done that.  All-in-all it is a really good film. One that I will probably be adding to my collection and I've very excited to see the sequal.  It's the next film I'll be renting.
