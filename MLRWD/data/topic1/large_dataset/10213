I didn't really have high hopes for this movie but sometimes you're just in the mood for a scary movie set in the snowy woods of Maine. 
The best things about this film were the chilling opening credits and the special effects. The beginning of the film showed some promise; the characters seemed to have some depth and the story was mysterious.  But once the four got together in that cabin, the whole thing took a nose-dive. It turned into a bad version of "The Thing." But it wasn't scary. It was funny without trying to be. The possessed guy sounded like Mr. Wick from the Drew Carey Show. This is the only time I've seen Morgan Freeman suck. (The script's fault, not Morgan's) 
In the interview with Stephen King on the DVD, he sums it all up when he says that the main reason he wrote the book was for the toilet scene. He wanted that scene to do for the toilet what Psycho did for the shower. The main difference being, the Psycho scene was scary. 
This DVD contains "deleted" scenes; they really should have deleted all of them.
In closing, I believe that the only people to have made a decent film based on a Stephen King story are Tobe Hooper and Stanley Kubrick...
