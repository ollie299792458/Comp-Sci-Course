The Great Escape portrays the heroism of prisoners  never giving into their captors and the pompous honor of Nazi Germany.  The group becomes a monkey wrench at all turns determined to send their adversary to the Russian front.  My only complaint is that it is shown in letterbox format which saps some of the power of the story.  Wasn't this picture worth a full screen format?  But this is probably par for the epics of that era.  The stars had to carry the load and be bigger in life even though you are peeking through a window.  Steve McQueen was a man of epic tales and this one does not fail to deliver.  Even doomed to failure he never gives up.  Resist with every last breath was the motto of the prisoners.  Guile and guts served them well and in the end Germany was defeated even if only in small part by the escapades of the escapees.  Grit abounds through the fiber of every man sworn to serve the Allied forces.  We owe these men a debt we can never repay, but always respect.  It takes courage to put your own well being second behind the cause.  Unfortunately we have seldom triumphed in glory since that time.  This war made sense while successors seemed steeped in politics.  Something a normal person has a hard time understanding.  Let's just hope that global war was put to rest with this one.  We can look back on the Great Escape with admiration and gratitude.  But we can never repay what was sacrificed by these men.
