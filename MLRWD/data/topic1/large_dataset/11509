The great Argentinian flick NINE QUEENS gets an American redux as CRIMINAL, with John C. Reilly (of CHICAGO and BOOGIE NIGHTS and MAGNOLIA) and Diego Luna (of Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN) and Maggie Gyllenhaal (of many of my most impure thoughts). Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney produced the remake (their second remake of this sort, after WELCOME TO COLLINWOOD, which remade the far superior BIG DEAL ON MADONNA STREET), and Soderbergh co-wrote it under a pseudonym (Sam Lowry, which is the name of the hero of BRAZIL, which happens to be my favorite movie).

This one is a lot more successful than WELCOME TO COLLINWOOD, if only because it is not just very faithful to the story of the original film, but also to the overall spirit. Unfortunately, in that way, the only thing the remake really has to offer is that is mostly in English (there is a touch of subtitled Spanish too) and the actors are cool. I mean, I have to admit a slight regret that this awesome cast was to put to use doing a film I've basically watched before.

Far from a misfire, and certainly worth a look if you are too lazy to read.
