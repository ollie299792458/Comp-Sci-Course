The comparisons made to The Sixth Sense are well-founded, but from a personal standpoint, I have to admit one difference, and I don't know if the difference is necessarily because of something within me or the movie. The Others, unlike The Sixth Sense, always lets the audience know that there is something awry. 
In spite of its dealings with the supernatural, The Sixth Sense sells to the audience that they are watching the narrative of a boy figuring out how to cope with his gift/curse, until the twist at the very end. With The Others, there is no such attempt. Something is amiss, but we just aren't sure what it is. Is it the servants? Is it the husband? Is it the house itself? I found myself trying to decipher the many clues it left, whereas in The Sixth Sense, I wasn't led to look for clues, and that is the fundamental difference in the way the ending is revealed.
It works well for the director, who seems to enjoy the fact that he knows something that the audience doesn't, and sort of toys with them by dropping little clues here and there. When the ending came, I wasn't exactly shocked, but I wasn't exactly expecting it, either. Either way, I was thoroughly entertained.
