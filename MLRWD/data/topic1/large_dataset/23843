The trailers for EQUILIBRIUM kick a**. Guns, explosions, Matrix-style shots, a futuristic world, Taye Diggs and Christian friggin' Bale. But while the trailer looked attractive, it's well-known that many a polished trailer has masked a giant turd of a movie. I was willing to take that chance, however, and picked up this flick one night to see if it had the goods.

The result? One h*ll of an action flick, that's what!

It's not enough that EQUILIBRIUM was rife with things that went BOOM. The fact that it fused action with martial arts made it that much cooler, much like what the Matrix did by melding martial arts and cyberpunk. From there, it held me on the edge of my sofa with a suspenseful man-versus-Big Brother plot wrapped inside the bigger theme of feelings and emotions and how mankind would be nothing without them. Bale's character misses a dose of his emotion-numbing medication one day and--bada-bing--the tide of revolt against Big Brother has turned.

And the ending didn't disappoint, although it was a bit easier for Bale to save the world than I thought it should be. There was also A LOT of dummy dialogue that was used to bring the audience up to speed on the backstory. Very clumsy and awkward. The biggest complaint, however, focuses on the irony of many of the bad guys getting angry at Bale and the freedom fighters. In a world where emotion is a criminal offense, why doesn't anyone take them in?

Now I'm not saying EQUILIBRIUM is a great movie in strictly cinematic terms. It's imperfect and flawed. But in terms of an action picture? Rarely does it get better than this. If you like your action fast, explosive, and hardcore, do yourself a favor and rent EQUILIBRIUM.
