For decades we've seen this movie. We know it as the back of our hands. You already done a fantastic piece of work by releasing the essential Led Zeppelin DVD Box Set.

Having found the Madison Square Garden tapes (that's undeniable because of the previously unseen footage on the 2 DVD Box Set) my question is simple:

WHERE IS THE DIRECTOR'S CUT?.

I can't believe this is a copy-paste DVD from the VHS we already have. Why not the uncut footage instead?. We've seen the filming scenes... and we don't like them, face it my friend. All that stuff is just pointless, filler, pathetic. I give this 3 star just for the concert alone and the parts we can see the band playing.

Its so annoying not to be able to see John's keyboard solo Paul on Not Quarter, or Bonzo's quintessential solo on Moby Dick, the interpretacion of Dazed And Confuzed, Rain Song, etc.

Easily the most memorable, viewed and  recalled part of the whole film is Stairway To Heaven... not only for the song but it appears complete without any scenes interruption!.

Moreover, even we can't have the complete version of Heartbreaker, and it's probably that also exist Celebration Day.

It's about time that you make justice to this document of the history of the music, truly, we are tired of waiting.

PLEASE, LET IT HAPPEN, AT LEAST IN THE NAME OF BONZO.

MERCI
