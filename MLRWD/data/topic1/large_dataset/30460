There is no way that enough could be said about the film "Lawrence of Arabia."
Based loosely on Lawrence's book "Revolt in the Desert," which is an abridged version of "Seven Pillars of Wisdom."
This is the definitive classic film from a transitional time just before salacious movies became the norm.  It is to director David Lean's credit that he chose patently unknown actors (at the time) for his key roles that truly made this film soar.  The fact that they performed so exceptionally is a testament to the professionalism and dedication of those actors.
The contributions of "Lawrence of Arabia" to future films are seen to this day in the cinematographic techniques and  similar shots in recent films.
Compared to Lawrence's books, the film, by virtue of its medium can never capture the Shakespearean quality language that T.E. Lawrence possessed.  If any book parallels the film it would be Lowell Thomas's 1925 book, "With Lawrence in Arabia," that recounts the journalist's experience as an "imbedded" reporter with Lawrence.  Thomas is often credited with spreading the stories of Lawrence's Arabian exploits that made him so popular in the west.
A simply brilliant film on par with Lean's "Bridge on the River Kwai." A motion picture nearly as remarkable as the man himself.
