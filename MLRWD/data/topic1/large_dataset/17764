...A very suspenseful sci-fi thriller made in the 50's it scared the HOLY H#$L out of me when I was a kid. Sure the monster is a guy in a rubber suit and the acting is all hammy and hokey and there are obvious flaws like shooting a gun in a pressurized cabin or worse grenades going off,it still has a good story and is cleverly directed. The monster is mostly in the dark and wisely not seen clearly (ALIEN) in every scene. And though the actor is in a rubber suit there is something about those big shoulders and enormous hands that makes it work. From the beginning when you see his shadow on the wall and hear him breathing and the spaceship door slowly closing as he is coming on board with no one around, in fact they are all several floors above him with sealed doors between them you begin to get that feeling of impending doom. The movie gave me nightmares  that at times I still have to this day (due no doubt to an over active imagination) but I still loved it! Forget the fact it is over 40 years old and there is no blood and guts....the suspense and good story that moves along well is what makes IT work.
