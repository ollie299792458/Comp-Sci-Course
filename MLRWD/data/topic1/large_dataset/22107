I've wondered for some time now why the first story to feature popular companion Leela (Louise Jameson) was the last such story to receive a DVD release from the BBC. No matter now, though, because "The Face of Evil" is finally available, and it was well worth the wait. Sandwiched between the groundbreaking "The Deadly Assassin" and the brilliant "Robots of Death" (also by "Face" scribe Chris Boucher), this story of a computer gone mad thanks to the intervention of the Doctor himself often gets overlooked by fans looking back at the series' Golden Age of the mid-1970s. That's unfortunate, since the clever plot and noteworthy performances make it one of the most enjoyable outings of the period. Jameson, in particular, acquits herself nicely in her debut story, and the dynamic between her feral savage and Tom Baker's Time Lord is still unlike any other Doctor-companion relationship in the show's 49-year history. The reveal of the titular face is one of the all-time great cliffhanger moments. In all, a must have for fans of this series!
