I'm not going to both reviewing the movie. I'm sure you've all seen it, and we all know it's wonderful; one of very few perfect films. The 4 star rating is only because of the quality of the disc.
Why do we get such a  poor quality transition to DVD. There are too many moments, especially the  dark scenes, where it looks like you're watching a trailer downloaded from  the internet, the digitisis it shows. And why isn't the widescreen version  enhanced for widescreen TV's. Instead of, like on the better discs, where  you can stretch the image you have too zoom in, therefore decreasing the  picture quality more. And, OK, the commentary is very interesting, but they  keep going on about these great outtakes they had, but they're not on the  disc. I'm happy I bought this film on DVD, just because it is such a great  film. But, like the Seven DVD, it is one that I will probably have to buy  again when a new, more feature packed, edition comes along. So, if you can  wait I would suggest you do, because there is surely going to be another  edition on its way some time soon.
