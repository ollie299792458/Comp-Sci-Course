It's never made clear in this otherwise aboove average movie why some clerics in the Catholic Church are protecting Pierre Broussard, a Nazi collaborator.  Are they Nazi sympathizers?

At one point in the film one of the priests sympathetic to Broussard says that Broussard is a good guy because he fought during the War against France falling into the hands of the communists.  But, still, Broussard was a Nazi collaborator.

Also, the movie doesn't make it clear how widespread support for Broussard was among the police, the Church and the French government.

I have the feeling that the people who put this film together were afraid to speculate -- or for that matter specifically indicate -- just how widespread the support for Broussard was in the Church, the government and the police.

The movie itself is very well done.  I especially like Norman Jewison and Michael Caine's work over the years.  The DVD contains a commentary by director Norman Jewison that I wish included Michael Caine.  Michael Caine is extremely articulate in discussing acting and filmmaking, so it was a shame he didn't team up with Norman Jewison in discussing the movie.
