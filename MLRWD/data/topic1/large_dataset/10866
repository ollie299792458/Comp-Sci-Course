I bought this DVD because it was an AMICUS film and I am a fan of AMICUS/Hammer films, but more importantly, the positive general reviews are what  made me buy the Torture Garden DVD.  I really thought this movie was going to be scary, when in fact it was a dud.  The first story was about the cat/gold coins and it was pretty good.  My Mom and I were hoping that the following stories were going to be better than the first, but that is not the case.  The following stories did not keep us on the edge of our seats.  I would highly recommend buying the DVD Tales of the Crypt/Valut of Horror instead.  Dr. Terror's House of Horrors is another good one to get, but it is not available in the U.S.

I would have rated Torture Garden one star, but I have to give Peter Cushing, Burgess Meredith and Jack Palance credit for their roles in this movie.  I also recognized actress Barbara Ewing, who was in the movie, Dracula has Risen from the Grave.  She was in the 3rd story of The Torture Garden, Mr. Steinway,  a story that I would describe as, "Are you kidding me?  This is not how the story ends?!?!"  It was as if they were running out of time/moeny and had to wrap on the story with a corny ending.

I will sell you mine for half the price if anyone wants this movie because if I could return it to get my money back, or receive an Amazon credit, I would.  I really feel disappointed on this purchase.
