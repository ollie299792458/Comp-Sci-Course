I haven't received my Mega Box set just yet, but I wanted to give a special thank you to "Dani Girl" and "Patricia Gabriel" for their very descriptive reviews.  Thanks to you others as well.  (Even to the 'haters' because it helps to know the flaws so you know what to expect).

I have been an MJ fan most of my life (I'm 56). I can remember exactly where I was when I first heard "I want you back".  I told my mom and my sisters, "this kid is going to be around forever".

I guess I thought he really would always be here. But sadly, that has not happened.  I miss him. I miss his smile, his giggle...just knowing he was still around. And now I find myself searching for those interviews and clips that we've all seen just so I can see him again.  I'm glad someone saved them, and is sharing them with all of us grieving fans.

So once again, thank you to those of you who have bothered to do reviews.  They are always very helpful.

P.S.  [...] is another place where you can find vintage Jackson and MJ stuff that you can't find here.
