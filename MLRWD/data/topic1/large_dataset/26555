I am sorry but I cannot agree with all the "wonderful and awesome" reviews this movie has received here.  I thought it made the American soldiers look like "idiots".  The characters were so "dumbed down" it was pathetic and the language was atrocious. I dont know why film makers these days have to fill the movies with garbage.  My husband and I watched about 1/2 of the first disk and then took the movie out and threw it to the side.  A week or so later, we decided maybe we didnt give it a fair chance and my husband watched the whole movie.  He said it never got better. I guess we were just expecting a movie like you see on World War II or something.  I know there were many heroes in this war too but it made them look like poor stupid little "drop out kids" where the military was maybe the only chance they had in life.  To me peeing and trying to write USA in the sand with their pee and comparing their size etc was not funny.  For those of you that claim you served, I feel sorry if you feel this movie did you honors!!!!
