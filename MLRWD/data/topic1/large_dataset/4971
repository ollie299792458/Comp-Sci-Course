THE LAST LEGION is a MUST SEE for Colin Firth fans.  His performance is excellent - complex, multi-layered, sensitive and thoughtful (of course!), virile, funny at times, romantic... and impressively athletic (he evidently did his own sword-fighting and much of his own horse-riding; he'a a good rider, too!).  Really a good performance, very affecting, and will stay with you long after you've seen the film.
Colin Firth's performance here is a fascinating contrast with other recent work of his (for example, Where the Truth Lies or Nanny McPhee); and it's also fun to compare it with portrayals of soldiers he did as a younger actor (Tumbledown, Lost Empires, A Month in the Country).
Clearly this film didn't have the budget it should have, to have been really great; the director admits as much in his commentary on the DVD.  Nonetheless, it is quite entertaining and I find, more satisfying each time I view it.
The rest of the cast is quite good, there's really good chemistry and camraderie amongst the group of soldiers (including Rai's gorgeous warrier), the young emperor (Thomas Sangster), and Ambrosinus (Sir Ben Kingley); and the scenery is beautiful.  Suspend your disbelief and enjoy Colin's performance.
