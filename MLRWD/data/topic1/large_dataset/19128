I owned a VHS workprint of this film and I have to say that after countless viewings over the years which wore out the sound and image, it is a welcoming surprise to finally get such a clean transfer of this film on DVD.  Everything on this DVD is super crisp.  After watching the Deluxe Edition two times in a row I threw my workprint copy in the garbage even though it was the uncut version of the film.  Yes, this new version is that good!

I especially like the tie in between this film and Weekend at Bernie's.  In Friday the 13th Part VII, we get an alternate version of Bernie's death before his corpse is discovered by the characters played by Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman in the 1989 comedy classic.  The only discrepancy in Friday the 13th Part VII is that it doesn't explain how Bernie's body was brought from Camp Crystal Lake to the beach house community near Rhode Island where Weekend at Bernie's takes place.  I was hoping that the Deluxe Edition of Friday the 13th Part VII would be able to answer this question through a deleted scene (or at least on the commentary track) but, again, the fans will just have to wait for the next edition of the film to come out and hope it ties up that loose end once and for all.  Still, it's cool to see how Bernie (played by Terry Kiser) made his money by working as a psychiatrist for troubled teens with telekinetic powers before he met Jason Voorhees (unfortunately).

This is also the first film in the Friday the 13th franchise to cast Kane Hodder as Jason who, in the eyes of many fans, is the best actor to ever portray the villain.  The acting in this film is also better that it is in most other Friday the 13th films.  If you were ever curious to see Terry Kiser's acting abilities before he played a corpse in Weekend at Bernie's, then you should definitely see this film.
