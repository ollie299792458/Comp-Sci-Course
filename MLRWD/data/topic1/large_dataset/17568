I don't know how many times I have watched this movie.  And every time I watch it, it never looses a bit of its greatness.  No one can doubt Hopkins is an incredible actor; and he certainly brought his talents to the stage  in this one.  Every movie I have seen him in has been great.  His  characters always seem to be very similar in type: intelligent, intiguing,  and certainly charming.  As Bill Parrish, Hopkins definitely showed his  stuff.  Brad Pitt...I have loved every movie of Pitt's I have seen.  Seven, Legends of the Fall, Fight Club...all stunning.  While he seems to  be a little absorbed in himself, he brings a great show to the screen.  As  "death" I am sure this was a tough role; but Pitt put it on like  he was "death" himself.  Clair Forlani...beautiful, beautiful,  and you got it, beautiful.  Her character's almost youthful naivity and  innocence fit her incredibly in this movie.  Didn't see much as to why she  fell in love with the mysterious character of "death."  But  realize it was more the man in the coffee shop than "death," with  whom she fell in love.  Tears rolled down my cheeks the first time I  watched it, and the last time, and everytime in between.  If you get this  one, expect a little bit of a overly light-hearted love story, but let your  heart run with it.  Enjoy.
