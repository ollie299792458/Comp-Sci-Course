which shows that a film with virtually no effects (and thank God, no CGI--for me it brings a story to a grinding halt-still way too phoney in most cases) but a solid story is still worth more that all the hardware.
Anyone who knows about HAARP and Pine Gap in Australia will realize that the grid thing isnt so far out-they are cooking our atmosphere with microwaves-right now, ostensibly to be able to, as they put it-"communicate with submarines over the horizon"-uh....how do they do it now? What about using satellites-instead of playing God?
Sounds like a cover story-and it is interesting that the film had the guts to show how NZ and OZ were stabbed in the back by this counties Military-they didnt realize that THEY were the guinea pigs until too late.
The idea of using high frequency energies, magnetics and radar for this-dimension jump-is not so far out from a theoretical physics point of view.
If you havent had your attention span destroyed by video games, MTV/mainstream TV or drugs-this is a good little film.
