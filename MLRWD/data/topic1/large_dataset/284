Finally after three years, CBS and Paramount are realeasing the complete first season of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.  I have been watching every episode since the first and have enjoyed almost every one!  Now, with this six disc set, i can watch the first season over and over again which has some of the best classic episodes.

These are the 23 episodes of the first season that will be included.
I have taped (on VHS) every single episode since the third episode of the series, but now i can watch them with much better quality.  This is by far the best show on television!
