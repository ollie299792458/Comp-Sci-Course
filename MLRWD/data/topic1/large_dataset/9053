My mom loves this movie and has searched everywhere to buy it.  Not many movie places sell it (or let you rent), like Blockbuster, Hollywood Video, ect.  We tried Best Buy a few years back and a few other places, but no one has it!!!  I have no idea why, either.  It's such an awesome thriller!

So, I finally fond The Other on Amazon and had bought it just a few days before Christmas!  Amazon was flexible and had really great prices to offer!  I recommend this movie to every horror or thriller buff.  If you are a movie person in general, The Other is really well directed and should be on your list of movies to wach and own.  Also, Uta Hagan directed this movie....which says enough in itself.  This is one of the few moives that she shows in, too.  Mrs. Uta taught Robin Williams how to act and do everything he does on screen, except for the pure talent that he has.

Thank you so much, Amazon!  You really made my mom's Christmas!

ps-If you like the option of having someone else wrap your gifts online....the wrapping paper Amazon provides is exceptional.  They used a beautiful green box for the DVD, and a seafoam green ribbon on the outside.  They even let you write a little message to go on the outside of the packaging!  And...no marks or dents on the present iteself when you open the box!
