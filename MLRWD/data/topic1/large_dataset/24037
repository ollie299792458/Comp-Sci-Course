Terence Stamp's performance as lovable Cockney rogue Wilson is admirable, as he portrays an ex-con recently released from prison. He's learned a few things since his reckless youth, yet his undying love for his only daughter has remained the same. So much so, he travels to L.A in search of the truth, acting upon a newspaper cutting and his instinct that something's wrong. He meets with one of Jenny's associates, who provides a lead to a shady warehouse. Here, in pursuit of justice for his daughter, he opens a can of worms. Although beaten up and thrown outside, he simply pulls out a gun, staggers back inside, and shoots them - save one. "Tell them I'm coming!" he rages after the lone survivor. At once, I knew this film was going to be a great story. Normally, I shun such films marred by extreme, unnecessary violence, but Wilson proves to be a much more sincere person with deeper feelings than any gangster is blessed with. He isn't even a gangster, come that, but more a father out to avenge his daughter. There's more a decent thrilling storyline than outright GBH. But the warehouse scene has got be one of the best parts of the film, where the audience had almost felt his bruises and cuts, and cheered him on to vengeance. It's also humourous in places: his East End accent and way with words confuses the American populace somewhat! Although I very much enjoyed the character, plot and action sequences of this film, it just doesn't quite rate five stars for some reason. Wilson's memories of Jenny are actually part of the story idea behind this film. Who is really to blame? And who has the right to exact vengeance? I'm really glad I hired this film out, to view it twice at least. Be warned: Wilson's coming! A superb Anglo-American drama thriller.
