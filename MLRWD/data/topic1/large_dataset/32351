As always Jane Fonda is fascinating to watch and she does a very good job here with Donald Southerland.
Jane is a high end prostitute that calls in for clients passing through New York City that want some company.  She is very good at her job and enjoys it.  She tells her shrink why she likes it and why she can't enter into a relationship.

Someone is calling her and being obscene over the phone. Meanwhile, a man she knew has died and she is helping the detective working on the case to find the killer.
We get to follow Jane and the detective into the world of drugs, prostitution, high end pimps and parties where people indulge in all of their obsessions.

The film is well shot, the production excellent but most interesting of all are the people we get to meet that Jane has known or dealt with before.  All colorful sorts from her sordid world.

There are a few scenes here and there that seem very dated but aside from that this is very interesting to watch and at times very creepy.
