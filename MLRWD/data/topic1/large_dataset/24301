I read the book years ago, and the film does it justice as well as recreating a lost time and place.  Brad Pitt's forced accent is a bit distracting, but it is authentic-sounding.  The production values were excellent, the scripting virtually flawless as one segment of Pitt/Harrar's life flowed into the next like a tiered waterfall.

The film's politics reflect the Tibetan exile community, whose cooperation was necessary to give it production value.  Pre-"Liberation" Tibetan life is viewed through a nostalgic haze that ignores the unlovlier aspects of its culture.  The "Red Chinese" as portrayed here are a bit over the top for ca. 1950.  Most of the ugliness committed by the PLA was during the 1959 rebellion, or the Cultural Revolution after 1966.  At the early period portrayed here Tibet was granted "autonomy" rather than annexation, or the CIA couldn't have been at work there through the 50s, organizing the '59 rebellion that finished off Tibet as an independent entity.

That said, a great film, well worth its length.
