wuthering heights is an absolute classic film. i searched and searched for a copy of this on DVD in the stores, but i found out it is actually out of print? (Crazy i know) . i decided to look on amazon and found that it was extremely expensive for a U.S. copy of the movie. like $70! i was not going to pay that i just wanted a copy of the film on DVD, bc my VHS copy is completely ancient. i saw this verion (import) and i was a little nervous at first bc the reviews said something about a subtitle in koren that they could not turn off? well i recieved mine and played it and the subtitle is very easily turned of with one click of the 'subtitle' button on the DVD remote. the only people with any issues might bc a collector who wants all perfect packaging, bc the box has some korean writing on it, but whatever for $12 i can't complain.. the dvd plays wonderfully. i dont know if the movie is digitally remastered or anything but it is a pretty clear picture for a movie from the '30's. i have no complaints.
