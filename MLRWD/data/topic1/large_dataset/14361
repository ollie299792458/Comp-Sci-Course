I've seen The Wire series recently, if you wonder where I'm coming from.

Outside of being very one dimensional and boring, the film leaves too many questions without answering.

For example, why could't Cage at least give his wife some HINTS about the kind of case he was involved in?

Or why when he found the diary in the toilet didn't he just hand it to the mother?

Or why, when Cage parked his car in a really rasty area with lots of grubby and suspicious characters nearby, why didn't he lock his car? I'm from that part of California, and I certainly would have.

Or how did Machine know Cage was after him in the house? Cage seemed quiet to me. And where was the mother during all the action? And how did Machine hide in the house so he could restart the record?

The movie depends heavily on characters who are evil without real motive. There may be people like that, but they are quite rare. They aren't rare in cliche hack movies like this one, though.
