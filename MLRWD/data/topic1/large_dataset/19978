I don't really care for subtitled works - darn ignorant, American monolingual slob! But if you're any sort of history buff then this is a video you should watch. Leni R. was, according to whom you believe, Hitler's favorite film maker.  Was she also a propagandist? That's up to you to decide. French courts after WW II wouldn't convict her of anything more than being misguided fool. But Hitler and Goebbels loved her films. Just because they were well-made?
There are all these great questions that I'm sure will be debated for a long time. Was she a great artist, a film maker ahead of her time? I think there isn't that much debate on that topic. She was also an egotist (a requirement of great artists?) and had an almost pathological lying ability.  Why did she have removed the names of her Jewish collaborators from her pre-Hitler films and then say she had no problems working with Jewish artists?  It boggles the mind how she could have been so surprised by the Jewish boycotts during her mid-1930s American tour.
That's our wonderful and horrible Leni.
The video is just excellent. The viewer can see how Leni tries to take control of the film! What biographer ever had such a subject? Fascinating!
