Oren Moverman makes a strong directorial debut after having quite a bit of success as a screenwriter. Here, he relies heavily on his strength for story, yet still finds powerful sequences of visual beauty. Ben Foster plays Will Montgomery, an injured soldier, hardened by war, forced to work alongside a Gulf War Vet. Together they travel through New Jersey informing family members that their son, daughter, husband or wife has died in combat. Montgomery fights this position that requires such human contact, but soon finds kinship with a young mother whose soldier husband has just died. Moverman echoes back to the films of Hal Ashby and Robert Altman in several sequences, using long takes and a constantly probing camera lens. Ben Foster, Woody Harrelson and Samantha Morton all give very strong performances in their respected roles. The weakness, if the only one, comes in Jena Malone's performance. Her development is weak and, worse of all, she never fully commits to the words or moments being experienced by her character. This drags the pacing of the story, but only for the few scenes that include her. Her character requires very little screen time, but this only further pushes the need for a stronger development, yet she fails. However, Foster, Harrelson, Morton and Moverman all succeed in accomplishing something truly honest and sincere in every moment the audience gets to experience with them. This is easily one of the finest films of the year. A true work of art that was grossly overlooked by the Academy.
