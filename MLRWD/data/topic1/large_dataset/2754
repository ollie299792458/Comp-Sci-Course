I'm a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan but The Last Airbender has ZERO elements of his style or creativity and the movie suffers for it. I like his method of film making even though many of his movies are far from perfect in many ways. I have never paid any attention to the Avatar cartoon though I have seen it with my kids. I thought the news that M. Night would be directing The Last Airbender was a stretch for him as this would be his first family oriented film. The movie has elements of Sci-Fi, which M. Night is well versed at, but this is targeted to a completely different audience than any of his previous releases. He seems to have trouble with the transition to making this a family movie. Rather than making the movie his, he went ultra conservative by his standards and made the movie an ultra generic action flick with cool graphics. While this is a rated PG movie, it reminds me of one rated G. The movie barely takes the tone of a rated PG child's film and this really holds back the storyline in a negative way. Every aspect of the storyline is simplified to it's basic literal meaning that no thought is needed. There is no element of surprise or room for interpretation which is the complete opposite of M. Night's style of film making. I'm not a fan of movies spoon feeding the audience. This is unacceptable coming from one of the new film making masters of suspense. Maybe M. Night was under the gun from Nickelodeon to make this movie a certain way which hindered his creative ideas. May he was just in unfamiliar territory by making, in reality, a kids movie. Whatever the case, M. Night failed to deliver and reach his capabilities.

Edit: The Last Airbender can now add Golden Raspberry Award Winner to its list of unimpressive achievements.
