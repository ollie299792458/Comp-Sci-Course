So, you've seen the HELLBOY live action movie, and/or the animated material, loved it, and are thirsting for more tales of the red skinned chief investigator of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense? Lucky for you there are several items currently available that should (at least temporarily) quench your thirst.

If you'd like to relive the movie, try the HELLBOY novelization, by Yvonne Navarro. Navarro is an old hand at adapting screen properties, both large and small (she's done several BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER books, plus novelizations of SPECIES I and II) and can be counted on to do so in a readable and entertaining manner. Her work on HELLBOY is no exception. Writing from director Guillermo del Toro's script, and adding in her own little extras based on her intimate knowledge of the source material (she even gets HELLBOY's alternative spelling of "pancakes," substituting "m" for "n", correct), she produces a faithful adaptation of the movie. If you like her HELLBOY book, you might also sample some of Navarro's original novels. Books like AFTERAGE and MIRROR ME (available from The Overlook Connection Press), THAT'S NOT MY NAME, FINAL IMPACT, and RED SHADOWS are all well worth your time and money.

If you wish to explore the comics that inspired the film, there are several reasonably priced HELLBOY collections available from Dark Horse Comics. The movie's main inspiration comes from HELLBOY: SEED OF DESTRUCTION, written and drawn by HELLBOY 's creator, Mike Mignola, with an able assist from the venerable John Byrne of Superman and X-Men fame. HELLBOY: CONQUEROR WORM explores ideas Mignola touched on in SEED OF DESTRUCTION, finally explaining the origins of the strange race of aliens who appeared in that story.

If you like those, you can sample HELLBOY: WAKE THE DEVIL, HELLBOY: THE CHAINED COFFIN, and HELLBOY: THE RIGHT HAND OF DOOM. WAKE THE DEVIL is one long story, the other two volumes present several stand alone short stories which explore world mythology and folklore (THE CHAINED COFFIN features "The Corpse", an amusing tale whose events feature prominently in the movie). To see how other folks handle HELLBOY and his eclectic supporting cast, try BPRD: HOLLOW EARTH AND OTHER STORIES, and HELLBOY: WEIRD TALES.

If plain old prose is what floats your boat, there are several worthy original HELLBOY novels, among them HELLBOY: ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HELL by Brian Hodge, HELLBOY: THE GOD MACHINE by Thomas Sniegoski, HELLBOY: UNNATURAL SELECTION by Tim Lebbon, and three by Christopher Golden (of OF SAINTS AND SHADOWS fame), namely HELLBOY: THE LOST ARMY, HELLBOY: THE BONES OF GIANTS, and HELLBOY: THE DRAGON POOL.  Golden also ably edited HELLBOY: ODD JOBS, an anthology featuring short stories by the likes of the aforementioned Brian Hodge, Poppy Z. Brite, Nancy Collins, Greg Rucka, and Chet Williamson.
