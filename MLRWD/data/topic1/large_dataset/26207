Eliza Dushku and Desmond Harrington gave great performances for this surprisingly good slasher thriller. The story is about a group of young people that are stranded deep in the hill of West Virginia and are terrorized by a family of deform in-breed. There are the usuall gore (Chainsaw chopping off limbs, axe slash through victim's head) but good direction by director Rob Schmidt and excellent performances by the principal stars make this movie so enjoyable and exciting, And great make up by Stan Winston make the in-breed looks awfully scary. 
The DVD itself is quite good. The Dolby 5.1 is great as director Rob Schmidt points out in his commentary that the effect sound was carefully placed in the surround speakers to make audience more involved in the story. The picture transfer however is just about average. Both Full Screen and Wide screen are provided. Overall this DVD is highly recommended for the genre and it is much better than others such as Scream or I know what you did last summer.
