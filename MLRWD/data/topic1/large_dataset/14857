This film has as much chutzpah as the first record albums from Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin. As far as Western's go, director Sergio Leone abandoned all the Hollywood cliches and makeup artists to make a film that stands as the grittiest of all the Westerns, and since Westerns are about grit, I think this one is the best. Clint Eastwood's dialogue is as sparse as in the other "Dollar" movies, and although this film is shorter than the other two (The Good the Bad and the Ugly, For a Few Dollars More) I think Clint has more memorable lines, and certainly his most memorable -- "My mule don't like people laughin'..." Meanwhile, Gian Maria Volonte's diabolically empassioned performance as the cruel "town boss" Ramon Rojo is truly memorable, displaying why he is as popular in Italy as Clint is in America.
Ennio Morricone's film score is as great as you would expect, and I could say more about this film but other reviewers have done some excellent work. I just wanted to say that I rate this one slightly above The Good the Bad and the Ugly; both of these a half-tick better than A Few Dollars More, but all three are better than any Hollywood western you are ever likely to see.
