I bought this movie based solely on the reviews at Amazon and am dumfounded and astonished that a "Classic" five star rating was used so liberally by so many to describe this movie!  I won't go into the plot since it's been recapitulated many times in previous reviews.  I couldn't wait to see this movie thinking it was a zombie feature along the lines of "Dawn of the Dead" but as I was falling asleep 15 minutes into this banal production, I knew I had been duped!  There is not a single moment of building anticipation in the first three quarters of the movie(with the exception of a "zombie dog" that provides a much needed moment of shock).  I like gore as much as the next horror fan, but being sanguineous for the sake of being sanguineous didn't scare me--it just made me nauseous(i.e. The never ending spider attack and the eternally long face-burned-with-acid scene come to mind).
The"zombies" finally show up the last 20 minutes of the movie, about a dozen of them, and they are so listless and slow a two year old baby could have out fought and out run every one of them!  I implore you to save your money and stay away from this over-hyped disaster!
