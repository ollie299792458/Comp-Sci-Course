This film is excellent. I have watched this three times in one night.
Ten people fly through a timerip and discover that everyone that was awake disapeared.
My favourite part is when the get to the strange world where the Langoliers come and get them. The air is strange, there is no echo, no power unless you are on the plane, when they walk on the ground their feet sound different to normal, the weather goes dark then light again after 40 mins and the food and drinks are flat.
My favourite character is poor poor Mr Toomey. He is a wreck because his father brainwashed him telling him if he doesn't buck up his ideas and stop wasting time, the Langoliers will get him and eat him alive.
The part before they leave you see the Langliers and the chase Mr Toomey, you see the Langliers teeth move all around in a circle and they sort of make a creepy noise and clash their teeth together. The eat up the airport and eat away the strange land and every one except Mr Toomey and Mr Gaffney (Mr Toomey stabs him thinking he is a Langolier) get away.
They look on in horror as the world disapears in to the blackness below.

I give the film 5 Stars!
