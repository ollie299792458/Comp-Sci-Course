I was torn between 4 and 5 stars. For this genre, it is an easy 5 star rating, but it is not my favorite genre, so I would give a 4 star rating for the general public. Since the former is more significant, it deserves 5 stars.
Johnny Depp plays Sam and does another excellent job. This is more in line with "Chocolate" than "Edward Scissorhands" (I liked the former but detest the latter). He is quiet, but entertaining. He is not shown as obsessed with Buster Keaton, but he does bang-up jobs of mimicking him. The scenes in the park are great.
Aidan Quinn is very good as Benny. He holds the role of protective older brother to Joon. Some of his later actions are predictable, but Quinn never falls out of line with his characters.
Mary Stuart Masterson does a good job as Joon (Juniper "Joon" Pearl). Only a couple times does she slip out of character. When she is in-character, she is excellent.
The plot is simple. Some people claim that it is unrealistic. For the majority of people, yes it is. However, truth is stranger than fiction and this is a feel-good movie that reminds us of positive things and looking forward to another day.
The lenghth of the movie is good. Only for a couple minutes during the start did I question if it would go too long (the opening train sequence is visually entertaining, but could have been cut short).
The sound is a big factor for me. This movie comes through with a big thumbs-up. The music is clean and upbeat, like a blend of Gershwin and Supertramp. The editing is excellent (except for one case with the car stopping, but the rest is so much better than normal that it probably shouldn't be mentioned). The sound really put this movie in the 5-star league.
