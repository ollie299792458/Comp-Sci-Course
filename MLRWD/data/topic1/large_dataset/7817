I don't know if Hatchet II is the perfect "movie", but it sure is the perfect slasher movie. It's got everything a slasher needs and more. It's got some of the bloodiest kills I've ever seen (and I thought last years Piranha was gory), it's got some good t&a, a few laugh out loud moments, and some scary thrills. I'd say it's the best slasher movie since the first Hatchet, and it even tops that one. The storyline is great here, as Victor Crowley's history is explored further. I really liked the idea of having a group of people hunting Victor Crowley. That was cool. The acting is very good across the board. Danielle Harris is a slasher movie veteran, having also been in Halloween 4, Halloween 5, Rob Zombie's Halloween, Rob Zombie's Halloween 2, Urban Legend, and Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet. Here, she gives a performance that I'm sure would get nominated for a Horror Academy Awards if there were such a thing. She plays a character of a woman who's been through hell very convincingly. And Tony Todd gets the most screen time I've ever seen him get (and that includes Candyman). And he chews up the scenery like he's at an all you can eat buffet. He gives a very fun performance. And Troma Films President Lloyd Kaufman even has a cameo! Hatchet II is absolutely awesome! Bring on Hatchet 3!!
