You will draw a clear sense of this gripping story from the many other excellent reviews on this site. What I want to comment on is the most amazing cinematographic depiction of HEAT ever brought to the silver screen. I've never experienced anything like it! The movie is set against the backdrop of mid summer in southern Italy - filmed in Potenza. This is the wheat-belt of Italy, and man is it hot. Every scene, every detail draws you back to that essential point - it is molto caldo. The crackle of the wheat sheaths blowing in the hot wind; the scratching of the ants crawling across the burnt dust under the wheat; the buzzing of the cicadas in the dried branches of the shrubs; the glare of the sun and the stark contrasting shadows it creates; the
the rattle of the fan in the dark kitchen, blowing across the sweat-beaded breast of Michele's mother in a loose peasant dress. Pulsating, palpable heat. The movie should have won an Oscar for this giant artistic accomplishment. It is worth seeing for this reason alone, and yet it only the setting for a terrific, compelling, disturbing story. One of the best films I have ever seen.
