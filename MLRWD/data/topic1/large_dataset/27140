I remember seeing this movie on HBO as a kid after my parents went to bed early one night. It left its mark on me. As I've grown older I've come to love this film. I read the book it was based on and although it's different (ie, Rambo dies in the end by the hand of his mentor Trautman,his escape by dirt bike actually takes place with him being naked and having to supply himself from local mountain men, he's also more of a hippie in the novel whereas in the film he's a "full blooded combat soldier"), but that isn't such a bad thing.
I really think that critics don't enough credit to Stallone for his performance in this film especially when it pertains to the final scene between Rambo and Trautman where he breaks down emotionally and recounts all of the horrors of war he has seen first hand and how special he was in Nam, but as a civilian he can't get a job parking cars. The desperation and pain he portrays as he practically begs to be forgiven for becoming a killing machine is like a son asking to be forgiven by his father.
I've spoken with a lot of vets at Veteran's Hospitals and VFW's over the years as a volunteer and they always mention that in my conversations with them that this film was step in the healing process to some of them and their families. That it helped them come to as what Col. Trautman calls "Full Circle".
One of the best extras that I can think of is actually a commentary by the author David Morrell. It helps to explain a lot of the details that usually are glossed over in action films and makes the experience more emotionally exciting.
