Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock continues the story about the Genesis devise and Spock's rise from the dead. After hearing from Spock's father that Dr. Mcoy can save Spock's life, Kirk steals the Enterprise with the help of his crew against his Admiral orders and sets out to save his friend. This is where the real adventure begins when the Klingon's hear about Kirk's plans and rush to intercept Kirk and find the secret behind the Genesis device. Christopher Lloyd did exceptionally well playing the Klingon Kruge and the battle between Kirk and Kruge around the end of the film is worth the price of admission. Even though Kirk is forced to destroy the Enterprise and his son is killed by the Klingons, he is able to rescue Spock and Saavik. This Star Trek entry was good but not as good as the next sequal in the real Trek trilogy (Star Trek 2-4) The new Special Edition DVD is great and includes some interesting bonus material. So if you have'nt yet pick this up and add it to your Star Trek collection now.
