I was 9 years old when Dark Shadows started and even now I cannot remember whether we started watching it from the very beginning or not. I know I liked it, I even had Jonathin Frid's autograph from when they came to our town; but now I love it.

It's funny watching the errors in production, the missed lines the missed marks, but I am older than I was then and the main story line has nothing to do with vampires and it is outstanding; man gets convicted wrongly, serves time, becomes rich and comes back home to straighten things out.

I am in the middle of Collection 3 with number 4 sitting unwrapped and ready to go. My wife has been notified that I would like number 5 & 6 for Christmas, and the first 40 episodes with Barnabas are downloaded and waiting their turn.

Will I end up buying all of the episodes, five years worth of daily soap operas and numbering in the thousands of shows?

Why yes, I think I will. I would like to see it out to the end, and besides, it's not like I will be missing anything on the major networks these days.
