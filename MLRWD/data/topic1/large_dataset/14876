This movie is interesting because it tries to approach the idea of human mortality from an all-encompassing philosophical system by drawing on several different philsophical and theological ideas simultaneously so that no one religion or belief system is emphasized moreso than the other.  By using this approach, the movie attempts to examine and communicate the raw truths of life and death.  The film also communicates to its audience in raw emotion through the use of archetypical characters with often melodramatic performances that succeed even though they shouldn't.  The images of Hell are obviously inspired by Dante's "Inferno".  Though the Hell visuals are impressive, they by no means capture the hopelessness and despair of Hell.  What's most impressive is the director's attempt at visually capturing on film an idea of Heaven.  The attempt alone deserves merit and this is where the film's visuals succeed the most.  On DVD, the colors are rich and bright and serve as a good reference disc to check to see if your TV is calibrated properly.  There are generous extras and the audio mix is about average.  After several repeated viewings, I have come to like this film more and more.
