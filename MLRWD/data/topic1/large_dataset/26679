My wife and I have no children and are not beguiled by movies in general, so it is big news when ANY new movie gets our attention -- most especially an animation.  So we were unmoved by Toy Story and the genre it spawned of big-budget digital animations.  This one is different.  With an eerily lit backdrop of icy landscapes and a story borrowed from the classic western The Three Godfathers, this film treats the viewer to some of the most watchable animation this reviewer has ever seen -- especially facial expressions, which are wonderfully done.  The lead characters, voiced by comics Ray Romano (as Manfred, a laconic, anti-social Wooly Mammoth), John Leguizamo (as Sid, an annoying, lisping Sloth) and Denis Leary (outstanding as Diego, a duplicitous Sabre-toothed Tiger) bond into a herd while attempting to return a human baby to it's Cro-Magnon tribe.  On the serious side, this film deals directly with the different sides of the predator-prey relationship between humans and animals (most touching is the brilliantly animated scene in which cave paintings remind Manfred of how his own family was devastated by hunters); on the funny side -- well, it's hilariously funny from start to finish -- witty dialog, fast slapstick, and the running joke of a non-speaking pre-historic squirrel Scrat(who fights all the forces of Nature to hang onto his prized acorn) was so strong I suspect a sequel.  Fresh, fun and evoking a wide range of emotions, this is a truly satisfying "feel-good" film that adults will thoroughly enjoy and kids will want to see over and over.  Get the DVD; the extra shorts and background material are well worth an extra few bucks.
