Dudley Moore showed us what he can do when given a good script and strong support. With Julie Andrews as his on-again off-again love interest, Moore creates a believable, if not entirely sympathetic, character: George  Webber. George is unsure of himself - after all, turning 42 does do  something to a man's self-esteem; in his case he becomes obsessed with  Jenny (Bo Derek), a fleeting vision of perfection (11 on a scale of 1 to  10). Giving way to his baser impulses George (unwittingly) becomes sexually  entangled with Derek, but realises that lust is a castle of sand. 
Blake  Edwards draws George as a rather shallow individual, prone to voyeurism and  egocentricity -  but who, in his quest for perfection, gives the viewer a  hint of our own moral eccentricities. The writing is especially strong in  the film's second half as George agonises over his lack of direction and  moral compass. His rebuke of Jenny - decrying her amorality after their  illicit consummation - is the film's highlight; stinging, yet  poignant.
Dudley Moore, for once, played a seriocomic figure with  maturity and humanity, traits not evident in subsequent films.
