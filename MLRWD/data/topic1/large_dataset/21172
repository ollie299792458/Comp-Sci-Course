TRUE GRIT
Pinnacle of the late Duke period.  I've heard the Coen Brothers are planning a remake with Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn, while the principles sound great, improving on the original seems like a tall order.

John Wayne was born to play Rooster Cogburn. The direction, scenery and writing sparkle in the original.  Strother Martin's horse trader is perfect, how can they possibly recreate his reading of the line about a child falling in a well?

Atypical of John Wayne movies is the ambiguity between good and evil.  Rooster Cogburn is taken to task (although it comes off sympathetically) for his homicidal approach to law enforcement.  He's portrayed as selfish and totally capable of letting down those who depend on him.  Robert Duvall's portrayal of Lucky Ned Pepper ranges from cold blooded opportunist (escape at the dugout) to killer with a conscience when he demands that Tom Cheney release Mattie Ross.

The only flaw in the movie is the casting of Glenn Campbell as LaBouef.  His "big bore Sharps" can't inflict near the damage of his line readings.  In spite that minor criticism this one of John Wayne's best roles.
