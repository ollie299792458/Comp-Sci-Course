My fiancee bought this for me through Amazon for Christmas. I normally would not write a movie review for movies that are obviously awesome, but God bless her heart, on paper this is an awesome collection, which it is. The problem is keeping from ruining the discs. As you're read for many who wrote reviews already, the problem is that the packaging requires you to grab the back of the disc which holds the information for the movies on both sides. This of course gets them dirty and with fingerprints all over them the more you watch obviously. Even worse, the cardboard they are encased in is  rough and scratches them each time you take them out. I think companies like WB do this so you ruin them in maybe hopes you buy them again or something? I really don't know, but they will be ruined the more you use them. If you buy this collection, get about 10 plastic cases from Memorex an store them in there to keep them away from the actual box. Shame on WB giving this to us. The movies themselves are great obviously, but don't expect them to be remastered visions or transfers, they are not. I only checked out a few of the earlier movies and they don't look remastered at all.

Because of the poor packaging, you might want to not get this until they fix the packaging, but if you do, just pick yourself up some nice plastic cases to store them in. The actual movies are good obviously, especially for Clint Eastwood fans, but keep in mind, they are pretty lame transfers and no digitally mastering has been done to any of them, bonus materials are also pretty shallow. Worth a look for fans obviously, but just consider the negatives here.
