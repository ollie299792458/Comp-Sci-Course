It seems to me that people are not relating to this movie and so they are writing harsh reviews.  This movie shows the life of a girl who feels like everything is fake in her life.  Only her friend Emily seems real. Teenagers, especially girls go through so much growing up.  With the demands of our culture's sexual expression, for us to be older than we are.  Anne Hathaway's character needed to feel something real and she had the charisma to stay safe.  Her exploits into the ghetto was in an attempt to feel something more.  This wasn't some prissy the drug dealer falling for the pretty rich girls like crazy beautiful, this movie was more real.  It gave a glimpse to others of what it is like when you idolize something ugly (living in the ghetto) to the point that its beautiful.  THis real experience with the gang was neccessary to teach her.  The life that rappers rap about isn't the kind of life that you want to live, its one you have to survive and possibly overcome to provide your family/children with money.
This movie is more than just anne hathaway naked.  This movie is for girls like anne hathaway's character, girls that are bored, beautiful, intelligent and lonely.  Girls that have found power in their sex but haven't quite found a comfort in who they are.  She feels like she has no power and so the little power she finds, she exploits.  She goes after the gang member because he is different, harder, powerful (at least in her eyes when he was wheeling the gun) and sexy because of that.
The movie is really good, but geared toward specific audiences.  This movie isn't for everyone.
