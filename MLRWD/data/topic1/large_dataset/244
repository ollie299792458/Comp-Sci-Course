Film snobs, take note: not every director sets out to make The Great American Masterpiece of Film...sometimes they just want to make a movie---something fun, that they like, that people will want to see, and will make a profit in the process.  This movie succeeds mightily.  Sandra Bullock has honed the Lovable Klutz to near-perfection, and so what if she's done it before? Nobody does it better. The script moves along at a brisk pace, and there are so many funny moments that I dare you not to remember some of them with a chuckle (or Gracie's snort.) The players blend well, with Benjamin Bratt and Miss Bullock exuding a neat chemistry. Candice Bergen----a treasure unto herself, who could carry the movie with her comedy talents alone---gamely gives support as the not-to-be-trifled-with pageant coordinator. William Shatner continues his successful campaign to make us forget he ever piloted a starship: and frankly, he's very funny as a clueless Bert Parks clone.  And then, there's Michael Caine, who can do very little wrong----here,he plays straight man (so to speak)and his efforts to make a lady out of a Bullock-in-a-china-shop result in some very funny scenes....and several quotable quotes (his wistful "One brief, shining moment...and then that MOUTH !" is a killer.) Check it out...you'll have a great time at the Movies.
