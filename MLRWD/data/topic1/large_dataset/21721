If there ever was an anime series that will leave you saying "that was outstanding," this is it.

There are so many components to this story that make it so.

The artwork is gorgeous; the backdrops themselves seem to be characters in the story.

The music, which is a mash-up of house, hip-hop, blues and jazz, adds so much depth to each episode that you may feel compelled to buy one of the series' four soundtracks just as I did.

And then, there's the story itself: two rogue warriors - one who can barely control his emotions [Mugen] and another who is nearly emotionless -- the cipher (seemingly) without a soul [Jin] -- attempt to help a befuddled teenage girl [Fu] in her quest to find the "samurai who smells like sunflowers."

Yes, similar stories have been told in many different formats for generations, but this version seems so fresh. During the 26 episode arc, you will find yourself caring about the main characters and trying to understand why it's so important for each of them to complete this ill-defined (and potentially hopeless) journey to find the samurai.

At the end of the series, you will already miss these wonderful characters. (Years after viewing the entire series, there are still episodes I will watch from time-to-time for that very reason.)

Like its futuristic companion, Cowboy Beebop, this is Anime with brass knuckles and a heart ...

In its quiet and quirky way, it's breathtakingly cool.
