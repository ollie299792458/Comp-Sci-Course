First, I love Married With Children. I love it so much I wrote a spec script in 1989 and was flown out to California to meet with Ellen Fogle supervising producer and had a pitch session to sell scripts to them. They invited my back to pitch a year later... In any case---Season 5 is the beginning of the End. Yes, it's true the "Jefferson" character is far weaker than Steve Rhoades, and I really liked David Garrison on the show more than McGinley. But that is not why Season 5 turned the show.

First it is important to note that during Season 5, original creater/producer Ron Leavitt decided he had enough leaving only Moye to stay on. This changed the focus of the show. Moye is a finwe writer but something happened during this Season that turned AL BUNDY from a REAL American Hero-Working Class Guy, into a CARTOON CHARACTER. And it happened in the episode where AL plants a Vegetable Garden and goes "Wabbit Hunting". What happened is--all REALITY for the character and show went out the window . After this show, the episodes became "dumber" "more cartoonish" "simpler" and AL BUNDY changed from a Good Soul who Sold Soles to a mean, Bully who drank beer with the guys and beat people up in a cartoon manner. The stories became too silly for anyone to beleive or CARE about (I mean--remember the episode where Bundy has to return the Library Book "Don't Bundy that Book" (a classic episode). It was based in reality. Someone could forget to bring back a book. But starting with Season 5--we have AL "hunting Wabbits" "Aliens stealing socks" (OK that episode is a classic--I admit that) and so on...each season becomes progressively more common and less intelligent while "AL" becomes less Willy Lohman and more "Wrestlemania". I will buy Season 5 because there still are some very funny episodes..but whern you get to Season 6-11? Im out LOL
