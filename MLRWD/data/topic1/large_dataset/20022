I went into this movie, fully expecting to hate it. I really liked G.I. Joe when I was a kid, had a whole backpack full of the little guys that I carried around with me. I figured they would mess up this one like Transformers did for me.... (Bubble Bee is a Volkswagen Bug!... That's why they call him Bubble Bee.... He's a Bug! He's the little guy!) but anyways...

If you were a huge fan of the cartoon, then you will probably hate this movie. They butchered the back stories of each character pretty bad. Snake Eye's and Storm Shadow's story is really awkward. It has elements of their orginal story, but still seems to mess it up.  (And that's why it loses a star) I will never understand why they can't leave characters alone in films, why must they always change them somehow?  (Cobra Commander looks like some deformed power ranger at the end of the movie)

Sorry G.I. Joe diehards. They let you down.

But with all that aside, I just really enjoyed the film. I had fun watching it. Sure there are some really hard to believe parts and some really corny parts, but I just got into that Saturday morning cartoon mode. You know the one that doesn't really care if everything is perfect. The "I got no school today and all I want to do is watch some explosions and some butt wippin'."

No it's not a great movie, but I enjoyed it.
