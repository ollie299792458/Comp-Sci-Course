OK, as a respones to all the reviews on this video b4 me...i would like to say 1st off: This saga was originally created to be after the cell saga...but b4 the saiyans fight cell at the cell games. 2nd off: broly did not have a power lvl of 645 million...it was at his max 4,100,000 and he couldnt go to ssj4...in fact he nvr reaches even ssj2...he accomplishes exactly what trunks does in the cell saga does and thats ussj or otherwise known as ultimate ssj( when your muscles get very large and u basically look like a blonde swarchzenegger).In addition the second movie titled "second coming" broly again has not accomplished ssj2 and his max power now is 6,500,000 this happens between the badidi and buu sagas.The third movie (which i haven't yet seen) Broly has yet again not accomplished ssj2 and his max power level now is 8,200,000.And this is between kid buu saga and the world martial arts tourney with uub.Now there are many sites out there that will tell u that broly was defeated by a triple kamehameha between goku gohan and goten in the First movie...but he was not, he was defeated this way...in a sense...killed in the THIRD movie. As for his defeat in the first movie, it was completely legitimate because gokus power level without the boosts from his allies was only 1,800,000 and with the allies power...it was 3,300,000 plus vegeta added another 1,000,000 with made him 4,300,000 to broly's 4,100,000. Also broly was not killed by comet kumoire.he survived the blast which was an estimated 3,500,000 strength of damage.He was only temporarily unconscious from the punch..
Lastly I'd like to make a comment about the review from the kid who said "vegeta was portrayed as a second rate saiyan"...Well for one vegeta never...NEVER..has defeated another saiyan in combat(xcept Nappa).And vegeta's power level in that movie while being a super saiyan was only 1,300,000...even trunks ssj was 1,500,000 and gohan was right behind him with 1,150,000 and piccolo had 1,500,000..Also, piccolo never had respect for vegeta in anyway..infact he often reffered to him as a " foolish man"...the only time piccolo actually agreed on sumthin with vegeta was in the buu saga referring to his sacrafice to destroy buu.which also failed. In short, vegeta ...in the movie was a second rate saiyan , atleast by the "bar that broly had set".
If u watch vegeta and goku's second battle in the babidi saga u know where i got that kind of comment from...
