This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I watch it every Otaku Friday. (Otaku Friday is a holiday my friend and I made up, the last friday of every month. We watch anime, read manga, eat pocky, and generally be especially geeky.)

The animation is beautiful. More so than in the series, even. I must admit, I'm partial to the parts where Faye is in Vincent's apartment-thing. Why? The lighting is great, and Faye's hair looked incredible. (^_^;) I'm always inexplicably amazed by how great the parade looks. I haven't a clue why, maybe it's the light; I really like afternoon sunlight. I've been trying to find a screenshot of the scene around the middle (I think) where it's just the city, looking *very* cool.

The music, as expected, was eargasmic. I especially loved the ending theme, 'Gotta' Knock A Little Harder.' The track played during Faye's first scene in the movie, 'Cosmic Dare,' was very fun, and so was 'Pushing the Sky,' played when the airplanes were flying. Also, I loved 'What Planet Is This?!', which was played during a very fun spaceship chase/fight scene.

The story was engaging. I'm in love with the whole idea, and they did a very good job 'telling' it.

I know people who have seen the movie and didn't even know that the series existed. That says a lot for the movie. It's not only good on the merits of the series; It really is great all on it's own.

If you enjoy enjoying things... You should buy this.
