After all the negative reviews I read about this movie I wasn't going to watch it, especially since I hold the original as one of my favorite classic films. My son convinced me to give it a try and to my surprise I was very much "entertained". Yes, that is what it is, entertainment, not the cure for cancer as some may seem to think. So smart and so serious, just like when some really smart person comes out and says "the book is so much better than the movie". Well here is a thought: How about if somehow we could evaluate a product on its own merits? Most of the negative reviewers here just do so because a) They think that a remake of any classic is a heresy, and/or b) Because it has Keanu in it. Well I would agree on both, if a) I wouldn't have been entertained (which has sadly been the case with many other remakes), and/or b)Keanu would have sucked (which he certainly has in other films). This was a very entertaining film, and a fine piece of work on every department: Sound, music, cinematography, directing, etc. Oh BTW, Thomas Schuehly is remaking METROPOLIS and the Weinsteins are remaking SEVEN SAMURAI with George Cloonie none other. And these are sacred pieces of art, right? How irreverent and daring. These heresists should be burned at the stake right? Well, I'm not so sure of that anymore...
