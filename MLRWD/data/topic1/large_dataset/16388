The new version of "The Haunting" is an overblown hodgepodge which doesn't do justice to the original novel. It's obvious the makers of this film went for the sensationalism route via the use of technology: the  special effects were mostly unneccesary, and, for the most part badly  conceived; (the set was too brighty ornate to be creepy!) The acting in  this movie is mostly embarassingly bad (the ludicrous script was partly to  blame)-but Liam Neeson seemed to be really completely lost. Catherine  Zeta-Jones was good as the beautiful Theo, but Lilli's interpretation of  Eleanor was tiresome and inane. Jackson's story, "The Haunting of Hill  House" is known by thousands as a psychological study of loneliness  and madness; it ain't about using millions of dollars worth of  "special effects" to bring the masses in, so the movie will reap  finacial rewards from the producer's personal gain. Phoney and contrived,  with banal elements which weren't in the book, this film is an insult to  fans of the genre, and I just hope Shirley Jackson isn't rolling in her  grave!
