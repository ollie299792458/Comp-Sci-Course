With the title Cruel Intentions one might expect a darker, edgier movie this is light fare and almost comic at times.
Poor little rich girl Kathryn does everything she can to keep her boyfriend sexually satisfied then is dumped for the virgin Cecile. Kathryns' response is to enlist the help of her step-brother Sebastian to relieve Cecile of her virginity.
Sebastian is interested in relieving the new head masters' daughter, Annette, of her virginity before school resumes in the fall. Kathryn and Sebastian place a bet on the outcome of this endeavor; Annette remains a virgin and Sebastian loses his car to Kathryn, Annette loses her virginity and Kathryn has sex with Sebastian a hitherto unattainable goal.
The usual negative aspect of having twenty somethings (Sarah Michelle Gellar/22 as  Kathryn Merteuil, Matthew Ryan Phillippe/25 as Sebastian Valmont, Reese Witherspoon/23 as Annette Hargrove, Selma Blair/27 as  Cecile Caldwell) playing high schoolers shows up.
This film does not live up to its' potential, 3 stars for the effort put in by the actors.
Trivia, Matthew Ryan Phillippe and his wife Reese Witherspoon became parents of a girl September of `99 the year the film was released. Selma Blair auditioned for the television role of Buffy the Vampire Slayer the part went to Sarah Michelle Gellar.
