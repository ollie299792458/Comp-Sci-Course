I will skip the extravagant lingo. I am not an expert movie reviewer, but have spent a lifetime enjoying movies. I can tell you that Bruce Dern does an incredible job of acting in this movie.

At 38 years old I remember my sister seeing it for the first time in the early 70's. She was moved to tears. The story that is told here is a real life example of what we have to face about ourselves. It pulls no punches about the level of cruelty and abuse that we all in some level inflict on this planet.

It is easy to put this movie down if you have no brain cells because this movie will make you think. It is not for the people that think reality tv offers substance. Those individuals will be lost.

To say that Bruce Dern is a sociopath I believe is completely incorrect. He is a compassionate individual seeing everything that this planet has to offer in the way of beauty being destroyed.

That could push anyone that is left on this planet today with a heart over the edge in my opinion. I am not a nature freak, nor one of those green peace guys. But I have seen enough clearing of rain forests and killing of majestic creatures to understand that this movie is reality.

This is a must see for everyone. The robots are wonderful. No they are not state of the art machines like those computer animated fake creations everyone seems to revere these days. But they are capable of instilling a reality in the viewer that will make the viewer feel compassion even for the inanimate robots.

This movie took me along time to come back to only because it is so riveting intellectually and quite sad overall in its message. Be prepared to feel the plight that Bruce Dern feels. Decide for yourself how it makes you feel. I'm thankful I saw it.
