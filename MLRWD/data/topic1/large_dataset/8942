I've owned this movie since it's release and I too like many others who have written negative reviews here, didn't get it. At first glance, I was annoyed by the lighting and somewhat unrealistic story. Then, after each viewing things once fuzzy would become clear. The point is not to get too wrapped up in the surface things. The dark lighting of Sincere's crib was to make you focus on how he and his girl interacted and not what was in thier house. Hype had a lot of tricks that you really need to peep. Notice how you never see the faces of the white people. Even in close you only see their mouth moving as if to say they are not really here with us. They bark orders and we stay out of their way. The acting I could defintely let slide because the people he chose all brought a very realistic "New York" street sense that is very rarely captured in film. All that being said...THIS IS A FABLE. Bunz is Tony Montana and Sincere is Manolo. This is the dream life of Bunz, the drug dealer vs Sincere's dream of not getting swallowed up by the BELLY of the beast. OX dies a death Tony Montana and Spartans would be proud of. And to top it off Hype throws in his theory (I THINK) on how Malcolm X got assassinated. This movie is a gem and by far one of the most smart, entertaining pieces of black cinema ever. Those who need their plots spoonfed, hate subtlety or seek definite truths should go straight to Menace II Society, a great movie in its own right. If you like things that make your mind work a little then enjoy.
