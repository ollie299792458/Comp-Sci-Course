How can I do any better than all the other reviews. Some a lot more elloquent and professional than I could hope to be.
 I love all of Omar Sharif's movies and I also enjoyed Viggo Mortensen's great contribution. Have to also agree with the other reviewer about the horse's contribution as well.
The music score was tremendous. I love trying to figure out who the composer of the music is and if the style compares to any other movies.
I look forward to any other productions where James Newton Howard is the composer of the music.
I have the book "Bury My Heart at 'Wounded Knee'" which was recommended to me as a good history of the Native American Indians.
I was pleased to see some familiar cultural aspects that I have seen in other places.
I could say a lot more but others have been far more conclusive on the production and actors and so on.
Finally; as I indicated in the title of this review, I get more and more thrilled to see that Region 1 DVD's CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED WITH SUBTITLES FOR Hearing Impaired folks as we are..THAT ALSO WORK ON DUAL REGION EQUIPMENT IN AUSTRALIA.
HALLMARK PLEASE TAKE NOTE!
When are we going to get parity of Subtitling in all production houses for all Regions.
Thanks to Touchstone and Casey Silver Productions for the Literally REGION FREE Subtitling of this great movie.
