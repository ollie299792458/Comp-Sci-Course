Whether you come to this flick because you admire architecture, dig Peter Greenaway, or love Rome (all of which I do), The Belly of an ARchitect will leave a bitter taste - and not just because the architect in question is suffering from a pain in the gut that makes him spew up nasty bile every now and then.

The script is a mess. What might have been an interesting conceit is tangled up in nonsense. All the Italians are corrupt (why they seem to conspire against the hapless American is never clear; if it's merely thievery, why are they so obvious?), the architect's wife is a bit dim, the architect an arrogant American without the sense to ask for an audit when his precious exhibition is being ripped off. But he must be some kind of magician: he can make photo copies even when placing the original right side up on the glass ...

Greenaway has managed to acquire amazing locations (the Victor Emaneul Memorial, Baths of Caracalla, Pantheon) and one wishes he had filled them with a compelling story; but pretty pictures don't make a movie, and this quasi-operatic tale doesn't wash. For all the talk of meat and blood, this one is as cold as cadaver.
