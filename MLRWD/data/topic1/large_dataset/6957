This has got to be one of the most "fun" movies to watch. Goldie Hawn &amp; Kurt Russell are at their best. Joanna (Goldie Hawn)is a rich aristocrat who hires Dean (Kurt Russell)who is a blue collar worker, to do some work for her. They instantly dislike each other and are like oil and water. After an accident leaves Joanna with amnesia and her husband abandons her unclaimed at the hospital, Dean, a widow, "claims" Joanna as his missing wife. Dean plans to use a confused Joanna, now renamed Annie to do all the housework and child rearing as revenge for her not paying him for the work he did for her. That's when all the antics begin! Her dislike of "her" dirty, ill behaved children turns into motherly love after numerous hilarious stumblings. Dean &amp; "Annie" begin to care for each other and it appears to be heading towards a happy ending. That is until the real husband hunts her down after his mother-in-law become suspicious of his partying and questions the whereabouts of her daughter! The ending is not unpredicatable but that doesn't take away from the pure enjoyment of this film.
