If there's a more entrancing live-action fantasy film made before "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" than this one, I haven't seen it. Arriving on American screens the same year as Walt Disney's equally peerless "Pinocchio," Korda's ravishing movie is non pariel. Stunning color cinematography; astonishing sets; the first - and in some ways, finest - film score by Miklos Rozsa; the great Conrad Veidt as a villain so archetypal that the folks at Disney "borrored" him for "Aladdin"; Rex Ingram as a deliciously devious djinn who utters what may be the most stirring cry of the pre-Civil Rights era ("Free! Freeeeee!"); John Justin and June Perez, a dream-team of thoroughly embracable lovers; that charming rotter Miles Malleson - who also worked on the screenplay - as the emotionally retarded rajah with a yen for exotic toys; a canine actor so good Pauline Kael observed that he becomes "the essence of Sabu"; and, best of all, the delightful - and amazingly beautiful - Sabu himself, emobodying all childish dreams of careless liberty. Flying carpets, wise old Muslims, an ancient and supernally gentle spirit, a terrifying battle with a giant spider, and a Persian market so cunningly recreated you can almost smell the honey Sabu slathers on his pancake. If I ever become so jaded I don't find tears in my eyes at the mischevious smile on the ancient face of the old mountain spirit as he discreetly observes Sabu's heartfelt disobeyance, I'll know I've been alive too long.
