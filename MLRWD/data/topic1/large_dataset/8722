Law student? WSOP Finalist? Stakes are high for Mike in this movie where he has to battle between two worlds: Worm, Russian Mob, Sharks, Casinos and loads of stacks of high society and that very 5th street where, knowingly and blindly you could win a hand or loose it all in a matter of seconds; or your beautiful and dedicated (yet bitchy) girlfriend for whom there was definitely NO OTHER LIFE than college's education.

Travel along an inner journey of a troubled law student who promises to quit on gambling after losing all his money on a high stakes bet with a connected russian mobster. Who starts getting along with the "regular life" when out comes his long time childhood friend to mess things up, so badly, his only way out is coming back to the game to gather enough money to pay his debts out of harms way.

Along the road, come poker friends, alot of pressure and even so often, a big can of whoopass from some cops from time to time. Thrilling and exciting from the very beggining to the very end. Bought it and watch it everynight before going out to the casino, grind out the cash from the russians around the world...lol

Peace
