Lucy (Sandra Bullock) is a single, romantic employee for Chicago's subway system.  One hopeless day she falls madly in love with a mystery man (Peter Gallagher).  There's only one problem - he doesn't even know she exists.
Then one day, she just happens to save his life and is suddenly thrown into a new life with his family, who just happen to believe she and Peter ("the Coma Guy") are engaged.  And while he is in a coma, she slowly comes to love his family.  They in turn love her back, especially Peter's brother, Jack (Bill Pullman).
I truly dislike romance movies; they're sappy, teary-eyed films of little redeaming value.  But I LOVE this one!  The humor is great, whether it be the awful dinner conversation about nothing (like my family no doubt), the well-timed jokes of the grandma, or the crazy scenes with the Super's son trying on women's shoes.  Perhaps because of the constant laughs, or a latent romantic streak I try to suppress, I must admit I always drop my *manly* facade and shed a few tears when Jack hands Lucy Florence.
Great film for the family, or to watch as a couple.  You must see this one!
