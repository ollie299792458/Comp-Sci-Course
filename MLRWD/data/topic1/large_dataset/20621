If you haven't encountered the unbelievably talented Danny Kaye yet, this film is an excellent introduction.  It moved him to the top of my list!  He sings, dances, and delivers the most difficult dialogue with ease and grace in this marvelous comedy spoof of the entire swashbuckling genre.
When we say the whole family enjoys this film, we're not saying it's a children's movie with some adult humor; we mean a film appropriate for everyone, with dialogue, characters, slapstick, and situations actually worth laughing at.  It raises your standards for all other movies.  
Same for the singing and dancing.  Not your typical Broadway musical numbers, but relevant and entertaining music.  Kaye and his costars breeze through the entire film, apparently effortlessly.  And what a cast!  You'll be amazed at the young Angela Lansbury, and Basil Rathbone delivers a thoroughly convincing and enjoyable performance as the scheming villain.
Why hasn't this film eclipsed Monty Python's "Holy Grail"?  It's certainly better.  Even the quotes are funnier (although I don't want to ruin any of them for you.)  If the film even has a weakness, it's the first 20 minutes before the plot gets moving.  But it manages to hold your attention with -- of all things -- midget acrobats until you're so involved with the characters that you can't stop watching.  
So get it, already!  You can't afford to miss this one!
