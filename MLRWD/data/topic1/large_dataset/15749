I'll rate this UMD 4 stars, as opposed to 5, since it contains just the movie without any special features, bonus material, etc. I'd give it a 4.5 rating if I could. But most UMDs I've seen are this way. It's not a bad thing.

However, this is the Director's Cut (so I'm assuming that means you get extra scenes, etc.). Without knowing the original version, I couldn't tell you what's different about it. This version of the movie is only about 95 minutes long.

The Warriors was filmed back in 1979 and tells the story of a street gang from Coney Island ("The Warriors") that spend a night fleeing from every other gang in the city. There are lots of memorable one-liners, gang costumes, and characters.

The film is based on a novel that told the story of Greek warriors trapped in Persia that had to fight their way back to their homeland. In the opening minutes of the movie, they explain this, and say: "this is a story about courage" (or something like that, to paraphrase).

I bought this movie because it was relatively well-reviewed (see Rotten Tomatoes). I can see why. It was sort of a cross between a Broadway play and an old-school fight movie. While you don't get the action-per-second and super duper special effects of a modern movie, it was a breath of fresh air to see a film like this. It sort of took me back in time.

You should pass on this film if you're expecting something modern and flashy. If you appreciate the Greek analogy, and you want to see a stylistic portrayal of late 70s urban heroes, then you'll want to give this one a try.
