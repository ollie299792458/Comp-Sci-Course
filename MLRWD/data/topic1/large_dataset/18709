First off let me tell anyone reading this. I've never seen the Anime version of the manga before buying this so it was all new to me.

Seccond as I later found out the series doesn't include portions from the manga which are supposed to be in seprate movies I later learned.

Third this series, not sure if other versions of the Anime are like this, includes two characters I don't remember from the manga and episodes which I cannot remember any manga chapters to back up either. Also differing from the manga is how certain events play out such as when Keitarou and Naru meet Otohime Mutsumi, instead of being on a ship when they accidentitly go on tour together they (Keitarou specifically) bump into her at Tokyo University aka "Toudai". Another example being the way Seta was introduced into the story and the following drama with Keitarou and Naru with Keitaro blurting out Naru liking Seta. And many more differnces from the manga, however the basic story plot is still there and for the most part resembles in essence the manga for those of you who like me only read the manga and haven't seen the anime before.

All in all though despite some disappointment with it due to the differences from the manga, which I expected thought not quite so much, it was still funny to watch and good enterainment and worth the money I spent in my opinion. Though heads up, I have yet to watch it in the Japanese language but the English audio of it the characters, are well weird sounding. Example: Mitsune Konno aka "Kitsune" reminds me of a cliche old western movie woman's voice. And Keitarou, well I don't know, just weird. They probably could of found better English voice actors is all I'm saying.
