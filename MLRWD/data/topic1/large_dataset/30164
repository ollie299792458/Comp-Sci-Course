I, like others who have written reviews on this movie, have had my fair share of crappy jobs. 5, to be certain. And EVERY LAST ONE has been in food service... God knows I'm sick of it.

When I saw this movie in theatres, I knew within the first five minutes that I'd be buying it as soon as it hit the shelves.

This movie just jumps out and grabs any who have ever walked the plank and decided to work at a restraunt. 2 of the 5 illustrious jobs (to be far, I move a lot... I haven't gotten fired) I've had so far were in restraunts, and no job is quite like a restaraunt job.

As one reviewer said roughly "the whole character development was just them moping around about their personal problems." From experience, this makes up for 95% of conversation at any crummy job. And 97% of that conversation is about their crummy jobs, and how much they suck.

This movie had so many non-stop laughs (albeit many were resulting from sophomoric jokes) that I am awaiting the DVD's arrival so I can hear what I missed from the audience laughing over other jokes. By the end of the movie, you really feel for the characters... you just pity the poor souls working a double, waiting on ignorant jerks who never tip over 10%.

If you've never been a server, or a buser, or a dishwasher, or a host(ess), or a restaraunt cook, you still might find this movie funny. But if you have worked one of the aforementioned jobs, WATCH THIS MOVIE.
