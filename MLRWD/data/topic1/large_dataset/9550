The Boondock Saints (italicize), released in 1999, could possibly be described as a "cult flick," since it never saw intense gains at the box office during its theatrical release.  However, it is a fantastic drama with both memorable characters and fantastic performances from some up-and-coming Hollywood names.

Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus star as devoutly Irish Catholic twin brothers, Connor and Murphy McManus, whose chance bar fight with Russian mobsters leads them to killing two peons in self-defense.  After spending a night in jail and being released without charges, the two come to believe they are supernaturally appointed to enact God's justice on evil men.  A virtual slaughter of vigilantism ensues, with the brothers and their new recruit, David Della Rocco, taking out all that is evil in South Boston.  When the killings begin to hit closer and closer to home for infamous mafia don "Papa Joe" Yakavetta, he secures the release of an old family hit man, the mysterious "Il Duche."

Willem Dafoe gives a smashing performance as Paul Smecker , the anomalous FBI agent assigned to investigate the mob-related killings.  His uncanny detective skills soon have him hot on the trail of the two brothers, and once Smecker realizes the particular brand of vigilantism the brothers are executing, he must make a choice to either take them down or enable their continuance.

With choppy dramatic sequencing including flashbacks and layered scene cutting, a few critics have compared the style of The Boondock Saints to that of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.  Some even write it off as a cheap imitation.  However, the memorable characters, unique humor and religious twist of The Boondock Saints ensures that it holds its own place in the line of "shoot-`em-up" mobster movies.  Don't miss out on the Saints phenomenon.
