Based on the autobiography of Ron Kovic, this heart-wrenching, painful film is so extremely well done that if it were steak it would be burnt beyond recognition. Stone's directing, for which he won an Oscar, is flawless.

In his role, Tom Cruise plays a young, ambitious, patriotic Ron Kovic, itching to serve in Vietnam and fight for Democracy and American values. He leaves behind his girlfriend and his family for a chaotic, hellish war. His platoon kills women and children. With the heat and dust muddling his vision and the steady staccato of gunshots impairing his senses, Kovic fatally shoots one of his own men. On a similar day, a half-crazed, expletive-screaming Kovic is wounded. At a hospital overrun by the dying, Kovic's last rights are administered. You can see everything on Cruise's face: guilt, pain, fear and acceptance of death.

But he doesn't die; instead, he returns home a paralyzed misfit. His agonizing trials at home and in Mexico, where he goes to recuperate, follow. And just when it seems that Kovic will never overcome the painful memory of Vietnam and many missed opportunities, he realizes that bravery isn't jumping in uninformed to the misguided war of attrition. Ron Kovic shows what it is to be a true American: to fight for the truth.
