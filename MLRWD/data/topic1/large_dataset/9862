This is a wonderful film.  The funny thing is, I agree with a a lot of the "negative" things said about the film: the car chases are overdone and not at all the best parts of the film, Jean Reno is a wonderful actor and deserved a more substantial presence, and the movie's withholding-of-information gimmick is more annoying than cute.  However, that said, I still think it's a wonderful film.  The cast is uniformly excellent, particularly Robert De Niro himself, whose incredible talent and presence is finally showcased to some measure of justice (although in general, I continue to be depressed by his other sub-par projects, like Meet the Parents, but I digress).  The story is wonderful and sharp...the endless chess games and betrayals lend it a gritty, realistic feel that has won me over to spy movies in a way I didn't think could happen (the Bond series and Mission Impossible, the closest Hollywood parallels, are just plain intelligence-insulting).  This is a thinking man's Bond film, and I truly hope we can get more, especially with the same cast and characters (or most, anyway).
