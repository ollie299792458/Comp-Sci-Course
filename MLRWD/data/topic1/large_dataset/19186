What's Eating Gilbert Grape was one of the most realistic films I have ever seen.  My favorite actor, Johnny Depp, gave one heck of a performance as the loner Gilbert, who has so much responsibility: his mentally disabled brother Arnie, brilliantly portrayed by Leonardo diCaprio, his two sisters, his morbidly obese mother (one excellent performance by Darlene Cates).  The movie basically centers around Gilbert and his dysfunctional family and all the problems they're having, and how their mom hadn't left the house for over 7 years, and how Gilbert had to work a lot to be able to feed her and the family.  Grape was so moving, just so realistic. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, however, is because the special features only have the theatrical trailer.  I thought this DVD screamed extras!  I really would've liked to see interviews with the cast, director, producer, etc, especially with Leo for his very demanding character.  I would've liked to see how he had to prepare for that role, because he was just so magnificent and so believable, so deserving of the Oscar nod.  I also would've liked to see an interview with Cates.  It's a shame, the movie was so deserving of 5 stars, I normally don't like to take stars away from something so deserving as this, if it were the VHS version, it would've gotten 5 from me...truly powerful!
