I have all of Paul's concert DVD's, I saw him on his 2005 tour but I do not know if I will buy this DVD after watching the A&E special. There were way way too many shots of the audience and the constant changing of camera angles was very annoying. I was looking forward to having video of some of the songs he had not performed before.  Instead  the TV special had endless shots of people lip syncing, dancing,hugging, wiping a tear from their cheek and mugging for the cameras, people holding up their children and even one airhead waving her cell phone around. Hey I get it, seeing Paul in concert is a very exhillarating and emotional experience. Don't hit me over the head with it. Other concert videos show the audience in concert without destroying the performance. Check out the Moody Blues Live at Red Rocks. Lots of audience shots but not this level of distraction.

 I feel bad for people who did not get to see him in concert who buy this DVD.  Unless you spend 50-60% of your time watching the audience instead of the stage,  you will not get the concert experience.  I want to see Paul and his band and keep the camera in one place at least for short interval.

Disappointed!!!
