Aside from Hollywood yet again remaking a film (I write screen plays...), the worst part of the film are it's focus on race which is an historic thing from MTV/Viacom productions.  MTV needs to stay away from movies...

The worst part of this film is Chris Rocks continued, non-funny, coonin minstrel show that he continues to put out there.  If he has a problem with his blackness, HE should deal with it.  Calling black people (...)in front of white (or in Sandler's case, white like) people all of the time is degrading.  He of course would not see it because he is collecting a check(which is all his type cares about) and he thinks that he has 'talent.'

Rock's only talent is being a self-hater.  Making fun of blacks as you routine does nothing for him.  He cooned on SNL because that is all they hire blacks for is to make fun of other blacks.  SNL is another non-funny product.  In this film, there is something racial almost everytime a black person is on screen.  I have not seen the original, but if it had all of those racial elements, then that was the way it was for those times.  It should have been removed for these times.  Watching it made me wonder if I was in 2005 or in 1965!

Rock's facial gestures are on par with Amos N' Andy.  He always plays a weak, scared negro.  CHris Rock has to be the biggest Uncle Tom out there.  He does black people a disservice with hs alleged comedy.  He is really crying for help.  There is a serious problem with someone who gets a kick out of always using the "N" word around whites and NEVER has anything positive to say about blacks around whites.  This guys sucks.

Now Sandler had some funny moments - in the first 30 minutes!  After that, this film was lame.  Nelly did a respectable job in his acting as did Michael Irving.

Overall, Hollywood - STAY AWAY FROM REMAKES!!!  Hear us loud and clear.  I glad Kong got gonged.
