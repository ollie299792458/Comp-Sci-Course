Outland has been compared to the western "High Noon", and with justification.  The plot has some very similar traits, and the ending bears a great deal of comparision as well.

Having said that, the special effects, the overall plot, and the future time frame make Outland an excellent film.  Everyone acts very well, the sets are magnificent and very realistic, and the dialog is written to cement the plot.

There are a few racy scenes, the area where workers, who commit to a year of service in a mining operation on a remote moon of Jupitor, relax.  Replete with prostitutes and exotic dancers, the men are able to enjoy some connection with the pleasures of earth.  But those scenes are done tastefully, and are very much part of the plot.

The only fault I would find with the movie is the ending.  Without giving it away for those who may have not seen it, it struck me that the 'agents' would have been more savy about using their weapons in space.

In any case I give this a very high rating, and I am certain that anyone who buys this film will not regret the investment.
