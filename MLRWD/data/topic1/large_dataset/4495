That a film "about" Callas starts with rock music should be your tip off.  The gay sub plot has so little to do with Callas: although she

was surrounded by gays and adored by them, she was essentially

confused and irritated by homosexuality.  Although Ardant is a

good actress, and occasionally LOOKS like Callas, she never sounds

like her.  I'm not sure the technology "used" in the film to create

"Callas Forever" (the Carmen film) even existed in 1977: the whole concept is cartoon-ish and

embarrassing to those of us who appreciated Callas for the supreme

artist that she was.  The money spent on this film would have been

better spent making an authentic film about Callas, or a definitive

documentary.  Zefferelli is a true genius of film and theater, but

like some other ghastly mistakes of his, this film is simply painful and

embarrassing.  All copies should be bought up and destroyed! Ardant may be forgiven for her noble attempt, but  Irons

and Plowright should have known better.
