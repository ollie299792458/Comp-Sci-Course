If you are a fan of "Planet of the Apes" this boxed set is worth every penny of the purchase price, plus more. The first film (starring Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter, and of course the late, great Charlton Heston) is one of the greatest science fiction films of all time, and could be argued as one of the best films of any genre. The social message is timeless and remains as important and poignant today as it did 40 years ago. The sequels do fall off somewhat in quality from the original, but are all still worth watching and great in their own right.

But aside from the 5 great films, what really makes this set special is the inclusion of "Behind the Planet of the Apes", a documentary highlighting the production of all five films. It goes behind the scenes and gives you a fascinating look into the making of these classics. Another great bonus feature are the commentary tracks on the first film. One is by the legendary composer Jerry Goldsmith regarding the musical score, the other is by Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter, Natalie Trundie, and makeup artist John Chambers. In both cases the commentaries are delightfully sparse, as the speakers merely highlight important and interesting details of the production, and do not ramble on like in too many commentaries.

The set would have gotten 5 stars in my opinion, but the quality of the later films in the series made it drop a point in my eyes. The later films are good films and very enjoyable, but pale in comparison to the original.
