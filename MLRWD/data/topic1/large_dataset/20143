It seems this title will be the premier release for the new "Miriam Collection" initiated by Genius Products and the Weinstein Co.  The collection is slated to feature "the best of classic and contemporary cinema...with extensive bonus materials and digitally remastered picture and sound."  Other Miriam titles scheduled are said to include "The Fall of the Roman Empire" and "55 Days at Peking".

The film will be released in two seperate two-disc versions, a deluxe edition and a collector's edition. Both versions feature a digitally remastered version of the film with an introduction from Martin Scorsese.

According to the Hollywood Reporter: "Bonus materials include cast interviews, as well as 1961 promotional radio interviews with Loren and Heston; a feature-length commentary from Bill Bronston, son of producer Sam Bronston, and historian-author Neal M. Rosendorf, assistant professor of US international history at Long Island University; a documentary on the importance of film preservation and restoration; featurettes on Bronston, Mann and composer Miklos Rozsa; and a "making of" documentary, Hollywood Conquers Spain."

The collector's edition is described as including reproductions of the original 1961 souvenir program and El Cid comic book, as well as six color production stills.

As many, including Leonard Maltin, have said, this release is long overdue but it seems it will be one of the dvd events of the new year.
