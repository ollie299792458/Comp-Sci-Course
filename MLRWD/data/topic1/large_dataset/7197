Being a fan of Harvey Keitel, I had to go with my friend's recommendation to see The Bad Lieutenant.  However, I was a bit disappointed. Having seen Resevoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, et al, I figured this one would be a good one.  But it was basically an hour and a half of pervasive drug use, obsession over baseball games, and flat dialog.

Yes, I understood the idea of him being a filthy low-life who redeems himself, but it could have been written better, and it wasn't as alarming as I was led to believe. The nun rape scene was short and not terribly shocking, and the  nude scene other reviewers mentioned was dull and bizarre to say the least.  By the end of the movie, you'll be thoroughly tired of him making noises like a goat in heat.

 Now, don't get me wrong, Harvey Keitel is an EXCELLENT actor.  I LOVE his work.  This one just fell a bit flat.  For seedy 'underbelly of society' style shock value, I'd rather pull out "Crimes of Passion", or "Kalifornia", quite honestly.  ("Crimes of Passion"'s scene with the nighstick, the cop, and the Ivory soap comment is much more vile and shocking than the nun scene here).

It does get a thumbs up for one scene near the end where he's yelling at a Jesus hallucination in the church.  It's got quite a visual intensity to it. And for the ladies like myself looking forward to the "Keitel Beefcake Factor", trust me, "The Piano" was a much better bang for your buck. Harvey can polish my piano any time!
