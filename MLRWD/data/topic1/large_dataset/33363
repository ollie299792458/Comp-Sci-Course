With the Holidays just around the corner, it's time to buy this DVD if you do not already own it. I was thinking of this the other day, when I read a research article by a family/child psycologist and in it was an off hand recommendation that every child should watch this movie regularly while growing up. I was not really surprised since I already knew this and had my own children watch it yearly as they grew.  The message is NOT sappy as is sometimes claimed, anymore than being loved and cherished by friends and family is sappy- and I am sure the researchers mentioned above would see a lot less people professionally if this simplistic message was embraced for the healthy "ideal" it portrays, instead of blown off as a sappy waste of time.

I never finish this movie without a tear or two, and an all-over feeling of joy. If, for even a few days each year, I can go about my business feeling that It's a Wonderful Life, then this movie is truly art-for it has made an impression and changed my thinking, and made my world a better place. Buy it and Savor the goodness.
