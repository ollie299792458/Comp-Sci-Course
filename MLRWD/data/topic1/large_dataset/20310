I WATCHED THIS MOVIE YESTERDAY ON DVD AND ALTHOUTH IT IS A LONG MOVIE, I COULDN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF THIS MOVIE FOR A SECOND. WOW! WHAT A MOVIE! I HAVE TO LET THE PUBLIC KNOW, HOWEVER THAT THIS IS A VERY VIOLENT MOVIE. IT IS GORY, IT IS RAW, IT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE!

  I WILL NOT GIVE AWAY THE STORY IN THE MOVIE OR THE ENDING BUT, I'LL SAY THIS: THIS IS A WELL MADE, WELL THOUGHT-OUT, WELL WRITTEN AND WELL ACTED MOVIE (ACTUALLY, YOU WILL BE PLESANTLY SURPRISED AS I WAS TO FIND THAT ONE OF THE ACTORS IN THE MOVIE, MARC ANTHONY, WHO IS BETTER KNOWN AS A SINGER, ACTED VERY WELL IN THIS MOVIE.

  MY ONLY TROUBLE WITH THIS MOVIE, HOWEVER IS THE WAY THAT MEXICO CITY IS PORTRAYED, I THOUGHT IT WAS PORTRAYED LIKE A PLEASANT, BEAUTIFUL PLACE, FULL OF GARDENS AND CRISP CLEAN AIR WHERE KIDNAPPINGS JUST HAPPEN TO HAPPEN. WELL, I VISITED MEXICO CITY BACK IN 1978 AND THE PLACE WAS, TO PUT IT MILDLY, A PESTILENT MESS. IT WAS THE UGLIEST, DIRTIEST, MOST POLUTED AND DANGEROUS PLACE I HAVE EVER VISITED IN MY LIFE. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT NOW, 26 YEARS LATER, THINGS HAVE GOTTEN WORSE!

  NOT ALL MEXICO IS A SEWER AND MOST MEXICAN PEOPLE ARE VERY HARD WORKING PEOPLE, BUT MEXICO CITY IS A SEWER AND WILL BE FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.

  BACK TO THE MOVIE - I ONLY HOPE THAT HOLYWOOD CONTINUES TO MAKE ENTERTAINING MOVIES LIKE THIS IN THE FUTURE!
