This is definitely a Hollywood treatment of an important historical era.  This movie shines in its battle scenes and its treatment of patriotism.  The colonials won this war because they were fighting for their homes and for their freedom.  In other words, they wanted it more and were willing to sacrifice more than the British soldiers.  This film shows this aspect of the war very well.
On the other hand, I am disgusted by the treatment of the main character.  If Hollywood has to have Mel Gibson play an all good man, then he never should have been cast in this movie.  When the black people working on Gibson's character's land claimed they weren't slaves, but worked on the land on their own accord, I just about flipped over.  Come on!  This was 18'th century South Carolina and land owners such as Gibson's character owned slaves in that time.  At the end, these same blacks were willing to rebuild the family's house to help "build the new nation".  Who are they kidding?  Black folks of that time had no place in the "new nation" except as slaves.  This movie is a slap in the face to African-Americans.  By the way, in case you are wondering, I am a white male.
