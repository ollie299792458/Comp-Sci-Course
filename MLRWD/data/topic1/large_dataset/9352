Butch and Sundance is an amazing wonderful film: in this ultimate collectors edition it sparkles like a beautiful jewel. The package is complete (I always thought the 1997 version was missing William Goldman's commentary - this one has it!): if you were a fan of this terrific western when it first appeared in the first flush of 1969-70 you will not be disappointed to revisit with Butch and Sundance and their hole in the wall gang. Its also a great chance to listen in again as 3 beautiful stars and countless other key personnel recount what it was like to put this wonderful film together.
God bless Geo. Roy Hill et al for making this western and changing many of our lives in the process. For this formerly 11 year old boy, I left the theater determined to be a film director. I studied writing by reading and re-reading Goldman's original screenplay over 40 times. When I finally got a chance to shoot film, of course I experimented with sepia tones!
  This is not the most coherent review I've ever slapped together but it makes up for coherence by being heartfelt. If you haven't seen Butch (and I know a lot of film scholars who haven't) you really don't know film.
  This is a classic film from several key players who have made their share of immortal classics. And the best part is, its not a bitter pill to swallow. This one tastes good going down!

note: this review is for the 2 disc version, although the special edition released a few years back is also a wonderful buy. no matter how much Butch you want in your life, they are both worthy editions. In general, anything by Redford or Newman is well worth watching (when its penned by Bill Goldman, you're in for a special treat!) .
