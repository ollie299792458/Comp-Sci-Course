IF A PERSON HAS NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE, I MUST URGE YOU TO CHECK IT OUT. THE STORY LINE IS WELL DONE, THE SCENERY IS WELL DONE. ABOVE ALL THINGS , IT WILL MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH BEN HUR WENT THROUGH DURING THE TIME OF CHRIST JESUS'S MINISTRY ON THIS EARTH. BEN HUR IS VERY INFORMATIVE ABOUT THE WAYS OF THE ROMAN GOVERNMENT THAT WERE OCCUPYING JERUSALEM AT THAT TIME AND THE WAY THEY LOOKED AT THINGS. VERY INTERESTING INDEED. ITS A LOVE STORY, AND FOR BEN HUR AND HIS FAMILY IT WAS A LESSON IN LEARNING TO FORGIVE, WHICH SURE DIDN'T COME EASY IN HIS CASE. SOME OF US HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THAT AS WELL. YOU CAN RELATE TO BEN HUR, NOT THE HARDSHIPS , THE SAME ONES, BUT IN A SENSE WE ALL HAVE HARDSHIPS. A PERSON CAN GET BITTER AS BEN HUR DID OR BETTER WHICH BEN HUR DID AFTER WITNESSING THE CRUCIFIXION OF THE SAVIOUR. THE CHARIOT RACE IS INTENSE , AN UNDERSTATEMENT. THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WE DO TODAY AND TO SEE THE MOVIE IN LETTERBOX IS AWESOME! BY THIS TIME YOU CAN GATHER I REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE AND TRULY BELIEVE IT NEEDS TO BE A PART OF YOUR COLLECTION. IT IS PRECIOUS IN SO MANY WAYS. WHEN YOU SEE IT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND. MY WORDS JUST DON'T GIVE IT ENOUGH CREDIT. A JOB WELL DONE. IT DRAWS YOU INTO THE MOVIE, SO MUCH SO, YOU FEEL AS IF YOU ARE THERE YOURSELF. WELL, THAT IS MY OPINION. IM SURE SOMEONE COULD SAY IT BETTER, IT DESERVES BETTER. BUT GLAD I COULD PUT MY TWO CENTS IN.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION.
