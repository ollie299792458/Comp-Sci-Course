I bought Nightwatch after reading many positive reviews on the internet, some even on Amazon. The film was an extreme disappointment. The movie revolves around people known as others who possess supernatural powers. The movie features a few vampires, some type of abortion-witch, and a lady who turns into a tiger. There is a guy who supposedly can turn into a bear but it is never shown in the movie. The main character seems entirely devoid of powers except perhaps his ability to get stabbed multiple times and bring down a whole movie. For the most part the movie was action-less. There were no fight scenes or scenes of suspense. The dubbing was terrible as the voice actors used russian accents that made understanding what they said difficult. The only redeeming part of the movie was a scene where the main character screams on the subway while everyone stares at him like he's a weirdo. This movie wasted 114 minutes of my life. If it weren't for me and my friends making fun of it, the movie would have been intolerable.
