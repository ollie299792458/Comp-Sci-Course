I loved this movie, as did my wife, son (a big Zappa fan), and 13 year old daughter (her first intro to Frank).  What stuck with us was the obvious affection with which he's remembered by those who knew him.  He was a musical genius with a blue collar work ethic, and a talent for creating music that complemented his musicians' special talents.  He was a rare mix.

Much of the movie focuses on that band, that band, that band........ Did a better band ever walk a stage?  Getting to watch Ruth Underwood play "Rollo Interior" from "St. Alfonzo" was such a treat.  And don't miss the special feature called "Transduce That Marimba", which is about.......... just watch it, OK?

Frank's gone, way too early, and that's a drag.  But years from now, people will listen to:

Father Vivian O'Blivion
Resplendent in his frock
Was whipping up the batter
For the pancakes of his flock

And they'll laugh, and dance, and shake their heads in wonder.  Thanks for everything, Frank.
