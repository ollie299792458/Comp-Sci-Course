I am not much of a movie person, but the Amazon reviewers could not have been more wrong about this one.  "Planes Trains and Automobiles" is one of the best movies of the '80s, but the story and events portrayed within are timeless.  Steve Martin and John Candy (one of my all time favorites) give absolutely stellar performances, and the movie is exceptionally well written.  No description can do the interplay between Martin and Candy, or the tremendously funny things that happen to them throughout the movie any justice.  One just has to see it, not just for its comedic aspects, but for the story that takes place.  One of my personal favorite scenes, delivered only as John Candy could do it, is "Doin' the Mess Around," and what it leads up to.  This phenomenal movie had me laughing hysterically, and is then rounded out with a highly satisfying ending, that stays with you and is worth thinking about.  Overall and for multiple reasons, I rank "Planes Trains and Automobiles" as one of my favorite movies of all time.  I would not say this about very many movies, but feel quite strongly about this one.  If you saw the movie when it came out, you will no doubt want to buy it to relive the journey and own a great classic.  If you have not seen the movie, buy it and you will have an undiscovered gem that you and your family will treasure for years to come.
