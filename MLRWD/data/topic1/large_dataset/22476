The Outlaw Josey Wales blu-ray arrived this morning,from amazon canada,excellent customer service by the way,right into my player it went.
Now,TOJW has always been my fave Clint western,I love Unforgiven but Josey is the one for me,only my opinion of course.
I have the dvd,in fact it,s two dvd,s of this western I have,the old snapcase and the "newer" dvd,I was more than happy with the picture quality of these dvd,s.I read a lot of reviews praising this blu-ray highly,but these reviews did not prepare me for the pleasure of watching this fabulous blu-ray!!!and it is FABULOUS,
I do believe this is "reference quality",it,s up alongside The Searchers/How the West Was Won/The Comancheros and even ZULU,and you cant get higher praise than that,imo.
It is a sheer joy to behold,sharp/clear/PRISTINE,and the audio is excellent too,I cant praise this blu-ray highly enough,BRILLIANT transfer,Warners deserve huge credit for this,KEEP IT UP Warners.
The Outlaw Josey Wales Blu-ray is what Home Cinema is all about,STUNNING Picture Quality!!!!!!!
I,ve "heard" that Warners are releasing Jeremiah Johnson Blu-ray next year,after seeing what they have done with Josey Wales,I cant wait to see Jeremiah Johnson on blu-ray.
One last observation,the Digibook is VERY CLASSY!!!!
