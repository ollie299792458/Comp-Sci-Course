I watched this film because someone I barely know saw it and told me that it's her favorite movie of all time.  Whenever someone says anything is their absolute favorite anything, it's usually something that should be looked into.  So I rented the dvd and now of course I own it because this IS a great movie.

What I mostly like about Eternal Sunshine is that it's not so idealistic like all the other movies out there.  Most films end when the relationshp in question is just beginning, but this one actually shows you the ups, downs, and in-betweens.  I think that's really important.  So many people today who are trying to meet someone think that everything is supposed to end up like it does in almost every movie you see.  That happily ever after crap is thrown out the window in this film.

The camera work, effects, and music are all really well-done, too.  I like that it's a little weird and complicated.  It's one of those that you really have to see multiple times to truly appreciate.  As for the acting, I think Jim Carey did the best job of anyone.  He nailed that mopey, slightly boring character.  I kept thinking that Kate Winslet's character could have been portrayed better by someone like Winona Ryder.  Maybe that's just because Winslet seems so proper with all those period films she's been in and all.

I'd recommend Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to anyone, except maybe people who like happily ever after chick flicks and don't like things they can't fully understand right away.
