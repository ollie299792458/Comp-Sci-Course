The Fantastic Mr. Fox combines some of my favorite things: Wes Anderson, talking animals, Jason Schwartzman and superb art direction. The first time I watched it, I was unabashedly charmed. The second time I watched it, I picked up on all the little quirks that are the hallmark of an Anderson production (such as the word "cuss" filling the void for expletives. While George Clooney and Meryl Streep were standouts, I instantly fell in love with Ash because, well, we share some of the same characteristics (I'll just leave it at that.) This movie is so wonderful, I purchased an extra copy for my 4-year-old and 25-month-old nephews. The older was entranced, and has begun to learn how to whistle &agrave; la Mr. Fox, himself. I've even found myself using the word "cuss" on a regular basis. Also, I have deep love for hard apple cider, so I was sympathetic to Farmer Bean (just a little.) As for my my nephew and me, we are still trying to learn whackbat.

P.S. Soundtrack is great for young and old, alike. Highly recommend it, as well.
