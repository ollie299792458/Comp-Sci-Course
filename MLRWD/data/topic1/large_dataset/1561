I just saw this movie and was absolutely surprised. Like so many who fell pray to the marketing, I thought Angel Eyes was some type of suspense thriller about a cop and some stalker guy. I thought it was the 'same ol' thriller'. So, I'm just watching it.
I was blown away by the depth of the characters and the acting. Jim Caviezel is my new favorite after this. I loved him Frequency, The Count of Monte Cristo and The Passion. But this movie has convinced me of how wonderful of an actor he is. He brings Catch to life through his body language and eyes just as much as he does his line delivery. It was also great to Jennifer Lopez play a different type of character. I can't recall ever seeing her play a dramatic role and was surprised at how well she pulled it off. Most of her characters are more lighthearted than this one.
Those of you looking for a great romance, give this story a try. Jennifer Lopez plays Sharon, a Chicago cop trying to cope w/ the effects of growing up w/ a father who abused her mother. Jim Caviezel is Catch, a mysterious loner and amnesia victim trying to cope w/ the car accident that altered his life forever. The two are wonderful together and create a film that will warm the heart of any romance lover.
