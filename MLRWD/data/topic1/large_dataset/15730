I consider the original Lost Skeleton to be one of the most entertaining and all around funniest movies I've ever seen.  The directing, music, characters, and old-timey special effects were all great, but it was really the dialogue that made the movie worth watching again and again.  The sequel does not disappoint in this regard at all.  It is a much different movie than the original (more different than I probably expected), with a somewhat different feel to it, but the dialogue was, once again, hilarious.  I think those people who have seen the movie will agree that, after seeing the movie, the movie has shown itself to be very funny, causing laughter in the hearts and minds of those who have seen this, that is, the movie.  I hope that Larry Blamire and his team continue to make funny movies, as they themselves have done here, with this movie, The Lost Skeleton Returns Again.  I will certainly be looking forward to watching future movies by them once again for the first time, in the future.
