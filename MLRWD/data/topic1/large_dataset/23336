This was another one of my favorite Friday The 13th. films. The original plot of Jason killng people at the camp. The mental little boy from the 4th. one is grow up and he is trying to kill Jason once and for all. He Digs up Jason at the cemmatary and tries burning Jason's body in the begining, but before he does he stabs him repeatlly with a metal pole then leaves it in Jason's dead body. A bolt of lighting from the storm hits the pole and brings Jason back to life. Tommy doesn't get to burn Jason's body after this. At the end Tommy chains Jason to a big rock and throws him into the lake. Jason doesn't die at the end. Jason is now sitting and waiting. I like the way Jason's mask looks in this film. The part with the whole paint ball game is the best. The way Jason takes care of that girls father "The Sheriff" is also the best. I give this movie a 5 out of 5 overall rating because it is a plot and actually makes sence. This movie was pretty violent, but the some parts you don't see everything that happens to people. For example the part were he kills the girl in the cabin. You hear her die then you see her thrown through a window, then Jason pulls her back in. I want to see blood. So I give this film a 4 out of 5 violence rating.
