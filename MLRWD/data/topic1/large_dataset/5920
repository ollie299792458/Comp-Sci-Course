I saw this movie when my sister rented it (because she's in love with Tobey Maguire and Robert Downey Jr) but I ended up being in love with it myself.
It's very rare for a Hollywood film these days to be this good. It features uniformly excellent performances from all the actors involved, and they all play fascinating and well-developed characters (all quirky, but still very likable.) That's a miracle in itself for a studio production these days, (I'm pretty surprised that this wasn't more of an Oscar favourite to be honest..) The story is multi-layered, the script is witty and (very subtley) hilarious, even the soundtrack is great! I haven't seen a movie like this (that I couldn't find fault with) in years!
I've since bought this movie on DVD and watched it many times (it's one of those films that you can just watch over-and-over-and-over and not get bored with.) Put simply, this is a great movie and I recommend it to anyone and everyone who appreciates great movie-making. 
5 stars. 2 enthusiastic thumbs up. 10/10. A+
