An old used-book store I travel listed several exotic silent and early film classics now thought to be "Lost".  This one author went on and on about a weird, halcyon film he'd seen in his childhood called "She", with Randolph Scott.  Imagine my pleasure to find that Kino International has just released the DVD of this 1935 fantasy.  Sir H. Rider Haggard's adventure about Ayesha, an ageless queen of a 2000 year-old lost tribe, has been filmed at least 7 times.  There were 5 silent versions(popular,eh?), plus this one, a 1965 MGM re-make with Ursula Andress, and one more sequel by Hammer called "Vengeance of She". Archivists tell us the best sound version was in 1935.  This re-telling of the story of "She-who-must-be-obeyed" starred Scott, Broadway's lovely Helen Gahagan, Nigel Bruce(remember Dr. Watson?), and pretty Helen Mack(star of Son of Kong). The director was Irving Pichel(an actor in Dracula's Daughter).  it was produced by Merian C. Cooper(from Kong).  A haunting score is provided by Max Steiner.  The film starts slow but builds to a thrilling finish.  Kino uncovered an excellent old 35 mm print, and the sound is excellent. No pops. Pick up this long lost gem, and days later you'll still remember these words..."Young and Beautiful for 500 years. And Wicked every one of them..."
