Lets see- there was Shrek, Shrek 2, THe Princess Bride, 10th Kingdom, hoodwinked, and probably a bunch more.  It's not "NEW," the whole "Fractured FairyTale" concept has been done.  Unfortunatly, it has been done better, MUCH better when compared to "Happily N'ever After" and with predecessor's like "Ella Enchanted" and "Cinderella III" it's curious why they even attempted a Cinderella based story.

Sigourney Weaver as Cinderella's wicked Stepmother has her moments, and the Backwoods Seven Dwarves did bring up as chuckle or two, but by the halfway poin, I was just interested in how the movie was going to end, but dreading having to watch the characters, I was actually uninterested in who would win (Gee, who do you suppose DOES?) just interested in it being over.

.  In all honesty, the characters are generic and uninspired.  The movie's jokes fall flat, and the movie in general isn't intersting.  amazing to see that CGI efforts from ALL studios seem to employ a HUGE cast of celebrity voices to help draw interest in movies, but Happily N'ever After" is one of MANY Celebrity flooded CGI movies that proves that even the BEST cast can't save a poor script.

This may draw the attention and admiration of the younger crowd, but it may just bore adults.  I would reccomend renting this one first.
