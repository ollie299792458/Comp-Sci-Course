Everyone calls it a modern version of Halloween. It has way more action, kills and stalking. Okay, i'm not gonna talk [bad] about Halloween or any of the sequels, but my point is that Prom Night's pace is a little better...The movie is so dark, some parts, you can't see anything but a moving object in the dark, but that makes it scary. I like how they made Jamie Lee Curtis the most popular girl in school, the girls hate on her, but she always has a comeback, and to one guy who hits on her, she replies, "Go sit on it, ape" Pretty cheesy, but funny. The explosion scene was good. I like the scenes where Jamie Lee is trying to prevent her boyfriend from getting killed, so she throws chairs at the kiler and jumps on his back, even pulls the ax out of his hand and throws it. She was great. I like how Curtis and her promdate were so close and in that scene with the flashbacks and he tells her he remembers it, very teary...Anyway, this movie gots laughs, suspense and some modest dancing sequences, gore (a decapitated head) and fluffy comedy (girl jokes)...Another great thing about it is that it's one of those "Who did it?" movies, there are about 15 suspects, it can be anyone, when the killer gets unmasked, i was in suspense as she rolled it off, who was it? Go rent it. It is hard to find for sale. Amazon.com has it on DVD. I got a good condition, pre-viewed restored edition at a video store. See it now!
