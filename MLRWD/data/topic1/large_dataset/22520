there is no gangsta movie that compares to this stuff..... it gives a PERFECT depiction of how inner city america is plagued by drug lords while it displays the bad guy watchin scarface and feelin powerful. there is a MASSIVE body count and u never know whats goin to happen next

chris rock, wesley snipes and ice T are good in this, and all of the acting is so good u will never see wesley snipes the same again hes a VERY vile person and even holds a kid as a human shield, he kills LOTS of people in this like a terminator and ice T is excellent in this movie as the cop and really has passion in his role

the drug empire in the movie is invincible and wesley snipes is too smart for authorities and NEVER gets caught til the very end, and is about to get a short sentence and plays the system. It gives a GREAT look at how cocaine damages society, how money helps warp the justice system and how difficult it is for cops.

in addition, they put 2 guys who HATE EACHOTHERS GUTS as partners and they finally unite to bring down wesley snipes, while they resort to dirty tactics to get him

the action is GREAT the lines and dialogue is EXCELLENT and the entire movie is a masterpiece
