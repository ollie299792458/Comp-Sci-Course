This is one of my favorite childhood movies; it's right up there with "Labyrinth" and "The Princess Bride."  The plot in a nutshell: beautiful beings rule in a crystal castle until an arguement  causes them to break the dark crystal which provides their power/balance.  The beings are split into two: the evil Skeksis and the gentle Mystics.  According to profecy, a member of the Gelfling race must repair the crystal  in 1000 years as the three suns align so that the Mystics and Skeksis can  again be one.  The Skeksis tried to wipe out all Gelflings to protect  themselves from the profecy.  The only two Gelfling survivors, Jen and  Kira, must find each other and heal the crystal before time runs out.  
All of the puppets are very well done.  They are lifelike and fit the  personalities of the characters.  Unfortunately, this makes the evil  characters quite frightening to children, myself included.  There is a  scene where the skeksis try to drain Kira's essence by making her stare  into a reflector of light passed through the crystal.  For years I was  convinced that if I stared at my ceiling light, my essence would also be  drained.  (However, I also thought I could access Fraggle Rock through the  back of my closet.)  So, what I really mean to say is that the movie may be  frightening to children.
The score is wonderful.  It's mystical,  fantastical, and eerie....can't say enough about it.  Well done, Trevor  Jones.
All in all, the movie is definitely worth watching.
