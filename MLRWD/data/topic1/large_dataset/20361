At first i was apprehensive about how a Sherlock Holmes mystery adventure involving a teenage cast would be.But after reading the reviews and seeing the film my entire prescriptive about this movie and what it potrays changed.This movie gives a excellent descrition of how the Holmes and Watson team would have been had the two men meet as schoolboys.The movie is both well directed and well casted with some very talented young British actors.Both Holmes(Nichlos Rowe) and Watson (Alan Cox)were brilliant all the way fitting their respective roles perfectly and filling the movie with charachter and  class although the role played by Sophie Ward as Holmes love intrest is a tad bit on the dissapointing side.However entire movie is well written,narrated and wonderfully set in typical Victorian England.It only a pity that the movie did not have a sequel especially after the brief ending scene following the credits.The music score by Bruce Brougton is soul steering and wonderful to listen to again and again.The Egyptian mystic touch in the movie adds to the intrigue and classic adventure plots.A must see for all fans of British drama and adventure and a must have for a lover and collector of Sherlock Holmes mysteries.
