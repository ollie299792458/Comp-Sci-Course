Another missed opportunity.

 I won't go into any of the plot.

You have a pretty good idea what it's about: two cousins who go on a killing spree in late '70s  L.A.

The bummer here is that this flick could have been another classic like the first Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, had they given more thought and time to developing some of the characters.

Maybe another thirty minutes would have solved it, because the screenplay itself, as it stands, is not bad at all--BUT if your main leads are cardboard, what is there for the audiance to respond to?

When will filmmakers realize that without character development you have nothing.

The kills in this flick are mindless and stupid, just as the killers themselves.

Take a look at Hitchcock's Psycho? What saves it? They took the time to develope the Norman Bates character. Plain and simple. Without it they would have had the facade of a spooky old house--and nothing more.

Why does William Lustig/Joe Spinell's Maniac work so well?

Great acting in a developed role.

Why does Taxi Driver work so well (with the exception of the tacked-on ending)? Travis Bickle, the Jody Foster character--and even the Harvey Keitel character--are all well defined, three-dimensional.

Usually a must--if you want a solid flick on your hands.
