You know...I am so sick of these "childrens" stories that have sinister stuff in them! Haunting characters wanting to eat other characters!!??!!  Gross!  There's enough garbage out there!  Can't we have a "Barbie" movie without all the "non-Barbie" crap!  Oh wait, that's right...it's got to be gross to be appealing!  So, let's pretend for a moment...I'm a Mattel person sitting at a round table discussing the next great little girls movie and I have this fabulous idea of injecting stupid characters that eat other characters!  Brilliant!!  Where do these great minds come from with these great ideas?!?  If you haven't bought it, don't.  If you have, demand your money back if you are remotely disgusted at your young daughters watching this.  Plain and simple...they shouldn't be watching.  Play a game with your child or something instead.  I'm sure you will get raver reviews than this movie from your kid.  FYI - this movie is NOT RATED!  Wonder why?????  And for those of you who ~value the music and colors in the movie~ here's an idea for you.  Buy some good ole classic orchestra/symphony CDs and play them at the same time your coloring pictures in brilliant color schemes with your child.  MUCH BETTER!  Get with it people.  These movies are NOT for young children.  If they were, they'd be RATED G!!!!
