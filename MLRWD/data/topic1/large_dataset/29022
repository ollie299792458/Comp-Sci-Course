Wow, I really didn't expect this DVD so great. I mean, I'm not a huge RHCP fan, just a casual listener. But, in terms of general rock live recording, this DVD blew my mind. First, their performance is so perfect and energetic. Especially, I like rather unconventional song selection of this live, because many of the songs show other sides of RHCP, master of not only funky rock but soft, deliberate ballads. Second, camera work and its quality is what I've never seen. The director seems to know what they're playing and adjust video to the music in a real organic way. See what editor did when flea is jumping around. Third, the Irish audiences are the part of this live, inseparable unit. I like the scene where they're singing soccer anthem all together. Even RHCP has to listen to it! In all, this DVD is one of the best live DVDs I've ever seen. Before this, I watched Pearl Jam's Madison Square Garden live DVD, but it is a real crap compared to this. Pearl Jam was really boring, song after song...and the picture quality was bad.
