Well, I watched it.  Why?  Because I love Tyrese.  I figured him being in the movie would be good, and he would be the tough, strict instructor with the golden heart that really meant well.  Plus, the kid who's in it, James Franco, he's cute too.  And who doesn't like Jordana Brewster, right?

Well.  The combination didn't work, OK?  It didn't work.  It had an interesting story about this kid who was literally from the other side of town who grew up looking at the naval academy from the other side of the river wanting to one day get in.  Jake - that was his name, right? - ends up getting accepted at the last minute (thanks to Donnie Wahlberg) and for the first half of the movie, he's a [...].  Arrogant, doesn't need anyone, pretty much by-the-book rebel kid.  After messing up in a boxing sparring match with his senior instructor (how unrealistic!!!) he gets put on restriction, has a couple of talks where people tell him "you can't get through this by yourself" and he needs to learn to ask for help...and suddenly, he's the Golden Boy.  He's helping his roommate, he's training for boxing, he's learning the credo, he's impressing his instructors.  Complete opposite from what he was before - he's even friendly.

I think that what many people didn't realize about this movie is the roommate - "Twins" - is really the star :o)

He lost weight, he finished the course, he tried to kill himself and LIVED, and decided to move on with his life.  He was Arkansas.  That was who got me through the movie.  So, he is the reason it got 3 stars....because let me tell you something.  Tyrese, in this movie, never showed his golden heart.  He is too sexy for him to NOT smile for an entire movie.

Tyrese, if you're reading this, don't do that again.
