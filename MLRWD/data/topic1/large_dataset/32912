This movie started off with a promising atmosphere which hinted at fun and thrills to come, but is let horribly down by laughable special effects, paper-thin clich&eacute;'d characters and some cringingly awful acting.  The students (blonde bimbo, geeky nerd and sincere young thing with a crush on the stereotypical workaholic prof) heading off in their jeep into the wilderness certainly had potential, but any attempts to build a creepy atmosphere of isolation is diluted and spoiled by the intrusion of the weak and pointless sub-plot about an army special forces unit battling against insurgents.  This military operation (think Arnie's team in Predator meets the marines in Aliens) gives Coolio the stage to strut his stuff. But, I'm sorry to say, convincing he ain't.  Obliged to join forces with the students, the remainder of the film is basically a series of action set-pieces in which the humans battle it out with the pterodactyls. The ensuing gore is laid on in a very OTT style reminiscent of the Evil Dead series (but nowhere near as stylish) and creates a few (unintended?) laughs.  The 18 rating is certainly undeserved too - there are far more effective and scary 15's out there.  Even as straight to DVD `B' movies go, this is pretty poor fare. The final scene hints at a sequel - they really shouldn't bother.
