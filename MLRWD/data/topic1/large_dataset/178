This is another one of those movies that proves your emotion can be evoked without any f-bombs, or any swearing at all.

WARNING: Spoiler follows.

The climax comes when, for political reasons, the Jewess Rebecca is accused of witchcraft. Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, the antagonist and supporter of the evil Prince John, had been making advances to her throughout the story, to no avail, because she was in love with Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe.

To save her from burning at the stake, Ivanhoe challenges the verdict by an offer to combat the prince's champion. To play one off the other, the prince chooses Guilbert to fight Ivanhoe against Rebecca's cause, the idea being if Guilbert wins, Rebecca burns - not exactly what Guilbert had in mind.

Guilbert, however, has a proposal for her:

Guilbert: "Rebecca. I can yield now and Ivanhoe will win by default, and you will go free. I will have to live out my life in disgrace; all this I would do if you will be mine."

Rebecca: "We are all in God's hands now, Sir Knight."

Guilbert: (Angrily) "Then prepare to die - both of you!"

A tense combat follows in which Ivanhoe is almost defeated, but Guilbert is mortally wounded in a quick turn-around of events. As he lies dying, Rebecca goes to him out of sorrow, and he says to her, "Rebecca, fate had me instead of Ivanhoe love you. God be with you always." And he dies.

I know this dialog might sound a little corny by today's standards, but I think good actors saying, "We are all in God's hands now, Sir Knight" is a lot more moving than, "[...] you and the horse you rode in on, [...]" and "Fate had me instead of Ivanhoe love you. God be with you always" is infinitely better than, "[...] you, [...]!"

But then again, that's just me.
