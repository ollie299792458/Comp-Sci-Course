Doing good for goodness sakes.  Sister prejean exemplifies the teachings of Jesus and of how Christians should live their lives by.  This movie doesn't preach, nor does it necessarily feed you a messege.  Every side is seen, and we also sympathize with each side.  We grieve the loss of a son and a daughter of the victim, and we can't help but feel saddened by the fate of Matthew Poncelete.  
It's an odd feeling to sympathize with a man who, without a doubt, is deserving of the punishment he's about to recieve.  But this movie doesn't get stuck with captial punishment issue.  It certainly opens up the dialogue for people for and against death penalty, but it doesn't swing its influence one way or the other.  We already realize his death is coming, and instead of forcing the tear out of us by making the movie the 'Hollywood' way (last minute pardon, miracles saves Matthew's life, ect.), it instead takes a spiritual path.
The movie is about salvation and redemption of a sinner, and gives hope that no one is too far gone for forgiveness.  All this, without an ounce of feeling like a Christian movie.  Simply powerful.
