Queen Latifah stars as a woman who works a dead end job in retail when she discovers that she has several inoperable brain tumors. With 3 weeks left to live, she cashes in her bank account and stocks -- and goes on the vacation of a lifetime. With little left to live for, she decides to take many risks that she would probably never have taken otherwise. Having kept a "Possibilities" book (rather than a book of things she was never going to do - as another reviewer suggested), she decides to pull out all the stops and enjoy what little time she has left!

Without a care left in the world, she proceeds to (try to) blow all of her money - and ends up with better luck and results than she ever had in her entire life. Her one intention is to live life to it's fullest! Sure some of it is unrealistic as others here have suggested. However, (A) It's a MOVIE, (B) She is going to die in 3 weeks, so she could care less about blowing money in fancy restaurants and by buying clothes she is going to wear once. Why not?

Enjoy this story as the MOVIE it is. Enjoy the carefree attitude of Queen's character and you will love this movie! If you stick to everyday thoughts of saving all the money you can and living by "playing it safe" and you will MISS THE WHOLE POINT! Enjoy this one! I rented it last week. I want to buy it now.
