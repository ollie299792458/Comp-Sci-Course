Ah, for the good old days -- like back when I saw a movie called WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING. It wasn't an especially excellent movie, but I was impressed by an actress then not previously too familiar to me, Sandra Bullock. She seemed like a sweet and disarming actress with a proverbial "girl-next-door" image. Wow, how things change. Her more recent films have increasingly turned into vanity projects of the like of TWO IF BY SEA, FORCES OF NATURE, 28 DAYS, MISS CONGENIALITY and now MURDER BY NUMBERS. This latter one is supposed to be a murder mystery, but that element really gets mostly smothered by the film's being a heavy handed angst-trip for Bullock's character. We're supposed to cheer her on as a shrewd detective, despite some erratic behavior that includes what would be called serious heavy-handed sexual harrassment of her partner if the genders were reversed. In any event, she's portrayed as the only one who knows what's going on, stuck in a workplace full of stereotypical dumb males, all clueless to what's happening right under their proverbial noses. Later she seems to show some compassion for one of the suspects, looking at him as possibly somewhat redeemable. This becomes the first genuinely human moment in the film that I could significantly buy into. But any hope of this being a plot turn that goes anywhere is ditched to still another twist. The final twist brings it back to being all about Bullock's character and her angst-trip, with the resolution of that occupying the final scene as if all else in the movie were irrelevant.
