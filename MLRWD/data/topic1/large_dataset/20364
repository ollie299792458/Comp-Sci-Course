I don't get the critical panning of this film.  It's ridiculous to expect this film to be as wonderful as the first - and I didn't.  With that out of the way, my grand-daughter (3 years old) had our first viewing this evening. I purchased the original film on DVD earlier in the week for her and she watched it three or four times (yes, she spends lots of time out-of-doors).  My wife is stuck in England due to the Icelandic volcano that grounded all aircraft.  I was kind of bummed out earlier today and went to Best Buy to look for CD bargains (came out with The Clash - London Calling).  Anyway, I spotted this sequel and vaguely recalled the theatrical release some years earlier.  I decided that buying my grand-daughter a little something was surely a way to brighten spirits stateside.  I was not wrong.  We loved it.  No, it isn't has wonderful as Jungle Book (original).  How could it possibly be expected to be as wonderful - Most of the cast from the original are long dead.  Somehow, with the exception of King Louie (a character which, by the way, has nothing to do with racial stereotyping), they managed to get the voices very close.  The story is a little more contrived that the original.  However, from a skeptic (I try to stay away from sequels that are not planned in the original story arc) and a big fan of the first film, this was pretty darn good, we loved it - and I'm sure I'm going to get to love it over and over again for some time to come!
