I am a Stockbroker with 15 years of experience.  I began my career working for a firm that was like the firm portrayed in the film in many respects. In fact, I have heard this film was based on a firm that ended up merging with the one I worked for.

The film provides a very accurate portrayal of a Small Cap firm from the late 80s to early 90s.  For example, the recruitment process was perfect.  You didn't need a resume, you didn't need an education and they didn't want people who already had licenses. They wanted raw recruits that didn't know anything and they made money on the testing process.

After you passed the test, you received no training, you got a list (any way you could) and cold called until you opened an account on what they told you to buy. If you didn't open accounts within a month you were out.  In the film, they cut off Riblisi's tie as a right of passage.  In my firm, the first time you did $1000 in commissions in a single day they cut off your tie.

Other things are realisitic as well; the fact that the firm has positions in the stocks that they sell and there is extra commission at certain moments, the Brokers all know every word of the movie- Wall Street, that they have big houses or apartments with no furniture, they drink and get into scrapes as a group, that all happened at my firm.

There are many more examples of parallels between the firm in the movie and the experiences of the main characters and my own real life experiences.  This movie may seem outrageous or over the top to some, but, it is as accurate as a movie about this subject could be.
