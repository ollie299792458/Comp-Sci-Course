A thriller that offers obvious leads to obvious ends with occasional punches direcltly to a woman's face.

The themes of the film (passion, obsession, jealousy, insanity vs sanity) would have been much better served if at least SOME of the situations or characters in this film were a BIT more sympathetic. (WARNING - there are spoilers ahead!)

Csokas' character Cleave is so one dimensional, so uninteresting, and so wooden you wonder what richarson's Stella ever sees in him.  OK - there is an underlying Russell Crowe/Brendon Frazier primal urgency that may have interested her at first.  But the man is a bore.  Worse, he's an obvious true lunatic who is said to have murdered his wife, decapitated her, scalped her, then hacked at her face like the clay he feebly molds as a failed artist.  Even if Stella had volcanic orgasms with this guy, wouldn't she have been a bit more apprehensive about continuing, and renewing, this relationship over and over and over again?

Ian McKellen remains a joy to watch.  His well contained performance is all in his eyes. A performance that begs us to question the line between neurosis and true insanity.

Ultimately the film is unsatisfying. Stella is so wretched - ultimately spacing out while watching her son drown leading to his death - viewers can only feel relief when she falls to her ultimate Hitchcockian vertiginous doom. Even here, we're reminded of what the master director knew; there is more to fear in what is unseen, rather than what is actually seen.

Though we get to watch Edgar pummel her, at least we're spared the indignity of watching him hack her to pieces.

Worth the 3.50 it's selling for on Amazon. But not with the added costs of shipping.
