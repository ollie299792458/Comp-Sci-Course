I put off watching the movie in the theater because of the awful reviews and when I finally went to see it, I seriously regretted waiting so long. Exactly what show did you people think this was based on? Over the top fashion was always a part of the show! I don't understand why so many reviewers are complaining about the over the top wardrobe. It's Sex and the City and the costumes in the movie were nothing short of stunning. Also, I love the fact that they went to the Middle East. The cinematography was breath taking! I loved the arabian nights scenery.  Did you not get enough NYC during the six seaons of the the show and the first movie? I thought changing the location was a great idea. Why not have them go some place different and have an adventure? Out of the four characters, Samantha made this movie for me. She had me laughing to the point of tears! I enjoyed the movie more than I was expecting and I honestly feel that the horrible reviews from fans and critics were way over the top. It wasn't that bad! My only complaint was the whole Aiden/Carrie scenerio. I have to admit, that was just too contrived! Overall, I enjoyed seeing the girls again and I enjoyed each persons storyline: Carrie adjusting to married life, Miranda dealing with a tyrant boss, Charlotte trying to balance two kids and Samantha handling menopause. All problems most women will encounter at some point in their lives!
