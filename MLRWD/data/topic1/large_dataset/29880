(*very minor plot details ahead*) I had the pleasure of actually seeing this movie in an actual drive-in? Grindhouse was the perfect movie for these circumstances, reminiscent of the days of old, when people watched B-grade movies at the drive-in. The fake trailers (including one that is fake no longer - Machete, which is due out in theaters in September) are excellent and all look believable. There were even old-style drive-in commercials in between the two films (although I'm not 100% they were in the regular theatrical movie-house release). That's what made this so fun!!
The first film is Planet Terror. This is your standard B-grade horror film, with insane amounts of blood, violence, and comedy as well. Rose McGowan plays the main character, a dancer, who long story short, after a mutated virus smoke thing turns everyone to zombies, Rose gets a machine-gun leg when hers needs to be amputated due to a zombie infection. Also along for the ride are Josh Brolin, Bruce Willis, Naveen Andrews (Lost), and long-time underrated actor Michael Biehn (Terminator). If you enjoy Dawn of the Dead-type movies you'll enjoy this one.
The second film is Death Proof. I'm not sure how to characterize this film. This movie comes from the always sick mind of Quentin Tarantino. Death Proof stars Kurt Russel as Stuntman Mike who enjoys driving his stunt car that essentially "death proof". He enjoys getting in car crashes and loves to kill beautiful women along with it. This movie also stars Rosario Dawson, Zoe Bell, and Rose McGowan (again). Stuntman Mike picks on these girls, but soon may regret it as the girls try to pull a 180 on him. You have to see it to really enjoy the suspense.
So, that sums up the 2 movies and I give the following ratings: All the fake trailers and drive-in stuff: 5 stars, Planet Terror: 4 stars (I liked it but it was a bit corny here and there), and Death Proof: 3.5 stars (very action-packed but just felt real long). Total grade: 4 stars (not an avg.)
