If you are a Tim Robbins or Joan Cusack fan you'll enjoy their work, because they are very good.  If you are Jeff Bridges fan I think you'll be disappointed because he's awful.  The overwhelming impression he leaves is  that he spends the whole movie screaming his lines or crying....he doesn't  of course, but watching him go through this movie is torture.  It's  impossible to understand how the director couldn't see that the performance  was horrible.
The plot is highly contrived.  One can only assume that  Jeff Bridge's character must not have a clue about the subject matter that  he teaches because everything catches him by surprise.  That would be more  believeable if the main character wasn't supposed to have spent  considerable time studying this stuff.  But then given the plot all  semblance of logic and reason is thrown out the window about 10 minutes  into the movie.  The movie veers from creating a subversive, paranoid  vision of suburbia to a car chase laden, fight scene action movie.  And the  "punch in the gut ending" plays out in ridiculous fashion as it's  only patently obvious what's happening and yet no one takes any action.  Two stars for Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack and the first half of the movie.
