2010's "The Expendables" was directed by star Sylvester Stallone. It was a fun movie. For "Expendables 2", Stallone moves over(he's the star), and the director is action-veteran Simon West. More fun. "Expendables 2" did only $84 million in the U.S., but overseas ticket sales broke $300 million. Can you say No. 3? "Expendables 2" offers our noble, grizzled action stars re-united by Mr. Church(Bruce Willis) for what looks like an easy plunder-paycheck(They think). A new rookie member is gunned down right in front of the group, and an angry quest for revenge leads to a series of bloody confrontations. Tough-guy Chuck Norris shows up in the middle of the movie for a violent battle, filmed on what looks like the Warners' back lot. Chuck Norris promptly kicks everybody's butt. "Grandfather" action stars also include Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, and Dolph Lundgren. In one scene, Schwarzenegger demands a rocket-gun being held by the big black man. The big dude says: "You better not mess with my gun, or you'll be terminated". Not missing a beat, Arnold says: "You should be so lucky..."West shoots on location in China, Hong Kong, Louisiana, and The Devetaki Cave, in Bulgaria. A light-hearted adventure, "Expendables 2" is lots of inside jokes and huff-and-puff humor. DVD extras include Blue-Ray 1080p hi-def, and DTS-HD Master Audio. The DVD is a beautiful anamorphic transfer with 5.1 Dolby Digital audio. You also get commentary with director Simon West, "Gods of War; Earth's Anti-Action Heroes" featurette, "Big Guns, Rise of the Action Film" featurette, "Assault: Real-Life Weaponry of The Expendables" featurette, "Guns for Hire" featurette, Deleted Scenes, and a Gag Reel. Our ageing band of "tough guys" all fare well. All except, perhaps, Governor Schwarzenegger. In so many scenes, his hair is fluffed-up and messy! He looks like he just got out of bed with the maid. Bang. Bang.
