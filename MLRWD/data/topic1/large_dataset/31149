The basic story here is of a young lady who has a bad case of vanity and then comes to understand what really matters in life - she learns to see things in a new way.

This movie is both set in the past and also is present day - it is both very silly and profound - its kind of b-movie-ish yet really beautiful in its message that it tells. I've noticed some people here complain somewhat about the second half where it gets alittle serious. But that is part of the wonderful balance of this story. It needed to take a break from the comedy alittle to show the sincerity and soul of these characters.

Simply put 'The White Dragon' is a wacky & wonderful movie that doesn't take itself so seriously. Cecilia Cheung and Francis Ng are good together - watching them is a real hoot!

So, for all those who missed the point of this strange but fun movie and think badly of it, i would suggest to lighten up and give it another try!

'White Dragon' is just a very cool - kind of different movie.
