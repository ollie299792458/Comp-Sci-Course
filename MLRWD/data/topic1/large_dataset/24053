I've never seen a movie where the reviewers don't realise they are talking about themselves as much as the movie... Watch it and see which group you fit into, ie whether you have any affection for the world around you, or whether you evince your misanthropy with prolonged gurgling criticisms on websites. At risk of sounding pugnacious, what's not to like about this film? When younger, I'd get together with some mates and make crap short movies. There was rarely a plot, never a script and it was the most fun I've ever had... especially the moments when by pure accident you'd stumble on some cheap but brilliant 'special' effect. And sometimes, the final product would surprise everyone. 'Be Kind Rewind' is about that fun and that surprise, which I think is unique to film as a collaborative medium. This film actually tries to show you something important... Contrast this to the majority of Hollywood's output, which boils down to narrative cliches in support of a marketable gimmick.

This may not be Gondry's best film whatever that means, but his integrity as a film maker is well intact and I don't think I've experienced such visual flair since Jacques Tati's Playtime.
