Sean Penn is amazing in this film.  While there are some similiarities to Dustin Hoffman's style in "Rainman," it doesn't take away from Mr. Penn's acting at all.  The little girl in the film is breathtaking, convincing, and just down right adorable!  
I should warn you, if you don't like to cry or don't like schmaltzy type films...don't waste your time.  But, if you are the sensitive, compassionate, emotional type who loves to just sit and watch two tissue box type flix!  This is one to see.  
Michelle Pfieffer is completely disconnected in this film. Mark my words...that doesn't mean she didn't do a good job...rather, she did an excellent job because that was what was required of her character.  Her character is cold, calculated, frazzled, and disenchanted.  She's a terrible mother struggling to understand why her son hates her... well...she's a terrible mother!  Her character is disconnected from life and Ms. Pfieffer does a supreme job getting this across.  She is a pleasure to behold as she grows and gets a clue!  
Mr. Penn...what can I say.  He made me experience his anguish right along with him.  His characters need for routine is disrupted on many occasion and the resulting emotions were sometimes too much to bear.  Kudos to him and his talent.  
Not for everybody - but if you like films (not movies) and your mind, spirit, and heart are open to new ideas, perspectives, and you like to see True Love conquer all (Did you like The Other Sister???) then this is a movie for you!
