Let me make one thing clear: If you plan to buy this movie, get this version.  The added scenes occasionally offer a glimpse of how they might have made this movie better, if nothing else.

Frankly Nemesis is a movie that worked a lot better when seen on a massive screen in the theaters.  It's got what is easily the best and most intense starship battle scene of the TNG movies, and for the first time shows off just how amazingly powerful starships really are.

Unfortunately, this was the high point of the movie.  Most of the movie's plot and dialog could be described as a loosely strung-together batch of obscure continuity references and lines borrowed from the television series.  All the character development that they did with Worf on DS9 and Data in the movies seems to have been conveniently forgotten in order to try to capture the feel of the TV show.  It hardly does this very well, though, because the main story is hampered by a series of almost embarrasingly fan-boyish action sequences.

The other dissapointment was the fact that this movie was supposed to be the one where we finally learn more about the Romulans.  Unfortunatley we are shown absolutely nothing new, as the story is entirely focussed on the new race, the Remans, who have apparently been slaves and front-line troops for the Romulans for millenia.  One can hardly fault the writer for taking this easier way out - the Romulans have never been given enough in depth attention for us to learn that much about their culture - but it's dissapointing to see this missed opportunity.

Despite the flaws, however, there are some moments where the show really starts to shine through.  The first conversations between Shinzon and Picard are interesting and thought provoking, as is the underlying theme, but both of these seem to have been shelved to allow more time for the final battle. The result is a lot of fascinating build up to something that is never properly resolved.
