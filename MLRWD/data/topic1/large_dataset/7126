I first saw Miracle Mile back when it first appeared on VHS.  I remember that the theatrical preview for it revealed very little of what the film was actually about.  At least I think I remember it that way.  Anyway, as I watched the film, and its plot became clear, I prepared myself for a bummer ending.  How delighted I was when the end came!  It was nice to see that writer/director Steve De Jarnett had the backbone to end it the way he did.  And now, something like twenty years later, the ending is still as timely, and as scary, as it ever was!  Main disappointment:  The DVD is not letter-boxed!  However, the film is still a frightening blast and remains one of my all-time favorites of the genre.  Anthony Edwards is sympathetic as the poor sap who picks up a ringing pay phone only to encounter the most horrifying wrong-number caller in history.  Mare Winningham is also fine as his love-interest.  Although the film's budget is obviously not enormous, DeJarnett's innovative direction, and the film's good acting and sense of mounting tension, overcome all technical quibbles you may have.  Just a wild, scary ride for anyone who likes the everyman-thrown-into-an-extraordinary-situation type movies!  Check it out!
