This is a dvd well worth waiting for. All racing fans will enjoy the ragged roar of the engines to the side love stories. DVD picture is crisp and the color is beautiful. Only word of caution: there have been some DVDs sent out missing their inserts. Currently, Amazon will accept returns but that doesn't solve the original problem nor get the DVD set into your hands. If you find you're missing the insert, I think our only recourse is to contact Warner Bros and ask them to send it. This happened when Dune was re-released this year, but Universal promptly took care of the problem by sending out the inserts. Hopefully, Warner Bros will do the same. I am going to try my luck in doing this. Will update this review to let you know if I was successful! Update August 14: I sent an email to WB re: the insert problem. The WB customer contact person advised me that the insert featured the Jim Russell Racing School. Jim Russell was the technical expert for the film. Although this insert is available on a limited time & supply, WB was very gracious in sending me an insert. It has some nice b/w pictures taken behind the scenes. Thank you WB!
