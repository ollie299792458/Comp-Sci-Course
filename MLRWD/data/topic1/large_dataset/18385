If this movie was written by a teenager dealing with angst it would be brilliant. But unfortunately it is a very modest effort on the part of Daniel MacIvor, a grown man.  
The charcters deal with pointless issues as though they were life-shattering decisions and all of them are shallow to the point of being totally unbeleivable.
The town of Wilby seems only to be occupied only with the characters with dialogue - all of who are cliches and this gives the film a stage-play feel to it. This is odd because plot and character devices from both "American Beauty" and even "Jaws" are easy to spot.  The main stars, Paul Gross and Rebecca Jenkins generate a kind of anti-chemistry with every other character in the film, especially Ellen Page whose performance as the smart-but-misunderstood-diamond-in-the rough is laughably bad.
Callum Keith Rennie is the only stand-out in a movie that is otherwise amateurish in many ways.  The only thing it gets full marks for is being recognizably Canadian by way of low technical quality and numerous plot holes, instances of poor acting, poor casting and childish outlooks.
It is important to support Canadian film, but not by abandoning critical judgement. This is not a good movie.
