Strangers is 'Hitchcock lite.' It's a very well-constructed film, with good performances (Walker's is the best as the decadent, charming villain Bruno), but it has dated badly. Basically, it can't operate as a thriller today. Even on the first viewing (and especially with subsequent ones), there is never any sense of danger generated, which is a crucial flaw in a film from the master of suspense. There is never any doubt in the viewer's mind that the terminally dull hero will emerge from the film unscathed, even when he seems about to commit a murder. In the film's time, maybe audiences were more easily taken in, but today, Strangers can only be appreciated for its art; its visceral effect is a sad casualty of the jadedness of the modern audience. Films like Psycho and The Birds still have the power to frighten us, but there's nothing of that scale going on in Strangers. Still, it is fun to watch, but in its case _the viewer is the one in control_, picking up on and considering its symbolism, and nodding at the finer points of the performances - whereas in Psycho, Hitchcock is the one in control; he has you by the throat the whole time.
