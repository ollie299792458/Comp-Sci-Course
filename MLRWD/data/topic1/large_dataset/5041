Back in 1997 when the Spice Girls ruled the charts 2 years after what I like to call the Ace of Base era and before the boy/girl band/group era, no could ever imagine the girls being in a movie. But that is what people got and even now 7 years later, it is still a fun ride if not a little outdated.

For anyone who remembers the phenonom that was the Spice Girls, you can not but conjure up some thoughts (let them be negative or positive) about their rein. Their music was catchy and when listening to it in this day and age can bring a person to a calmer time in life.

If you grew up in the latter part of the 90's you cannot fullly appreicate this movie no matter how hard you try.

The reason for this is that the movie just has no plot. I will agree with everyone else and say that this movie is completely pointless. But that does not make it a bad movie. It actually makes it more of a golden treat.

Cashing in on their popularity, this movie was made by mixing the girls, fictional characters, aliens, nostalgic and outdated jokes (by todays standards) and complete nonsense. It does it all in a clever formula.

The most rewarding part of the movie for anyone though has to be the first time you see the girls faces. You remember them in your head, but when you actually see them on screen for the first time in 7 years, you can not help but to admire their beauty for several minutes on end. They look great. Posh is still hot, Baby is innocence done right, Sporty is still a cutie, Scary is still scary in a good way, and Geri just looks fine.

Overall, this movie is a great way to spend a hour and a half on a weekend esp. if you want to go back a time when everyone was happy. Literally.
