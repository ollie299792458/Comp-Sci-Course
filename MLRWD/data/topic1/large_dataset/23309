That just don't make movies this good these days! Take the trinity of great film personalities who make this beautiful,

lyrical tribute to Ireland a film classic! Duke Wayne with the

redoubtable Maureen O'Hara as his screen love.  The directorial genius of John Ford with an ensemble cast for the ages! Maureen

has several of her brothers in the film, Ford includes his older brother and great character actors such as Ward Bond and the

inimitable leprechaun Barry Fitzgerlad add to the fun! Victor

McClaughlin is also outstanding as Maureen's brother who loves

to fight, eat, carouse and cause trouble!

  The simple story concerns a retired boxer who returns to the land of his birth. He falls in love with O'Hara and despite complications all ends well!

  The real star of this movie is the beautiufl west Irish countryside where the film was mostly shot by Ford.

  The Quiet Man is a wonderful film for the entire family to enjoy over and oveer.

  Maureen O'Hara and Leonard Maltin enhance the fun with their

commentary on the making of the film. Excellent!
