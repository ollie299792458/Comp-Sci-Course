I can't portray how much I dislike Ryan Phillippe, but in this movie he shined as the anti-Hollywood hunk everyone wants him to be.  He needs to stay on this route.  McQuarrie has created two of the best characters I've ever scene on film.  Parker and Longbaugh are two men that are bad and never, never make excuses or come to realization that they'd live better lives if they stopped being bad.  This is unheard of when it comes to anti-heros of this relaxed film noir genre.  Usually the anti-heros find by the end of the movies that what they've done is wrong and you pity them, but Parker straight out says that they do not regret what they've done and they don't want are pity.  This type of character seems to be a new one that I would call an anti-character.  Absolutely revolutionary.  Now if you're not going to watch Way of the Gun for the characters than at least watch it for the opening sequence which is the best way to start a movie that I've ever seen.  It's so outrageous and over the top that it's shocking and funny.  It also sums up what kind of guys these are that you're actually dealing with.  There are parts of the movie that drag a little which is why I had to take away the one star, but overall this is a great, overlooked movie that should be taken very seriously.
