I found this DVD to be enlightening and thought provoking - particularly in spuring further discussion and investigation into the "science" of evolution and ID.  Unfortunately, there are many scientists who don't like the conclusions because of their own predispositions that only serve to hinder the advancement of scientific knowledge.  In reading the various reviews, I found J. Taylor-Bullocks comments particularly thoughtless and illustrative of this sloppy process!.  The statement "True scientists do not make claims just to support their own views and or opinions." belies an igonorance that I can only hope is not transferred to the student.  As a physicist and educator at the graduate level I have ample experience in observing scientists doing a whole host of things to bolster their pet theories and protect their positions within science.  Many are leaders in their field (unfortunately).  My advice to the KY reviewer would be to go back to school and learn what objective science is.
