You must be kidding me...Henry Rollins as a military man? Thats funny!

Henry would crap his panties if his alphabet cereal just happened to spell out the name John Wayne by mistake. I love his music but the guy is a total zoom-dweebie. I mean he has the intelligence of an empty can of bean dip...Anyway...

This movie isn't anywhere as good as the first movie. It starts out with good gore (woman being split in two)but then they try to develop the characters and that is where the movie becomes boring since you still never give a shite about them anyway and that is where the yawns started to come in. It gets to the point where the only reason you continue to watch it is to see them all die horrible deaths and to the film makers credit he actually almost comes through (with a couple exceptions).

The first movie had some great acting with intense scenes,great gore and story telling,and this sequel tries,but lacks everywhere except the gore (and even that was so-so compared to the original). With that said it does have its moments and thats why I gave it a two out of five stars which means you should only pay two dollars out of five for this direct to dvd sequel.

However,with that said you do get to see (((spoiler)))

Henry spew his pablum in bloody red goodness and that always deserves a five out of five star rating.
