I'm going to keep this review short, because the movie really wasn't that good. Fantastic Four is the latest in a saturated market, and it fails in almost every aspect except excellent special effects. The characters are cliche, as is the bad guy. The dialogue is repetitive (usually about either loving or hating their powers). The action is sparse and over way to quick, and the ending itself was cheap. And the ending is both predictable and clipped, with the super heroes coming together for one final blast of an attack to defeat their foe. Then, of course, there was the "monster egg" ending, that left you wanting more. Only in the case of this movie, it really didn't leave you wanting much. In fact, it solidified my personal want to quickly eject the DVD from my DVD player and return.

I can't recommend this to any kind of movie lover. Some of you out there who enjoyed the comic books may find something worth watching here, but I would never recommend buying this DVD, as it is a waste of money, especially when there is so many other choices out there. Rent it or borrow it; if you enjoy Fantastic Four, then consider buying it.
