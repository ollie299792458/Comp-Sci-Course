Comment: I was not expecting to like this movie... only wanting to check out the technical aspects such as the "stop motion" and 3D qualities. This movie was so well done, with particular attention to the details that I was blown away (in a good way). After I watched the "extras", again I was blown away with the tremendous amount of work that goes into making one of these stop action movies... it is incredible. The story and the situations became spooky... (button eyes), and may be a little intense for younger children. For "mature" viewers... whether you watch the 3D version or "normal" version, I think you are in for a pleasant surprise.
3D Performance: The 3D was "stellar" on this disc. As good or better than at the theater. Most Blu-ray 3D discs have a problem with "convergence" best explained as "stereo ghosting" to objects in the background. It can be as little as 2% up to about 20%. This movie was absolutely perfect. This is the disc I am now using for my "golden master" of 3D perfection. I am now asking: "If they can do such a perfect job on this movie... why not all 3D movies"?
Disc Performance: This disc performed perfectly. No aberrations of any kind (audio, video, 3D or skipping).
