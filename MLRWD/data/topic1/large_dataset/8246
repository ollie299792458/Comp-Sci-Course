I loved the movie.  Granted that I would have seen the movie to watch Hugh Dancy alone, the acting was superior.  I loved watching this story unfold and look at the world of regrets and mistakes.  I am not on my death bed, but I think we all look back and wonder about that one pivotal day.  As Dickens points out in Great Expectations, we all have one day which will alter our lives forever.  This one was the one for Ann.

Claire Danes was outstanding.  I didn't realize until later that she and Patrick Wilson were in a commercial together.  I enjoyed Harris' character but failed to see what it was about him that made her think of him as the love of her life.  Then, I bought the book.

The book showed many levels which were either omitted or cut in the movie.  The marketing for this one should have been different.  It was to me as good as Streep's Bridges of Madison County.  I walked away feeling like I could turn around and see the film again.  But the trailer leaves you with the impression that something is going to happen which doesn't.  Therefore, while I understand some reviewer's disappointment; I did love the movie.  I have plans to purchase it upon its release.
