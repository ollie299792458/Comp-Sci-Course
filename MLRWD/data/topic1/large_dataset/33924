"Before Sunrise" is a realistic dialogue of two college aged young adults that meet by "chance" on a train in Austria/Germany/Hungary.  Ms. Delpy is the one of the romantic leads, paired with American actor Ethan Hawke.  Her role as the emotionally mature and aware young woman on holiday, finishing a visit with her grandmother, is not only refreshing, but should send EVERY young man's heart aflutter.  Ethan Hawke is the young man, that has just finished a disasterous meeting and break-up with his American girlfriend in Europe, and aimlessly "bumps" into Ms. Delpy's character on the train.  After an initial meeting, that realisically portrays the most charismatic scences of love at first meeting, the couple spend the next 90 minutes developing not only their characters, but the most sincere
portrayals of feelings ever seen on film.  A real sleeper.  Though eight years old as a movie, this movie's emotions, intensity, and realism shall never age.  Definitely buy or rent this movie.  E-mail me and tell me what you think.
