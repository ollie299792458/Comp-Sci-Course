I have 2 words  JAMES SPADER.  This largely under rated actor's portrayal of Daniel Jackson has created my favorite character anywhere.  Intelligent, disrespected by his colleagues and peers, Dr.Jackson exudes a quiet dignity, secure in his knowledge that he is correct in his theories--but never arrogant or cocky.  I dont know if that was the way he was written or if that is Mr. Spader's spin on him,  but he slays me.  I would do him in 2 seconds. He is a mixture of good looks (GREAT hair), intelligence and perhaps a little bit of nerdiness, but when the going gets tough he can hold his own, shooting aliens and conversing with the locals in their native language.  But the best part for me is that he respects women, in his own way.  When presented with a "comfort woman" he immediately declines her "offer" and then gets to know her, develops a friendship with her and when it becomes apparent that the society in which they reside consider them "married" and she feel badly that he rejected her initially, he is man enough to do something about it.  SIGH!  My perfect man--next to my husband of course.
