Nicholson plays a superb role of a person who is overly intelligent compared to his girlfriend, who obviously seems to lack his apparent smartness. The movie, as such, starts out as high-versus-low-IQ conflict that is portrayed  brilliantly. However, she does not share his suffering from a low self  esteem. Her character is most beautifully played, and shows very  sympathetic character traits - the first scene when she sings in  the car and when she comes to the family and makes big efforts to be nice, are examples.  The family provides a stereotypical setting of a "gifted persons" environment, while lacking some of the heart warmth that Jack's character's girlfriend radiates. I  should know, I grew up in utterly similar circumstances, I had a similar  girlfriend once, and I once ended up doing something similar to Jack's character. Apparently, Jack Nicholson really had an affair with the actress playing the piano player in the movie and fathered a child; the subcutaneous tension between them can be felt. The  movie blew me away, and it keeps doing it. The atmosphere vibrates, but one needs to be  awake when watching the movie in order to catch the subtleties of the film as mostly, intense emotions are somewhat packed up.  There is true blue humour that lies in the accuracy of rendering contrasts.  Practically speaking, this movie is a must buy. Do not try to watch this  movie in a cinema, once would not be enough anyway - buy it and live with  it at home.
