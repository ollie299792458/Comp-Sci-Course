The #1 greatest racing movie ever made, Grand Prix was a very experimental film using brand new camera angles, new technologies, great story telling, and incredible insight into the greatest form of motorsport. Sure any jerk stomp the gas and go in a straight line its not about the driver its about the car, and you can teach a child to drive in a circle like those redneck NASCAR wimps. F1 is what driving is all about - the DRIVING not the car, not the TV exposure, not the fame - just pushing yourself as hard as you can - lots of turns, lots of shifts - driving because you love doing it. In this particular time period (late 60s) all the cars were rear mount engine rear wheel drive, 2.0 litre V8. Itdidnt matter who made it that was the league limit. Matching all the cars to see who was the better DRIVER. 
INTERESTING TO KNOW: this movie was the first to every use split screening views. Also, this was made the last year the Formula cars were privately owned by the car manufacturers. After this corporate sponsorship ruined the sport.
