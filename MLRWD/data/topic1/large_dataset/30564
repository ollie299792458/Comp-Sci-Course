The ironic thing is, this movie was trying to point out peace and discrimination issues, and being made in 1961, led to an era of peace and anti-discrimination battle cries. This movie is in retrospect, the best musical of all time. With its deep mysertious characters and chaotic plot, the movie keeps you gripping your seat til the dramatic conclusion. The Puerto-Rican sharks vs. the manhattan raised Jets take you once again back to the time of when gangs roamed the dirty side of the cities. the plot (William Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' brought to a new time period and light) revolves around the characters of immigrated Puerto-Rican Maria, her sister Bernardo, his girlfriend Anita, Maria's given lover Chino, Her real lover Tony, who's best friends with Riff, who's the leader of the Jets. With a rumble following a community dance where Maria and Tony first meet, the leaders of the Sharks and the Jets, Bernardo and Riff, are knifed and killed. Overcome with emotion, Tony, who killed Bernardo after Bernardo killed Riff, wants to turn himself in, and finds himself unworthy of Maria's love. Chino has Bernardo's gun, and a bullet he intends to use on Tony. Maria can't see the hate, she wishes to love everyone and everything. But taking sides involves hate unfortunately, and love is stuck in the middle of it. The movie comes to an end with Tony being shot by Chino, and Maria finally gets the message out to everyone: Hate can cause so much sorrow, why do people even hate? The movie has many brilliant dance and song numbers, and a deep, revolving plot. The fast paced number America ("Things are all right in America! If you're a white in America!") brings latin spirit and is a simply amazing seaquence to the film. Winner of 11 Acadamy Awards, more than any musical has ever won, this movie clearly states all over it that it is a true classic.
