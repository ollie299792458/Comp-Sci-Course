I watched this movie on my own once, and then was so amazed at its energy that I sat my roommate down in front of our tv, and he shortly proclaimed it as the best revenge movie he had ever seen. And honestly, it really is the best revenge movies could ever ask for. Most revenge movies structure themselves with the protagonist being wronged, and then setting up the rest of the film as a journey to one day find the antagonist and have revenge, usually in a single scene. Here, however, it was deemed one revenge wasn't enough. Instead we see multiple engagements across the entire movie, and as a result it delves into a darkly comic, intelligently written, and extremely well-acted movie. Several scenes still amaze me (there is a taxi cab fight scene that is just pure awesomeness), and the music is very well incorporated, and never intrusive. At times it surpasses the 'Revenge' genre and becomes an intimate game where the cat may not be the cat, and the mouse may not be the mouse. Also to note is that the gore and brutality in this movie puts any Saw movie to shame - it is depicted graphically, and realistically.

Anyways, watch this movie if you're not afraid of violence, and want to watch an intelligently put together revenge film.
