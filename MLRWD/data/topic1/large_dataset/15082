I didn't read the book and I didn't grow up in the south with a black maid or babysitter. My comments are only about my reactions to the movie.

I was drawn in to this movie immediately. I like to learn about new things, and as I was watching it, I realized that this is a topic that I really know very little about. Most movies that cover the 60s in the south focus on the civil rights struggle, extreme racism, hatred, and politics. This felt more like dropping into the day to day lives of ordinary people. People just don't talk about this kind of stuff. Either the drama of the lynchings, church burnings or Martin Luther King take center stage, but these types of stories are very important too! They helped to inform my view of a segment of society (both black and white) that I just have never had any connection with.

I felt the love of the writer, director and actors in bringing this story to life. It seemed that they wanted to give it a feeling that only being in MS could create. It felt like a tribute to their past, their history, and the important people in their lives. It wasn't perfect, but it was compelling. It left me wanting to go deeper and know more.
