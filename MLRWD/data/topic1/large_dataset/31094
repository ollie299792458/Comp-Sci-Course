One warning: if you are a big fan of Terrance Stamp or Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith in the Matrix movies, this will be somewhat of a shock.

Stamp plays a transsexual, Bernadette, in this wonderful Aussie movie mourning the loss of her husband, by taking up an offer taken up by Weaving's character, a drag queen, to do shows at a club that, we later learn is owned by Weaving's estranged wife. To add to the two is an obnoxious young man, another drag queen, played by Guy Pierce.

As the club is quite a distance away-and they cannot afford to take the trip by airplane, they end up buying a bus they nickname Priscilla, Queen of Desert.

Along the way, they encounter all sorts of characters and events, including one where Pierce's character nearly gets killed by homophobes.

But the real fun is in the costumes they wear. Deliciously over-the-top and flamboyant, and often worn while lip-synching to cheezy disco tunes, they bring even more color to the story.

One warning: this is a Australian movie, so often the characters engage in dialogue filled with incomprehensible slang. You might at times need to watch the tone of the characters speech to understand what, exactly is said (often sexual in nature)

But if you don't mind that, and how strange it may sound to hear Agent Smith talk in an Aussie accent, be my guest
