This is a beautiful film leaving the viewer uplifted, and with a renewed sense of hope.  An Egyptian Police Ceremonial Band, played mostly by Palestinian actors, ends up in the wrong town on their way to an Arab cultural center opening.  As they emerge from the bus, they are in a remote Israeli town, with no bus out until the next morning, no hotel in town, presumably no other Arabs in town, and essentially no money.

The band is led by a very stiff "General" who is now forced to depend upon the kindness of strangers in looking after his charges, until the next bus out of town the next day.

Although it could have been a mindless comedy, the film takes a very serious approach to character development and depicting the interaction of the two cultures, resulting in many intensely humorous moments.

All the main characters are touched by the meeting of these two cultures and groups of peoples, and changed by it in positive ways.

The movie's humanity and love characterize it, and give us all hope for greater interaction between Arabs and Israelis along a similar vein, allowing such a recipe to emerge again, and again.

Bravo!
