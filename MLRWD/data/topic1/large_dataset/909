Duel is one of the best psychological thrillers ever. It is a clear cut act of what might go through someones head when they are alone in a car. Once the Dennis Weavers character make a harmless move on the road he is plunged into a game on the road that is not as far fetched as you would think. Meaning no harm when he passes an eighteen wheeled tanker truck he has the truck retaliate on him by passing him back up and then the game is on. Stuck in a hot dessert and being the only two on the road most of the time is the best stage to show how men on the road can break down to a primal instinct of kill or be killed. The cat and mouse game turns back and forth so many time through out the film and the best thing of it all is that the truck driver is never reveled.
The way people act on the road when they are behind the wheel is different then the personality that they show everyone in normal situation. This could be the first case of road rage that has been shown to the world. It is a film that is so far ahead of it's time for most Americans did not hear about road rage until the late eighties or early nineties. The way Steven Spielberg told the story from just Dennis Weavers voice was a stroke of genius
