By far the best screwball comedy ever made. Cary Grant is hysterical as a stuffy professor commissioned by a museum to solicit a donation from a wealthy widow; while he is doing so he meets a madcap heiress (played by  Hepburn) who falls for him - and she just happens to be the widow's niece.  The film is side-splitting from start to finish and features great  performances from some of the best of the 30's character actors: May Robson  as wealthy Aunt Elizabeth (you'll love the way she fumes over Grant and  Hepburn's antics); Barry Fitzgerald in a small role as half-drunken  groundskeeper Fogarty; Walter Catlett as the scatterbrained Constable  Slocum; Fritz Feld as a psychiatrist; and especially Charlie Ruggles as the  good-natured but incredibly loony Major Horace Applegate (from the time he  steps on the screen, he'll have you in hysterics).  The lion's share of  praise, however, goes to Grant and Hepburn; this was one of Hepburn's first  screwball comedies and yet her delivery is so fast and furious, you wonder  why she didn't make more in this genre.  Grant is superb as usual as stuffy  Professor Huxley (his inspiration for his performance was silent comic  Harold Lloyd).  My favorite scenes include the restaurant scene, when  Hepburn tears Grant's tuxedo jacket, and he in turn steps on the back of  her dress and rips it off (that scene seems to demonstrate how, in an  offbeat way, the characters are made for each other); and a hilarous  supper-table scene with Grant, Hepburn, Robson and Ruggles.  I really don't  understand why this film didn't attract depression era audiences in droves,  it's terrific escapism guaranteed to make you forget your troubles and  laugh for a while.  Guaranteed to stand up to repeated viewings - I've seen  it at least 20 times and I still haven't gotten tired of it.
