This film was my favorite baseball movie until "61*" appeared, but it's still a classic. Some really great performances, but the chemistry is what's outstanding. There are some weaknesses, but this film pretty much defines synergy -- it's greater than the sum of its parts. 
The Costner/Robbins commentary is great fun, in part because Costner isn't afraid to open up and criticize the pitfalls of the movie-making process. His descriptions of the deleted/alternate scenes leave us longing for a 20th anniversary edition (should there be one) that could include them. It also would have been great to hear Susan Sarandon's comments. The guys clearly hadn't seen the movie in a while and there's quite a bit of genuine laughter. Early in the commentary, Costner says something like, "If weren't not careful, we're just going to sit here and watch this thing." You get the impression that he's drawing Robbins out and helping him to become more comfortable -- remarkably like the Crash/Nuke relationship by the end of the film.
If the deleted/alternate scenes would have been included, I would have given this edition 5 stars. Regardless, it's worth owning.
