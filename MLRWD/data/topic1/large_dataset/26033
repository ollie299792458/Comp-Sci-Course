This movie itself is a hockey classic, and is a sports movie along the same lines as "The Replacements" and "Major League".  
The plot is simple, the Chiefs are a losing hockey team, and the teams existance is in jeopardy as attendance is low, and the local mill is about to close.  We are quickly introduced to a colorful assortment of charachters, and as the movie progesses, we learn the story of these charachters more so than in other similar movies.
Over time, the teams player-coach, played by Paul Newman, schemes his way into several plans to help the team win, increase attendance, and actualy stay in business.  When the cheapwad owner hires three goons (The Hanson brothers) the action really picks up, and the team begins playing very agressively.  They start to win, and earn the attention and loyalty of their fans in the process.  
Overall, there is a lot of crude, low brow humor, but this movie does it well.  You can easily get suckered into thinking you are actually watching a season of a minor league hockey team.  The movie is indeed inspired by actual events, at least many of the charachters and situations.
Special features inclue production notes, the original trailer, and a feature commentary by the Hanson brothers.  This is one of the best parts of the special DVD, and it was one of the best feature commentaries I have seen in a long time.  After watching the movie a few times, it is definitly worth checking out.  And this movie is one that you could watch over and over again, especially if you are a sports fan.
