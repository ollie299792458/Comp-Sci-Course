So the critics and public had the long knives out for Cohen on this one, and it's been a bloody mess ever since.  Regardless, the movie is outrageously funny, and I had to pause it several times because I was laughing so hard I couldn't watch the screen.  Are there bits that don't work that well?  Yup.  Does it matter?  Nope.  What he manages to pack into this insane road show is so multi-faceted, fearless to the point of insanity (don't even ask about Bruno's adventures in the Middle East), and demented, you won't believe your eyes.  What's shocking is how the staged scenes with Bruno's assistant (and would be lover) Ludtz are so involving and, when Bruno rejects him, so unexpectedly serious and affecting.  Cohen is an authentic talent, but the combined forces of industry jealously and homophobia torpedoed this picture at the box office.

I just read some of the * reviews, and they're unintentionally hilarious echoes of a scene in the movie where Bruno puts together the worst pilot in the history of television and then goes face to face with the focus group that hated it.  American Puritanism is alive and well and silly.
