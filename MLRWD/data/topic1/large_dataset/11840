1) Why does Kayne West song appear which was produced 10 years after the Gulf War?

2) After a Marine is killed during training, the instructor is going to be investigated.  He is going to be out of a job, at least for a while.

3) There is a hell of a lot of homoeroticism.  Also, all if not most of the women are seen as unfaithful and useless. This aspect of the film is very questionable.  A lot of [...] references, we know it's going on....but OK enough already.  Men do it, but we aren't very proud.

4)  I wasn't in the Gulf, but I know that there was shelling for 30 days straight prior to engagement, constant, constant, constant...day and night.  I've heard that it was sickening.  I didn't see that in the movie, but maybe because of the Marines location I could be in error.

This movie is like the Thin Red Line.  It is not strong but it wants to illustrate a statement about the suffering of War from a single perspective.  The statement that I like is that the military is not pretty, the life of a private is and can be very, very stressful.  In hind sight, most people for whatever reason, minimalize their military experiences; this movie succesfully portrays the agony that a typical private must endure.  I was not in the Gulf, but in the IRR released out of the US Army at the time. I could identify with the stress and the immediacy of wanting to be identified for your efforts.

The fact that War shouldn't necessarially be glorified is, I believe, the goal of this movie.  This seems to be War at a realistic viewpoint.  This movie is meant to be a follow up of Full Medal Jacket, the synsicism and humor is there.  Some of the personal practices and beliefs are stretched.  The fact that the Gulf War was a huge success is captured and that is a welcome benefit.
