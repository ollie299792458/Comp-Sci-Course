There are so many reasons I love this movie.

First, it's a romance, well several irreverent romances, some bawdy, some not, and not all totally realistic, but why do we like fiction anyway, for the realism?  Not.

I'm a fan of the happy ending, and there are several, but there are also logical (believe it or not) and satisfying endings.  Overall the movie resonates and stayes with you long after it's over.  Love Actually is an upliffing way to spend an hour or so, and it gives you the feeling that life is well worth living no matter how crappy it can get at times.

There are wonderful messages to be learned about love, and not just the man/woman type, but about love and loyalty within the family unit, and in assorted types of friendships as well.

The line up of actors and actresses is awesome--there are some of my favorites of all time, and some new kids on the block who we'll certainly see more of in time.

Many of the situations are a hoot. You'll laugh out loud every time you watch it, and you'll watch it often, I promise.  One of the best.  A classic for sure.
