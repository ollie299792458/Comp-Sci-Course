This movie has got to be one of "THE" scariest, creepiest, funnyiest movies ever filmed.

As a kid this movie scared the heck out me and many, many other kids(and adults). The Zuni Fetish Doll from the third story, Amelia, is still scary even today.

This was BEFORE Childs Play, Puppet Master, Dolls,etc. They all came after this, and are scary in their own right of course, but this was the first.

Karen Black does a great job in all 3 short stories and the first two, Julie and Millicent and Therese are good as well.

The transfer from Dark sky is ok but could have been better. Maybe they only had so much to work with. They did a decent job. The commentary by Karen Black, William F.Nolan, and Richard Matheson were a nice touch.

I wish Dark Sky had behind the scenes information about the Zuni.

Come on Dark Sky, we want to know this stuff! :) Nice job though.

Anyway, the movie is a classic and everyone should see it.
