"Libeled Lady" is one of Jack Conway's best films! This film shows you just what "slap-stick" comedies are. Myrna Loy & William Powell are especially delightful, but none-the-less, Spencer Tracy & Jean Harlow make their presence known. Tracy plays an editor who allows a story about Loy's character, claiming she is a homewrecker, to be published in his paper. After realizing a mistake has been made, he quickly tries to fix his error but things don't go as planned-instead he ends up with a five million dollar libel suit, that Loy's character is determined to see destroy Tracy's career & paper! Tracy then sets out to find Powell, an ex-employee, to help him straighten up the mess he's made. To make matters worse for Tracy, we find out his fiancee, played by Harlow, has decided she is tired of waiting around for him and gives him an ultimatum-marry her or they're finished. The story takes a lot of turns, all proving to be very amusing. This films shows us just how funny Tracy can be, proving what a terrific actor was. Jean Harlow is entertaining as Tracy's fiancee, full of sarcasm. This film must be added to your collection!
