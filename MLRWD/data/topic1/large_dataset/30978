It's odd, isn't it, that the best-known, best-loved feature film made by Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy was a story of childhood, based on an operetta about "Babes in Toyland" and full of wonderful, natural-acting children. It's an odd coincidence because throughout their career, Stan and Babe (Ollie's real-life nickname) were often referred to by characters in their films, and even fellow Hal Roach employees, as "The Boys."

There was indeed something childlike about the big, self-important Ollie, who always tried to boss Stan, and became peevish whenever things went wrong; and the vacant-eyed, amiable Stan, who couldn't understand why Ollie got so upset with him all the time. This movie fits them like a glove. The Victor Herbert songs, while simple, have a heart-breaking beauty about them (think of the songs from "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and you may suspect you've found where Walt Disney got the idea for those tunes and lyrics). The comedy sequences are uniformly well done and funny (especially those with Stan and Ollie, but the others, too). And it's amazing to think that Henry Kalmbach Brandon (Barnaby) was just 21; Charlotte Henry (Bo-Peep) just 20, and Felix Knight (Tom Tom) only 18 when the film was made. It was a child's movie in more ways than one!

Like some of your other reviewers, I well remember the first time I saw "The March of the Wooden Soldiers," on TV in the early 1950s as a child. It struck such a chord with me that I almost cried with happiness (sounds corny, but it's true). And the one thing I always regretted about the movie was, it was made in black and white.

Now I have a VHS of the colorized version, and it looks just as I had imagined it would look, lo those many years ago when I first saw it at Christmastime.

Thank you, Boys. You left all of us a marvelous legacy.
