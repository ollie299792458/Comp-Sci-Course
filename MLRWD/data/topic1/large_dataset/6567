I have to admit that I was skeptical about seeing this movie.  So skeptical that I even waited for the DVD to be released.  After watching the movie, I decided it was an entertaining film.  I have long been a King fan and the movie was more palatable than other less successful books to film translations.  The movie at times actually gave me the willies so to speak.  It is the tale of a classic space monster movie that used current phobias and fears regarding the nations water supply being a vulnerable point of attack for a biological terror.  The acting was adequate and the actor that plays Jonesy in the movie did a great job.  The special effects were surprising and exceeded my expectations.  Are there many scary moments in the movie?  An occasional few.  I would consider it more gore ridden than a traditional thriller. It suggested links to Langoliers and Stand By Me (based on the novella The Body) for long time fans of Stephen King.  I would suggest this movie if you are a fan of the genre but if you prefer the more sentimental King movies like The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption you will be disappointed in this film.
