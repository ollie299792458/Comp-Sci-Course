This ain't it. As a junior in college when I first saw this film in 1968, I found nothing to relate to except the the Simon and Garfunkle soundtrack. It contained nothing else of the philosophic, political, or styleistic revolution erupting all around me. True, it was an indictment of the moral and cultural vacuum of capitalistic conformity carried over from the fifties, but such an indictment does not in itself make a canonical sixties film. Watching this movie (on DVD) for the first time since I saw it in 1968 only reinforced my original luke warm impression. That even a seriously gin-soaked Mrs. Robinson would waste her considerable seductive talents on a big nosed dork fresh out of college seems even more improbable to me now then it did in 1968. The reaffirmation of true love won over by relentless stalking is still nauseatingly Hollywood formula trite. True, the acting is impressive, but in the final analysis can't really carry the premises or the overwrought pretentions to serious social commentary.
