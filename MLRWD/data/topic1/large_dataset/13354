I am not sure why everyone thinks it is so noble to not give spoilers up here, when I *have* to in order to rebut this movie's "amen corner". Apparently folks think it is OK to go beyond believability if it is in the cause of making a sad occurrence even more emotionally depressing. This girl was in magazines and had thousands of people waving little Irish flags and chanting her Gaelic slogan, AND she was horribly injured by an obvious cheap shot that horrified all - yet she has no flowers in her hospital room? No fan mail (by the bagfull) of encouragement for Clint to read to her? Why did the champ win and not get DQ'd for that act (after a very angry warning and point penalty from the ref)? Did Tyson beat Holyfield with that bite? Maggie tells her redneck relatives and their podunk lawyer to pound sand - then asks to "go" without her own will? Who do you think gets the purse money in that situation? When a heart monitor alarms, it also alarms at the nurses station. I saw the nurse tell someone she was going for coffee so yeah, she was gone but it sure sounded as if someone else was still there (?). The acting was superb and I will certainly be pulling for Ms. Swank to get her second award, but Clint has to take some heat for not insisting on cleaning up the screenplay. As famed director I am sure he had the clout to do so. It's funny, I just saw "House of Sand and Fog" last night and I found it to be a better movie that didn't get a fraction of "Baby's" hype.
