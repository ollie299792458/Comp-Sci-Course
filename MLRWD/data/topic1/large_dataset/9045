I first viewed this movie in 1987 only because the cover intrigued me so and sparked my curiosity of what could this movie be about. But also seeing who starred in it also sparked interest being a fan of Rourke and DeNiro. Let me first point out this movie is NOT for the squeamish. So if some graphics disturb you than you should pass on this. The movie takes place in 1955 New York. Harry Angel a private gumshoe is contacted by a law firm representing a one Louis Cyphere. Reason for the contact is that Mr. Cyphere wants to hire Mr. Angel to find a client of his who he needs to collect on a "vague" debt. The client he wants found is an old crooner by the name of Johnny Favorite or aka; Jonathan Liebling. After Mr. Angel contacts one of Johnny's old doctor up in Poughkeepsie he winds up dead. Harry reports back to Mr. Cyphere that he is out of the hunt as he could be a prime suspect. Cyphere baits him with an up front $5000 salary to find Johnny Favorite. You have to remember $5000 is a lot of money in 1955. This gets him on the track down to New Orleans looking for Johnny Favorite. In his searches everyone he comes in contact with who had any dealings with Johnny Favorite they wind up dead with Harry Angel being pointed as the prime suspect. This is as far as I can go with this as I really don't want to spoil this for anyone. All I can say is buy this movie because the ending is worth the price of admission alone and will shock the hell out of you and you won't be able to stop talking about "Angel Heart" for quite some time. I highly recommend this one. Not hardly a sleeper film.
