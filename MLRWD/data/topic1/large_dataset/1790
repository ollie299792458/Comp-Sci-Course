After reading a lot of reviews for this film I was amazed at most of the latter reviews which bash this film. Obvioulsy those reviewers are stuck on American horror films which tend to deal with less story and cinematograhy and more on flat out T&A and violence.

Keep in mind this movie was released back in 1977 so the effects weren't nearly as good and to a "true" fan of the genre should not be as important as imagination, creativity and suspense in which "Suspiria" delivers in all 3 catagories. Simply put if you are more into American horror movies then you should probably not watch this film.

The recent reviews before mine are typical of those who enjoy "slasher films" (typical of the early 80's I.E. "Friday the 13th" (1980) or mid 90's flicks like "Scream" or "I Know What You Did Last Summer" I'm not taking anything away from those films as they're fantastic in their own right. "Suspiria" is a matter of taste and opinion. There is no middle ground, either you'll love it or hate it. I am one that loves it. I would recommend this film to those who either 1) Love the Italian Giallo movies or 2) have an open mind when it comes to different horror styles.

If you feel movies like the above mentioned "Friday the 13th" and "Scream" are the best of the genre (You have a lot to learn) and you should NOT watch "Suspiria" it's not for you.
