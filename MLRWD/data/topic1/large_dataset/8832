Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is one of my favorite animated films. it is, in my opinion, an essential film to watch or own for any fan of the modern Batman series. the story has amazing depth, as do the characters, and the dark knight is quite possibly seen at his very best.

however, the DVD release of this wonderful film is quite disappointing. I owned the VHS prior to buying it, and hoped that the DVD would be an improvement, but it really isn't. the video is in no way re-mastered and has quite a bit of noise, as though it was sourced from a VHS tape. the only reason I gave this release 4 stars is because of how much I truly appreciate this film. sadly, I don't think it is likely that there will be a re-mastered release of the film, but in any case this will do, since I really just want to be able to watch it and not worry about degrading the media every time I do.

if you're a batman fan I suggest you buy either of the two DVD releases; the keepcase is $2 more, but aside from being in a different case, the items are identical. I spent the $2 extra because I prefer having a keepcase and think it's more aesthetically pleasing, but there's no qualitative difference.
