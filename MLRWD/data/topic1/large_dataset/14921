Let me start by saying; this film was part of the soundtrack of my youth back in '72,73.  Curtis Mayfield was and is one of this country's greatest social, protest songwriters ever. He also had a special musical groove which connected with both Rockers and Funksters. Along with bands like War,Santana, Malo, Mardrill and Osibisa,we had one hell of a good time growing up listening to the music. In addition, we never delt in drugs, but we sure as hell dressed like the main character, Priest. However, this was also a time of racial and social unrest, and there was alot of racial gang wars going on in certain High Schools.  My friends and I grew up in an era where we were bused and integrated into High Schools located far away in different neighborhoods. These locations were not the original High Schools we should have gone to. Furthermore, being latinos, we were not about to let ourselves be pushed around by anyone, not by Whites or by African-Americans, and so as a culture or as a group, we banded together and through shear courage and audacity we earned the respect from others. I make no apologies for those days. It is what it is. Moreover,the music from this time period is timeless and classic. If you grew up in this era, I would highly recommend that you purchase the music on this soundtrack.
