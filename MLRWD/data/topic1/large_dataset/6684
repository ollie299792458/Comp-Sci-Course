Adaptation was the first movie by Charlie Kaufman that I have seen. It is an amazing film I must say, as you see the lives of two diferent brothers, twins to be more precise, and the way they face it. It is mostly about adapting to the many things that happen in life. It develops this idea by showing a bald, fat Charlie Kaufman attempting to adapt a book to the big screen. Although the story is far more complex than this, as it places diferent characters in a variety of situations, it show how dificult it can be for someone to change life, to adapt to it. As it happens in the films of C. Kaufman, the story always leave room for many thoughts. You will find yourself having a great time during the film, with its twisted plot, that keeps coming and going through time, and also feeling sorry for a Charlie that seems to think his life is a miserable mess, and therefore doing very little to change it. It is surprising to me, how Kaufman is always able to show diferent aspects of human life with such as smart touch, and to leave his own perspective of the subject. This movie is as clever as his last work, "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" and should be seeing with an open mind. The story of the book adaptation is very interesting, but secondary. What really is amazing about it is how the movie goes in one direction when C. Kaufman is trying to adapt the book, and when he asks his brother's help, which changes the movie completely, turning it to a all new direction. That is something extraordinary. And also pay attention to how all the characters "adapt" or change during the film and why they were forced to do so. This is a must see film for anyone smart enought to realise that they too need to "AdApT".
