I just read the previous review, and it's very incorrect. Which leads me to believe that people don't pay enough attention to this movie... and it should also be watched more than once. I'll admit, the first time I saw RIPLEY I didn't like it that much. It was okay... but long and strange. But after seeing it a few more times, I wanted to own it and show it to everyone. Obviously, from the report above, people miss important things. Because everything people have stated WRONG about the move is unture. For example, the above questioning of why reporters weren't around and why police weren't wary... well, all that was in there. Just forgotten about because it's such a long movie. Have patience. Don't watch it on a night when you know you're not in the mood to think and take in everything. You really need to get into the mindset of the character - and understand why he does what he does. Otherwise you'll be like me the first time and think it wasn't worth the few hours. AND NOW I OWN IT! :)
