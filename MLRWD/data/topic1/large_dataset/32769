I have come to really love the TV show "Haven," with all it's "Troubles" (the supernatural gifts/curses, depending on the "affliction" & your point of view, some of it's townsfolk possess).  It's a great mix of the supernatural, suspense, humor & so much more. FBI agent Audrey Parker's  struggle to find out about her past, & where she comes from, is at the core of everything (for me). As one questions seems to be answered, another pops up. As wonderful & complex as that part of the story is, it gets even better with the addition of Nathan (her, "troubled," Haven PD partner & the one person she can truly trust), Chief Wuornos (Nathan's dad & the sarcastic Chief of police), Duke (the local smuggler, struggling with his own issues), &  the quirky Teagues brothers (Vince & Dave, who run the local paper, who seem to be a couple of town gossips, but have a LOT more going on beneath the surface). It's a wonderful show & I've enjoyed watching the 1st 2 seasons on TV, am very glad to own the 1st season on DVD & can't wait to get my hands on each new season, as they are made available. KEEP THEM COMING!!!
