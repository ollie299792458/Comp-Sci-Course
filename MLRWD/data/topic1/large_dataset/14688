After seeing this film in theaters I went out and purchased the novella upon which it is based.  While I was fascinated by the film, the book is far superior.  Rather than being a family man and scientist attempting to cure the virus, Neville is an ordinary man who takes it upon himself to kill as many of the infected as possible.  Ultimately he realizes that the creatures he hunts are not necessarily evil, but that there has been a paradigm shift:  humanity has "evolved" and he is the evil "legend" unmercifully killing those that are normal.  I found that version more compelling as the Neville portrayed there more closely resembles what I believe to be the average American male.  Also, that version of the story is significantly more intellectually intriguing.

While the alternate version contained in the DVD/HD DVD/Blu-ray version is different in several ways from the book, in ways that I will not mention so as not to spoil the book for those who have not yet read it, I think that it contains that intriguing paradigm shift theme around which Matheson based his story.  Obviously Hollywood is going to take creative license with a film in their adaptation, but if they would have instead released this "alternate version" in theaters I think that they would have had a more successful film as it would have well adapted the story to make it more exciting while retaining the intellectual elements.  Well, at least they included it on the DVD!
