I first saw this phenomenal work on TV many years ago in an edited, sanitized version. When it came to VHS I bought it and watched it hundreds of times with many friends. I have to first say that the character of Michael is any actors dream to play. His emotions go from A to Z in a matter of two hours. And Kenneth Nelson, who portrays Michael, and also starred in the original cast of "The Fantastiks!" is nothing short of brilliant!  Personally, I think it was his best role and his life cut way too short. It was a very smart casting move to use the stage cast. They are all very comfortable with the material and I cannot imagine another cast. I am so thrilled that this is comming out on DVD and has been restored by William Friedkin himself. While it is true that homosexuals are no longer so self loathing, it is also true that this is a valuable piece of history that we should never forget. Leonard Maltin wrote in his review of this picture that......"It is the only time in movie history where one tiny claustrophobic set can be one of the films biggest assets......" He was right. This film works on all levels. Well directed, acted, and written. I simply cannot wait until November. Great extras only enhance this gems worth. My only hope is the 'lost' scene of Larry and Hank upstairs be restored. Buy this picture. It really is worth it.
