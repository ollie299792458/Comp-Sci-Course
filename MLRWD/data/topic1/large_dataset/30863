Largely based on actual events taking place during the reign of King Louis XV, Brotherhood of the Wolf is an 18th-century-era tale of the mysterious "Beast of Gevaudan" that left a trail of mutilated victims (mostly women and children) and spread wholesale terror amongst the peasants in southeast France before its eradication under somewhat mysterious circumstances.
In the film, King Louis XV assigns a young detective Gregoire de Fronsac  (Le Bihan) and his partner Mani (Mark Dacascos), a Mohawk Indian to investigate the mysterious creature.
