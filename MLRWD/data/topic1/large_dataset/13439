The Whole Nine Yards is about an unhappy Dentist, Dr. Nicholas Oseransky (Mathew Perry), whose married to a horrid wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette),  whose new neighbor, Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), is  a hit man, who just got out of prison.  What Nick doesn't know is that  almost everyone wants someone dead, including him.  
Bruce Willis, like  in the Sixth Sense gives a great performance, without doing much.  Mathew  Perry is the best as the comic Dentist, and his reaction faces are very  believable. Michael Clarke Duncan (Who started filming shortly after The  Green Mile) gives another perfect performance as Frankie Figs, another hit  man in the way. Amanda Peet has some great scenes as a hit man wannabe.  In  fact there are no slackers in this cast.  The film comes off great and I  really enjoyed it.  It was much better than I expected
The Whole Nine  Yards is a very clever and entertaining film, with a great score.  It's a  real winner.  I was happy to add it to my DVD collection.  I recommend you  see it.
