It's funny.  It's smart.  It's not bad.  Instead of one person playing a trick on another and having all of that one person's friends knowing about it, in thismovie, we have tow.  It's a delightful little twist from what you expect to get.  Kate Hudson looks just like her mother and plays a perfect seductress turned who knows what.  Matthew McConaughey is perfect in this role as stud, but supreme ladies man.  Each seems like the bets they partake in, but true love shines through for both and there is an ultimately happy ending.  It's got a great soundtrack, and even a great, though terribly, awful rendition of You're So Vain that had me in stitches.  The appearance of Marvin Hamlisch was unexpected, but I was disappointed that we only got to hear a intro to "One" from his undoubtedly most popular show, A Chorus Line.  Kate is hilarious.  Matthew and his friends are typical guys guys in movies that you love to hate but hate to love that just give in to women every time.  It is very entertaining and I give it a high recommendation.  HILARIOUS!
