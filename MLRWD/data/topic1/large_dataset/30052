If you are a fan of this character, then don't hesitate to purchase this complete set in chronological order ASAP. You won't regret it.

I've been a fan of the Incredible Hulk since I was a child and this TV series has contributed a lot to it.  Even thought I also liked the last two movies based on this character (2003 & 2008), I like the Kenneth Johnson's Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno version better because it is more human (literally) and believable.

Dave Bruce Banner is a doctor/scientist who tries to reverse his accidental overdose of gamma ray to go "back to normal" and, even though he is not perfect himself, tries to do what is morally right in the different situations and places he encounters.  He is not proud of becoming angry; however, some times he is pushed to become angry and purposely tries to become angry as fast as possible in some life threatening situations where there is no time to keep the cool in order to "save the day".  David knows that he (himself) needs the Hulk to come out and take charge in a matter of seconds in some situations.  In other situations he just simply gets so angry that triggers the Hulk-out, even though he tries to keep the cool.  By the way, the Hulk-out transformations are much more fascinating here than what the recent CGI movies have offered.

I'm enjoying these interesting episode plots and the outstanding performances by Bill Bixby and Jack Colvin (Jack MacGee the newspaper reporter who wants to find out where the Hulk comes from).

I don't give this series more than five stars because there is no more stars available here at Amazon but if there were, I would.

I recommend it very much.
