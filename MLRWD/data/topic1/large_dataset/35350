The Song of Bernadette is perhaps one of the most impressive and stimulating stories any family can view, study, and ponder together. It is a story of Faith, even for those who had lost faith due to adverse esperiences in situations where positive actions were met with negative outlook by others who should have been giving encouragement.
Miss Jones is magnificent.She is steadfast without seeming to be stubborn and self-centred. The standard of behaviour she exhibits in face of the severest attacks from several directions enables us to take a closer look at ourselves,our lives and our situation in an environment, wherein those who are placed in positions of leadership and trust tend to undermine us at every turn. The essence of the story and Miss Jones' performance will help us to withstand the forces that are often set against us when we seek and strive to do what we believe to be reasonable, right and directing us to our destiny. But most of all, it strengthens us and our faith in the Almighty God, and makes us believe the unbelievable.
