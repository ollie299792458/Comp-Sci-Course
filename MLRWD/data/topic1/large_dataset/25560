I'D NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE, BUT REMEMBERED HEARING ABOUT IT WHEN IT CAME OUT WHEN I WAS A KID, SO I KNEW I WAS TAKING A CHANCE BY BUYING IT ON DVD. I WAS ESPECIALLY PREPARED TO BE DISAPPOINTED BY THE FACT IT HAD NEVER BEEN CLOSE TO ATTAINING STARDOM AS MOONRAKER, STAR WARS OR EVEN THE BLACK HOLE HAD, WHICH SEEMED TO SAY IT WAS BOUND TO BE LOUSY. WELL, WHADDAYAKNOW, IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD; THE PLOT WAS INTERESTING, THE SOMETIMES OBVIOUS SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE FAR FROM RIDICULOUS GIVEN THE MOVIE'S AGE, AND I FOUND MYSELF CONSTANTLY SURPRISED AT MY OWN GROWING INTEREST IN THE MOVIE. SOME SO-CALLED FUTURISTIC MOVIES ARE SO STUPID YOU HATE THE PRODUCERS FOR HAVING TAKEN YOU FOR A BOZO BY MARKETING SUCH CRAP, AND MANAGING TO CON YOU OUT OF THE THEATER TICKET YOU SPENT PRECIOUS MONEY ON (INDEPENDANCE DAY, F'R INSTANCE); IN THIS CASE, I THOUGHT IT WAS SAD I'D NEVER COME AROUND TO VIEWING THIS MOVIE BEFORE. OBVIOUSLY, IF YOU'RE UNDER 20, YOU'LL PROBABLY NOT CATCH ON UNLESS YOU'RE INTO WEIRD OR DESUET MOVIES, NOT HI-TECH SPACERS. PEOPLE OVER THAT AGE, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO WERE YOUNG IN THE '70s WILL FIND IT A NOSTALGIA BOOSTER. I PLACE IT AMONG THE IMPORTANT MOVIES OF THE '70s; THOSE I'LL WANT TO MAKE SURE MY KIDS SEE...
