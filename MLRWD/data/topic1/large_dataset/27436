IMHO, I acknowledge only two Indiana Jones movies worthy of greatness: the Original Raiders movie and this, the Temple of Doom. The other two Indy films: Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull are poorly paced, contrived, tired, simplistic and very derivative. I know many people disagree with this assessment, but hold Temple of Doom against the other two movies, and you will see the weaknesses: thin plotlines, poor action sequences, tired pacing and inferior storytelling. The last two movies that simply don't measure up to the first two.

TOD is definitely the darkest of the Indy films; watching the adventure unfold, you are literally lowered into the pits of hell, in the face of true evil and darkness, with one of the strongest villains in film history. This very movie created the PG-13 rating category, which says alot about the level of horror portrayed. Like Raiders, TOD is a fast paced adventure rocket ride that features superb photography, exotic locations, a wonderful new original musical score by John Williams and rip roaring action sequences that stand as textbook examples on how to expertly film an action movie. The various action sequences have a natural flow to them that are physically credible, well sequenced and exciting.  Short Round and Willie Scott are Indy's companions in this sequel, and both add sporadic necessary humor and lightheartedness to break up and balance off the extremely dark and nightmarish sequences. Despite Spielberg's personal opinion about TOD not being his favorite Indy movie, I consider this film one of Spielberg's greatest film achievements. From beginning to the end, you are on the edge of your seat. This is pure adventure in the spirit of the old movie serials.
