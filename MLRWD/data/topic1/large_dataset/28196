I must have come across this film shortly after it was released, and I have watched it a few more times over the years - most recently, yesterday. I find it as entertaining as ever, but by now it has also acquired a retro quality, which imparts a peculiar touch of chic. I think that this is largely due to the lead actors being still fairly young there, but also the overall style of acting, which happens to be both old-school and over-the-top at the same time - they do not do it that way any longer. The combination of mechanical special effects (some of them quite impressive, some crude) with early CGI work also adds to the retro feel: in that respect the film marks the watershed between two technological eras, almost as if this were done intentionally.

I do not share the view that the plot is too schematic nor that it lacks originality. If anything, I find it rather advanced for a film that aspires only to entertain. One nontrivial aspect, which is often commented on, is that the storyline contains several indications that the whole Martian adventure could be a dream after all. Another, which I have not seen mentioned by anybody, is that the orthodox scheme of good triumphing over evil is strengthened in a most inventive way: the good is fictitious (Quaid never existed as a person; he is an implanted false memory), and yet it prevails over the real evil. Fancy that!
