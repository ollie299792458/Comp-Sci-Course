I watched this movie last night.I found it be very interesting, nothing out of this world, but I was impressed by some of the social statements made, like danny Glover when he talks to his nephew about being good out on the street, and he tells him "what are you going to come up with some great idea to clean up the streets that no one else has thought of". The  central thought of this movie is that the world is chaos, that really we don't have any control, even though we'd like to think we do.I felt this movie was alright and could be used to teach us about the world we live in. I'm surprised to read the reviews of people who disliked this movie. It's sad because every year Hollywood puts out stupid cinderella romance movies, that within the first five minutes of watching the movie I already know how it's going to end and I gain nothing from it, but when Hollywood puts out a movie with social commentary on the world we just bash it. People want perfection in a world that isn't perfect, this movie isn't great by any means but at least this time hollywood tried to make a movie that made us think about the world around us, as opposed to another boring tearjerker about the guy who always gets the girl.
