For fans of the original Doctor Who, rest assured - this is still the Doctor we know and love. Here are but a few things you will recognize:

1. The Doctor can't seem to control the TARDIS.

2. The Doctor takes offense at the suggestion that he can't control the TARDIS.

3. The people from UNIT are useless.

4. An enemy uses the Doctor's emotions against him.

5. The Doctor thinks a companion is dead, and it's his fault.

6. A companion thinks the Doctor is dead, and it's her fault.

7. The Doctor is strapped to a table and tortured.

8. Something pulls the TARDIS off course - not that it was going where it was supposed to, anyway.

9. The Doctor makes vague passing references to famous events of the past, as if he's been there.

10. The Doctor refuses to use violence.

11. The Doctor becomes violent.

12. The Doctor seems amused by things that aren't particularly amusing.

13. The Doctor boasts of being able to go anywhere in space and time, but somehow always ends up on or around the earth.

14. The Doctor is always the only person who can come up with a solution to save the day.

15. The Doctor never changes clothes, never showers, and never needs a shave.

16. The sonic screwdriver.

17. Autons.

Of course, there are some things that will appear new and baffling to fans of the original series. For example:

1. The TARDIS lands on earth, but not in England. (Well, okay, this did happen once or twice in the original, but only the staunchest fans will remember it.)

2. A Dalek that's actually scary. For a few moments, it's terrifying.

3. Innuendo. Boy, was that a no-no way back when.

4. A companion who actually has a home to go to.

5. CGI.

6. Slitheen. (Personally, I could pass. Give me big lumbering Ice Warriors or fuzzy Yeti any day. Or better yet, giant bugs made of bubble wrap.)

So who's the real Who?

Only you can decide.

For my money, I love them both!
