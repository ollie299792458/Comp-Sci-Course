Well, if you have never read the books, like myself, you will probably really enjoy this. It's always hard to watch a sequel to a great classic, but this was really so well done, and the music was so good,
it is a classic as well as the first one, but in it's own right. It's fun to watch the kids growing up in this. I can't compare it to the first one for many reasons but, as Aslan the lion says, "Things never happen the same way twice." And so it is a new story with the addition of some delightful new characters and some sad overtones of a Narnia that once was, and was lost until the long-awaited return of the "Kings and Queens of old" (the children) who had grown into adults there, and reverted back to children upon exiting Narnia through the wardrobe portal. This proves to be an emotional and difficult transition for all of them, especially Peter, as a year of their real life translates to a thousand of Narnia years. So all they knew in the first visit to Narnia are lost, except for Aslan of course, and he makes three appearances. I do suggest you watch 'The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe' first, to get an idea of what is happening in this one. Aside from my favorite, Lucy, I especially love Repicheep the brave and humorous mouse who steals the scenes over and again with remarks about his mousy size. Every one of the 'human' actors are superb. This is definitely a keeper!
