Buying exercise DVDs is always a bit of a gamble for me, so this review will attempt to give a good peek inside before you buy.
If you are looking to tone your legs and abs in a graceful manner, this is a good choice. It will make your legs work and you will definitely break a sweat, especially while doing the jumps.  Likewise, if you are looking to supplement your ballet 1 class, this features pseudo bar work: staples like plies, releves, rond de jambes, and changement jumps. No major floor work or combinations, and no real position correction for port-de-bras or posture, but then again it is a conditioning, not a "dance the ballet," video, so that's not a real issue.
You will likely recognize a few stretches if you take yoga, and the moves from the abs floor work if you take pilates. The upright portion is about 35 minutes and the floorwork about 10. Other pros include beautiful scenery which is pleasant to look at while exercising, and that you really only need about a 6ft radius of space to do this workout. I found the instructor's affirmations to be a little cloyingly cheerful, but perhaps some need the constant motivation (and I suppose saying that a burning quad is just releasing energy can't hurt.)
Overall, a great bargain that I am glad I purchased.
