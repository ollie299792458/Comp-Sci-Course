A lot of folk make a big deal out of the fact that "legally blonde" Reese makes her film debut with this movie.  Most of us, however, watch movies for the storytelling.  (We all have wasted hours of our lives watching absolute dogs because some overpaid windbag was in it.)  But this is a great story and you won't care who the "stars" are.  If we never heard from any of these actors again this would still be a great movie.
The plotline is very simple and in many ways predictable.  But the real art is how the story is told from beginning to end.  You end up caring about all the characters and how your sympathy moves from one to another.
Buy this DVD and buy some additional copies to give to your friends.  I have found myself thinking about this movie years after I first watched it.  Its that good.
(OK.  I'm glad little Reese W. went on to become a big star making other films.  But I watched those films and forgot them the next day.  It would be ironic if at the end of her career her best film was made before anyone cared about who she was.)
