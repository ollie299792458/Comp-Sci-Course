"Is It Just Me?" was a Netflix recommendation based on other movies I've watched.  I read the summary and thought it sounded cute.  As a straight woman, I love romantic comedies - gay, straight, lesbian, whatever!  It arrived in the mail today, so I popped it in and spent the next 90 min. admiring the eye candy that was Cameron (Adam Huss), the sweetness that was Blaine (Nicholas Downs) and the near perfection of Xander (David Loren).  I would love to find a straight Xander of my own...yowza!  The movie's premise has been done, a million times over!  But it was still sweet.  The chemistry between Blaine and Xander was wonderful and romantic.  I actually cared about what happened to them.  Cameron provided some great comic relief.  I thought they could have done more with the backstory on why Blaine was so self-pitying and scared.  Was it just because of his parents rejection?  And more backstory on Xander would have made me invest myself more in the movie.

Overall, I would say this movie was relatively good.  Was it great?  Nah...but if you like RomComs, give this one a shot.  I'm actually considering purchasing it from Amazon.com.

Does anyone have other recommendations for good RomComs?
