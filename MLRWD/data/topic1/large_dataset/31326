So here we have at last a live dvd perfomance of Aerosmith.Don't be tricked fellows.When i bought this dvd,i had that bad feeling of it and that was because these people are getting realy old.I can't say the concert sucks,but it lacks the energy Aero-guys used to have and this is of course because of their age(Somehow J.Perry reminded me on stage of Keith Richards!:).Anyway,i've read all of the reviews here and watched this dvd several times,so here are the things i've mentioned:

1. An average live perfomance,not acousticaly,but visualy.As i said,these guys are not teens anymore.Steven continue to save the  visual image of the band.

2. Paid models dancing and kissing?!!!Come on ppl,i've saw gals kissing even at Scorpions concert!I'm pretty sure that if you watch the entire thing,you'll soon notice that the main purpose of this release is to catch and show a point of energy and entertainment.Pointing the gals and happy crowd and not the band,shows that the band isn't as energetic as they used to be,thats why all the cameras were looking for cheering people,to fullfill that gap.Some people liked this,some didn't and some even said it was a whole fake thing.In my opinion it was 100% true.Bands like Aerosmith don't need to pay girls to sing their songs or dance in their concerts.

3. The thousands of cuts included may get you tired a bit,but it's a matter of taste as well.

4. The interviews covering the intros of most of the songs,realy suck.This is not a spoiler though,but it gets realy annoying.

I think most of the fans will enjoy this release.It could be pretty better,but it is a way better than i personaly expected.
