GO! Laugh!Enjoy! And by the way, "Maxine 2", I AM 69-- FEMALE--- and used to ride (not Hogs though)and STILL will hop on a bike when the opportunity presents itself. Hey, I saw Easy Rider when it first opened. A CLASSIC that will NOT leave you laughing. You will want to go out and hurt every bigot you can find!

I went to see Wild Hogs and burst out laughing in the opening credits. Never stopped laughing. Travolta showed a little of his old Vinne Barbario character, for those of you who remember Welcome Back Kotter.( I loved Vinnie)

SO---could all the pretentious critics out there STOP with the remarks about thin plot, mediocre acting, no charater development, inane slapstick, etc. If you MUST cling to your psuedo-intellectual superiority, aka wanna-be-upper-class bigotry, then go read The Brothers Karamazov.

There is enough angst, blood, guts, fear, and horror out there in the world and the media everyday. What is wrong with escaping into a visually pretty movie, well shot---- very near my sister's home in NM so I know those roads----that made me FEEL the wind in my hair, the scents of the countryside, and the freedom of being on a bike again.

This movie will make you laugh whether you want to or not. UP those endorphins and go get high on WILD HOGS. You will still be laughing when you are getting in your car after seeing the movie.

If you can't find this a hilarious romp then you need to get over yourself.

BIG SCREEN is best to get the real "Feeling" of riding. If you never have ridden you will want to when you leave the theater. One of life's  simple joys!

Yup, am getting the DVD too--to use when I have a bad day and need a real lift. It's THAT funny and entertaining.

So go LAUGH and never mind the critics reviews.
