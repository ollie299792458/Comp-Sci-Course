I am a huge fan of all types of animation. It's wonderful that stop motion is getting some new life with the likes of Nightmare Before Christmas, Coraline, Corpse Bride and now this gem Fantastic Mr. Fox. I was not familiar with the Dahl book or story so I was going into this one blind. I fell in love with the characters, story, sets, voices and animation immediately. The majority of the movie's humor and dialogue (there's a good deal of desert dry chatter in this film) will fly right over the heads of most children and even some adults to be certain. The humor is dry, full of wit and adult driven. I loved it!

Video quality on this Blu Ray is strong, nearly perfect. Autumn colors are abundant and the texture of the character's wardrobe and fur is nothing short of amazing. These details really bring this film to life. The audio quality is good; the center channel gets the biggest work out by far on this DTS HD MA lossless track. I was a tad disappointed that the surround speakers and sub-woofer did not get more activity. This audio track was a bit subdued for such a lively movie. Make no mistake though, the dialogue is handled extremely well and the track sounds very solid. Just just don't expect a wiz bang audio excursion track like Up, Wall-E or Coraline.

The vocal casting and acting in this animated feature are superb; I don't think I have ever heard better in any animated film. You can sell this one to the kids but the adults are the ones that will truly reap the reward when this disc starts up. This is a must own title for all animation and home video enthusiasts. Don't waste another minute Cussing around, pick this up immediately!
