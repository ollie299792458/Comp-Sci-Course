I normally like Vin Diesel and I'm a big fan of sci-fi but this one just didn't work for me.  The story line &lt;no spoilers> is set sometime in the future against a series of backdrops that mix high tech and grunge.  Something like Blade Runner, just not as well done.  A mercenary, named Toorop (Diesel) is supposed to transport two females from some kind of convent in Russia to New York City.  The younger of the two females is the package, the older one is her handler.  As the journey unfolds you discover that the younger woman possesses some kind of mysterious traits (no spoilers).

The problem with the movie is that you spend so long in those dark, depressing scenes that it really takes a toll on the pace; worse yet, you never really get an engaging story line.  It's plotted more like a video game.  The group gets attacked, Toorop fights.  The group gets attacked, Toorop fights.  And though the human interest part could have made the movie tolerable, it too falls victim to all the dreary grunge scenes.  In the end you feel like you spent two hours watching a gun fight in a junk yard.  Just not my cup of tea.
