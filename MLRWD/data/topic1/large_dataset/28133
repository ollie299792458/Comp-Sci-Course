Without giving away the story, it is just not credible visually. People outside in full fur but no hats, attempting to leave a lady alone with limited supplies, maybe I missed it, but where did the baby go? And where did the boat come from? The one with the motor that mom didn't know how to operate? And does Hollywoood think people from south east Asia really look like First Peoples from the north?  Ever seen a 40 year old woman from north of the Arctic Circle? Very few look like they have personal trainers and gym memberships.

Interesting the story line is fine. I hadn't read the reviews before watching, but it seemed more credible, in a folk tale sort of way, than not. I bought it. Disturbing as several have said, but hey, so is life sometimes.

Forgetting things that would make you die in the north (no hats, etc), the imagery is breathtaking. Svalbard looking very inviting. Many times I was tempted to leave because of the poor details, but eventually gave up on them and just sat back and enjoyed the scenery. You'll do the same.

Five visually, one for pc and details. Watch it, just realize its more Hollywood than docudrama.
