I got this collection for my grandkids.  They loved it even though it didn't have all the special effects they are so used to in adventure films today. (i.e.: in the early movies you could tell Tarzan was swinging from a trapeze, the gorillas were obviously men dressed as apes) And my husband and I really enjoyed watching them with the kids.

The first original Tarzan movie of 1932 was a little more violent than the later movies.  The treatment of animals seemed harsher and Tarzan seemed a little cold blooded himself.  In later movies Jane had civilized him to some degree and he seemed more compassionate and less primitive with each movie.

The later movies were less violent and centered on Tarzan and Jane's family life in the jungle and how superior it was to the corporate jungle. Footage from one movie was often carried to the next, but it was fun to see it again.  There were some really cute and funny animal scenes involving Cheetah and the baby elephant and other baby animals which our youngest grand daughter thoroughly enjoyed.

There is a little violence in the movies that very young children should not see, but nothing very graphic.  i.e. Tarzan has to kill a charging Rhino and rides his back and stabs him.  Some of the scenes with natives involve killing.

The scenes between Tarzan, Jane and later, Boy, are very loving and tender and touched with humor.  We loved watching them and we will continue to watch them over and over I'm sure.
