No doubt hidden in the 271 reviews that precedes my own you will find many of my ideas and thoughts about this movie.  No matter, I still feel obligated to share what this movie meant and continues to mean to me.  To begin, credit must be given to the composer and artist of  this film.  While, although sometimes a bit cheesy (ie. that same choo-choo-train sewer music playing whenever unicron appeares, which is borrowed from from ROCKY IV), the music does energize the film at times and makes for a great soundrack. Next, despite what some others have said, the animation for this film was great for its time.  I mean, who could ever forget that scene when Optimus decides, "Megatron must be stopped--no matter what the cost," and leaps into action blasting away.  That's the stuff great memories are made of.  Conversely, however,  the plot of this movie made perfect sense when I was ten years old, but now seems a bit weak.  But what can you expect? After all, it IS--or WAS--a childrens cartoon.  More than anything I think this film represents the end of an era.  While kids still have vivid imaginations and continue to love cartoons, I wonder if they will obsess over them (running home from school to make sure you didn't miss a minute) like we did.  In these days of powerfull computers, DVDs, and Wallmart(hehe), I don't know if things will ever be the same.  Bottom line, I love this movie not only for what it is( a childrens cartoon), but for what we made it( a legend that defines a generation).  Autobots, transform and roll out.
