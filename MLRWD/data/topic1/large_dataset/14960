Having just watched this DVD, I got the impression that what was a very impressive cast have been bogged down with what is a below average script.  The idea itself is pretty good, but having not read the actual book, I am unable to comment on my belief that the book is far better than the movie. Can anyone prove me right?? However, the movie drags on around the idea of the child, and the idea fails to create the feel good factor the movie wants it to. I believe any half decent cast could have played the roles of the characters in this movie, and Spacey, Hunt, and Osment were going through the motions unable to spark a utter bore!  The movie constantly fails to make the audience feel sympathy for the characters, and not even a last ditch attempt of an  ending can evoke the kind of sympathy towards the main characters as everybody involved in the movie would have liked.  While I am not dissuading anybody from buying the DVD, as I know opinion differs, I am just warning you not to end the movie feeling you have watched one of the all time classics!!
