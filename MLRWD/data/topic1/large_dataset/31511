I do not know whether Columbia TriStar will distribute this title in the States when the time comes, but they distributed the Hong Kong version of this, 2000s most original, beautiful, exciting and breathtaking movie.  The features found on the Hong Kong disc are plentiful and also very well produced. There is a 15 minute interview with lead actres Michelle Yeoh, an extensive gallery of pictures from the making of the movie, a very informative and fun commentary by director Ang Lee and producer/scribe James Schamus.  The menus are animated but it takes slightly too long for them to finish, which can be annoying. Beside the usual trailer, the DVD also features the music video for "A Love Before Time" by Coco Lee, both in Mandarin and in English. There is an English voice track for the movie, which is not recommended, listen to the original instead and use subtitles.  So please, here my plea: Keep these features on the American disc, and add some things that are missing, like a making-of featurette and more extensive talent files. 
All in all, a great disc and a great movie. Best of luck to Ang Lee et al at the Oscars.
