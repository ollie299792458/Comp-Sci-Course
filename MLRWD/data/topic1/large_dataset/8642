Patton, released in 1970, is said to be one of the greatest war films of all times even some 34 years later.  George C. Scott is so convincing as Patton that you forget he is acting.  At nearly 3 hours, it won seven Academy Awards.  Patton, a crazy yet brave General of World War II is a man who's entire being evolves around war and his ego.  Director Franklin J. Schaffner ensures that the audience sees General Patton not only as the fiery tyrant who believes he is the reincarnation of Alexander The Great, but also how soft-skinned he is.  In the end, the audience has a genuine love-hate relationship with this General who while is respected above all others by the Germans would waste a soldier's life to feed his own ego.  This film, full of death, destruction, and action is just what any man could have ordered in a film.  While others are notable in the film including, Karl Malden as Gen. Omar N. Bradley, Scott completely overshadows everyone else.  I rate this color, VHS film, from Fox Home Entertainment, as 4 stars and agree that it deserves the awards it has won.
