I'll save the summary for everyone else who's already done it.  This is a documentary that could have kept going, and I wouldn't have cared.  I felt like crying a few times. I felt anger.

And rarest of all, I felt interest for a time period that is neither my primary field, nor country.  I'm a pre-19th century European historian, not 20th century American.  That's a first.

I'm also not a war fan, don't like war movies, am not good with dates and battles and strategies... but this documentary pulled me in.

Don't expect the reading of a standard history book, nor a glowing report of our leaders through the World Wars and Vietnam, because you won't get one.

Don't expect to see footage of protestors with their flower power or sappy, lingering tributes to fallen soldiers and leaders (such as JFK).

Do expect to see eleven lessons flashed up on the screen throughout the documentary, and be prepared to be startled over one of them, at least.

Do expect to see a former Secretary of State, in a thoroughly lucid and entertaining state at age 85, talking about events some of us grew up with, or had parents who wouldn't talk about because they were desperately trying to forget.

As much as I enjoy Michael Moore, skip him over and get this first.  It may not be about our current events, but these events created the nation we live in today.  That's vital.
