I would have given this one star, but Allison McAtee's performance kicked it up one star. She gave a believable performance as the flawed college professor who violated ethical boundaries by sleeping with her students. Of course, if *I* had a college professor who looked like her, I would NEVER miss a class!

Whoever cast Sarah Stouffer as a twenty-something college student needs to have their eyes checked. SHE should have been cast in "Loving Annabelle" as the high school student, because she did NOT look old enough for this role and it gave the entire storyline an incestuous twist. My friends, who watched this with me, kept murmuring "mommy issues" during every single scene between Catherine (the professor) and Jackie (the student).

As another reviewer stated, there are NO lesbian sex scenes between Catherine and Jackie (it fades to black each time), which is actually a good thing, considering the "mommy issues" twist. Even though this was made by a lesbian, the two characters are NOT lesbians. There is implied heterosexual sex between Catherine and her male "date," but I felt this was Catherine's way of getting back at Jackie. At a party, a male classmate of Jackie's kisses her, which was TOTALLY out of left field, and the next scene is Jackie getting dressed after having sex with the guy.

Overall, if it were not for Allison McAtee, I would say I wasted my money on this DVD. I would NEVER recommend this to my lesbian friends, because I know they would be appalled by the "mommy issues" twist. If the lesbian sex scenes went a bit further, I WOULD recommend it to most of my straight male friends, because I KNOW they would get off on it.

Unless you are a fan of Allison McAtee or have money to burn, do not waste it on this.
