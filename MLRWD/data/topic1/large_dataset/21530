With a screenplay written by a true War Hero and public servant, Sen Jim Webb, former SecNav, Navy Cross awardee, award winning author, its premise and action describe all too well the challenges of serving in the military of a democracy.  Although the story is fictional, it is all too close to the reality servicemen have experienced since Korea.  A society and its politicians who are more focused on not losing rather than at winning at war, an ignorant nation that is too quick to blame its military caught in the vice of knowing how to win in the most terrible of human endeavors -- war -- and trying to please the too many in society that have refused to and will never take up such a burden.  Childers playing a MEU (SOC) commander [look it up] is representative of a Marine commander who has been out there, on patrol in defense of this nation for decades.  The rescue of the Mayaguez, Grenada, Beirut, Liberia, Bosnia, Kosovo, the War on Terror,  -- are all examples of the quick slope down which a peacetime commander will have to slide when an unexpected threat to American interests arises.  Childers responds as anyone might in his position.  Focus on the mission, minimize casualties AMONG YOUR OWN and get out quickly.  Unfortunately he then must face the Monday morning, arm chair quarterbacking that too often follows after the danger passes and those who do not suffer the burden of command have the luxury of commenting on and judging it -- his actions.  This is a must see for those who truly want to "support the troops" by at least trying to gain some understanding of the ironies of their command situation and the true love these real heroes have for their nation.
