Comedies of any sort generally have a short half-life with me. Once you've  seen the gags, they don't usually bear repeated viewings. So, when I find  one of those rare comedies that's still watchable and enjoyable after the  third or fourth time I see it, I know it's a keeper.
And Grosse Pointe  Blank is definitely a keeper. Black comedy with some verve is very, very  hard to do well, but here the hard thing to do is find a flaw. The  characters are interesting and don't act in predictable ways. The casting  is right on (I even liked Minnie Driver in this and I usually don't much  care for her). Everyone plays their role with just the right level of  intensity - it would have been very easy to overdo this (Dan Ackroyd,  especially, could have gone totally overboard but instead he plays a very  disturbed person just so, and we end up believing him; in less talented  hands, that character would have been a mess). In fact, if anything the  cast errs on the side of downplaying the oddness they're all swimming in (a  must for a good black comedy).
I rarely buy new tapes. I just know I  won't want to watch them enough to justify the expense. Not so Grosse  Pointe Blank. Don't dither, buy. This movie is great!
