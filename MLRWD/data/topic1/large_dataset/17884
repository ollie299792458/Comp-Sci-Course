An unbalanced man, having witnessed his parent's murder by a "Santa," goes beserk when his toy store boss makes him don a Santa suit. 
This is the only SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT film that is worth watching if you had to decide between the first three films. I'm really not too sure about the last two, but I heard they were horrible and had nothing to do with the originals. Anyway, this is a pretty original horror film, but I still don't understand why it was never allowed to be shown in theatres. When I saw it, it wasn't anymore violent than EVIL DEAD 2-DEAD BY DAWN (which was shown in theatres). I guess it had something to do with too many violent scenes and the fact that it took place during Christmas. 
I'm going to be honest about this film. It didn't really scare me a whole lot, but it was kind of creepy. You have to admit, some of the violent scenes were hilarious, and the scene with the bullies was very original. That's what makes this a good film. There are lots of twists and surprises too. It's hard to know which Santa Claus is the killer when you see many of them walking around on the streets. 
I've only seen the first three films of SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT, and this was the only one worth watching (which I've said before). Part 2 is more of a review for the first one than it is a sequel. And the third entry was just boring. Try this one. You might like it.
I hope my review was helpful to you!
