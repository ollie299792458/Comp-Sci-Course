I've seldom had the privilege to see such an incredible film based on one of the most truthful and eloquent novels ever written. This was the exception.

First, I must say I believe in Objectivism and, while I don't agree with everything Ayn Rand ever said and certainly not everything she ever did, I do agree with her basic philosophy.

She would have been proud of this film, in my opinion. It's visually beautiful, the actors are incredible and it touches your soul if you believe in Capitalism and individualism.

The music score is beautiful. The entire production is first class.

Having said that, a friend watched it and said, "I didn't like it." She simply couldn't grasp it or comprehend it. She hadn't read the book and was not familiar with the Rand philosophy. So, it's possible that only those of us who do understand and appreciate Rand will like this extraordinary movie.

There are those who simply don't understand and can't appreciate anything outside of their current knowledge. Those people likely won't enjoy this film.

Highly recommended.
