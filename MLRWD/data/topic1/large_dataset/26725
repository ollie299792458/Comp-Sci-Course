 I've been waiting for the Ultimate Flint Collection for some time now. Both these offerings are a gem. James Coburn is super slick, super cool, and is the best send up of 007 ever put on film. As a matter of fact a spokesman for the Bond films once said when asked about Bond's competition, "James Bond is a parody. How can you parody a parody?" Derek Flint does just that, and to coin a phrase; Nobody did it better!
 Growing up, Flint gave me two things that I will always be grateful for, one, a love & appreciation for Bouillabaisse and a philosophy regarding women. When asked what attributed to his success with women he said, "Simple, I don't compete with them!"
 Being a parody the films are absurd in a fun sort of way. They have a great pace that lends well to the globe trotting. The fight scenes are awesome because some may not know this, Coburn was a Martial Arts pupil of Bruce Lee. Of the two films I've always felt the first one was the better but lets face it, two Flints are better than one.
 If you're a fan of the 'spy genre' and you've never seen these films, you owe it to yourself to check them out, and if you remember them fondly, your collection is incomplete without them. Thank you so much Amazon for making these DVD's available.
