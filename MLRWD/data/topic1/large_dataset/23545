I absolutely love Gwyneth Paltrow and John Hannah in this charming romantic comedy. It's definitely offbeat, and explores the idea of paralell universes. Ever wondered what your life would be like if you made just one choice differently? Branching off from one single event (a parent pulling a little girl out of a woman's way on the subway), Helen's life is drastically changed. In one scenario, she stays with her two-timing boyfriend (who is an absolute jerk, but manages to come off as slightly charming), and in the other, she meets a new man named James (John Hannah, in my favorite male hero character ever!). The movie is funny and cute, and manages also to be terribly interesting - the viewer watches the two universes travel farther and farther apart, wondering how the director will bring the two universes back together. He successfuly does so, in a surprising and bittersweet finale that leaves the viewer uncertain whether to cry or cheer.  This is one of those great, rare movies that manages to be deep as well as entertaining, and I give it my highest reccommendations.  Well done!
