For the most part, DAHMER is a failure ... The film, especially the direction, wasn't good enough as a character study alone, there is no visual feel ( it looks made-for-TV ) and nothing in the film made me feel any sympathy for the lead ... I mention this first because I think that's what the makers were going for, because there is really no gore, no cannibalism, nothing particularly scary or disturbing ... and let's face it, when you make a film about one of the most notoriously horrific people in criminal history, it should convey some of that feeling ...... The one thing I thought was done well was the transformation of Jeffery in the flashbacks: he was convincing as a teenager ... ... Overall, the film comes across to me as an attempt to show Dahmer in a different light, but it fails in it's own pretense ... It seems as if a group of politically correct amateurs got together and tried to make a thought-provoking film, and in doing so, skirted over the meat ( sorry, couldn't resist ) of the actual story ... If they wanted to make a film about a troubled and emotionally tormentented man, fine, but it's not interesting on that level ... and if they wanted to make a successful film about a cannibalistic necrophiliac, well, they failed with that big time ... DAHMER is far less interesting than the actual account of Jeffery Dahmer's life ...
