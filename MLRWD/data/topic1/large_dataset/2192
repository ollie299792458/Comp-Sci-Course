In the town of Glie, there's an abandoned dorm called Old Home where several creatures with grey wings and glowing halos live. They're neither human nor angel. No one knows how they came to be living there in the first place and no one seems to really care either. The story begins with the birth of a new haibane from a cocoon. She dreamed that she was falling so her name came to be Rakka (which means "fall"). This is the story of the haibane of Old Home and how the live and work in Glie.
This is one of the most awesome anime ever. It's not spectacularly amazing, but it feels that way. It more than makes up for ABe's lain, which is really pale in comparison to this. It is similar to ABe's works in that it features a young girl trying to find where she belongs in life. It's what NieA_7 would have been if it were serious and had a plot.
I would strongly reccomend this anime if you like dramatic anime or if you liked some of ABe's previous works. If you think ABe is just all about lain and you thought it wasn't good at all, give Haibane Renmei a try and you'll be glad you did.
