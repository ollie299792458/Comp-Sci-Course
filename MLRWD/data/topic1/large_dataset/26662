It has been quite a while since I have seen this one and I do have the other two Harryhausen Sinbad films. This one is a bit longer and the pace is slower than the other ones but the acting and storyline is much improved. The actors look more authentic no blond haired blue eyed Sinbad here. What sets this one apart is the humor too and that there is a number of separate story arcs that come together with the main one. A shopkeeper in town pays Sinbad to take his lazy son to sea with him and make him a man. that addition is great where while the main story goes on the son serves as a bit of comic relief and he eventually becomes a useful member of the crew.
  It has the necessary elements and evil wizard with an over the top performance. His story is a bit more important here too as he ages from the use of his powerful magics. The concern of his henchmen over his aging and health. A beautiful girl but this time she is not a princess but a slave freed by Sinbad. The stop motion mastery of Ray Harryhausen is also here the fight with Kali is impressive with all her limbs.
  I am a big fan of Harryhausens work and have seen most of his films. They have more of a handcrafted look than today's films. This is why I like them so much and like to look at special effects extravaganza,s pre computer days. Ironic because I have spent quite a bit of time doing such work on the computer but still prefer the old school effects.
