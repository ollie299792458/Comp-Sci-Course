I know that this wasn't Norton's first work but this was my first E.N. film,and i have been tracked him ever since.Of course,Edward Norton is not the only thing that appeals to you in this movie:Edward Furlong is fine too;but the story is great,rough and makes you think while you make your way home in silence.A story about hate,partnership,death,regret and redemption.
But Edward Norton is the light that guides everything here,with a powerful acting (as usual),helped by those continuous flashbacks that help you understand the reasons why ,and changing wonderfully from full-colour to black and white and vice versa all the time.This is why you see the characters with a different look depending on the time the story is talking about.
After this one i have seen every film Norton has shown up in but Frida,and he is great.He deserves those 2 oscar- nominations and even more.He can play everything.
So if you want to enjoy a very good "old school" movie with great acting and a delicate subject get this one.You will not regret it.
Thank you all.
