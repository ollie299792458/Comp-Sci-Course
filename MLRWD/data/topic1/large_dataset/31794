First of all, if you have not read the book and are strictly watching this DVD because you believe it will be like Kubrick's edition, don't waste your time!  However, if you have read the book or are open-minded about this edition, definitely watch it!
This edition is almost word for word out of the book.  If you are a big fan of the book, you'll love this movie.  I love this edition because it is so much like the book, which is my favorite SK book.
Don't get me wrong, Kubrick's The Shining is the scariest movie I've ever seen, but after I read the book the movie was so off in left field compared to the book I couldn't stand it.
The acting is a little iffy but overall the movie is very good.  For those of you that say that this edition is stupid, it is likely you haven't read the book, if you'd had, you'd know the story isn't an already crazy father decides to kill his family.  Rather, an ex-alcoholic is possessed by a hotel to obtain his son's special power.
This is an excellent companion to the book!  I highly recommend it!
