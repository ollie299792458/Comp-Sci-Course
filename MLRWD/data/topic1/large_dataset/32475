Alright, this film is a classic. Some of my best childhood memories involved me watching this with my dad, it sparked a life-long interest in space and me to become a science major. Whenever I go to the air and space museum, I can't help buy smile like a little kid when I see Gene Kranz's vest in a display case. The special effects have aged well. The educational and entertainment value of this movie are marvelous and I will probably end up buying another release in a few years to show my kids should I ever have them.

Now the blu-ray release:
All I cared about was picture quality, and in that sense, the release delivers flawlessly. It is not a lousy blu-ray port unlike some I've had to deal with. I had not bothered upgrading from the VHS release because the picture was so crisp for a tape (and was better than some early DVD releases). I held out for a release that had something that made it worth the double dip.

Problems with the BD release:
Ok, so in order to make the blu-ray look "fancy", universal has added a bunch of silly junk. You can't really pause the film: it only stays paused for about a minute and then turns to a Universal logo screen saver. You can return to the film eventually.
There is also a bunch of superfluous functionality that I haven't bothered messing with because I don't care. I just want the movie in higher quality and that's what I got, so I'm ok.
The trailers are a non-issue if your player is not connected to the internet.
