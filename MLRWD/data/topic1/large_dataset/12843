Having grown up with Greek friends in high school and the Greek friend of my family that we now have, I can appreciate the humor of this movie, because believe me some of it is really true!!!

Just like in the movie, no matter how much I may not feel like eating, I better not eat much that day, if I know I'm going to visit my greek friend!!! Like Toula infers in the movie, your going to get food one way or another. To greeks as in the movie, family is very important. And sometimes, bless my friend Maria's heart but decorations can be somewhat gawdy-case in point-in the movie-Aphrodite Palace, the reception hall or check out the exterior of the Portokalos house!!!

The spitting on the bride is a real wedding tradition and that Ouzo that they drink is like Black Licorice Fire going down your throat when you first drink it-note Ian's parents when they first drink it!!

Plenty of typical Greek stereotypes but if you have some greek friends and understand the culture, you'll laugh and be glad you have them as friends!!!
