Steven Soderbergh's follow up to his wonderful 1998 film "Out of Sight" is more understated and subtle than most people might imagine. The Limey is in many respects the closest Hollywood has come in years to  filming a modern film noir picture.
The main plot of the Limey is of  little to no importance. Terence Stamp plays a bitter old Englishmen who  comes to LA to seek revenge for his murdered daughter. His pursuit of  vengeance eventually leads him to a sleazy record producer, brilliantly  played by Peter Fonda.
The Limey is a film that revolves around its use  of atmosphere. Soderbergh, forever a film geek, uses cuts in time and  flashbacks (a constant one to Stamp on a plane) to establish a dark gritty  atmosphere which he manages to sustain throughout the whole film.  The  scripting is a perfect fabrication of a film noir, every character is  menacingly constructed to be a worn out tough guy. 
If anything negative  can be said about the film is that it seems to go on a little long. In  actuality the film is perfect length but the many scenes without dialogue  make it seem longer than it is. Time and time again does Soderbergh cut to  shots of Stamp staring into thin air reflecting. It establishes atmosphere  wonderfully but if you are looking for a wild ride of an action movie the  Limey is not your cup of tea.
The Limey is a movie that would be adored  by serious film fans but despised by the kind of people who go to the  theatre just to watch a fun popcorn movie.If you got this far and you're  reading this review then you probably love films.
