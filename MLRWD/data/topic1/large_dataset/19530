Well, I would have to say that I've been a TZ fan since I was like 14 I believe.  I wasn't born yet when they first came out.  So, what I was watching were the reruns that would air late at night.  This collection captures that time in my life.  It includes some great extras:  Rod Serling speaking at a seminar.  Some clips from a game show he hosted and lot's of commentary from actors who starred in some of the episodes.  They also include some of the press junkets for TV shows of the day. And, public service announcements that they would NEVER show today!  I'm only at season 3 at the moment but so far it has been GREAT!  I paid about $160 from Amazon.  Which is quite less when it first came out.  I also have the Columbia House Video collection.  That was very expensive like $20 a cassette with only 4 episodes on each cassete.  You do the math.  Yikes!  Some of the tapes are not working properly.  I was so happy to see this DVD collection available.  All shown in order as they were aired.  I highly recommend this collection to any TZ fan and any science fiction fan!  Rod Serling was an incredible writer!
