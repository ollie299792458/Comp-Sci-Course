This is by far the stupidest movie ever!  I just rented that "poopie" of a film yesterday night and I thought it was an insult to the original.  Besides the actors not being half as attractive (or tanned) as that of the Ryan Phillipe, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Reese Witherspoon, their acting was horrible.  More than half the time this movie was trying to be exactly like the first.  Exact quotes were derived for their booger of a twisted plot.  At times I thought this was the porn version of the first one.  What I like to call as U.S. (unnessary scenes: nudity, sex etc.) took up more than half of these actors' energy to wind up with an ending so uncalled for.  I'd also like to mention that at the end of the movie, which I saw on DVD, I took the time to actually view the trailers.  The one for the CRUEL INTENTIONS 2 showed many scenes that weren't in the movie.  I think this might have been due to the fact that I read today in one of the reviews that there was suppose to be a series called MANCHESTER PREP or something and it was rejected, good!  I just wanted to spare anyone who read this feeling like a (dumb ...) for even watching this movie.
