If you love this movie, as I do, don't buy this DVD.  Years ago a restored version with added sequences was released on VHS.  Great effort was put into the restoration and the added scenes were funny and they greatly improved the flow of the movie.  The restoration was released with great fanfare and has appeared on TV several times.  Now for some reason MGM has released the pre-restoration version on DVD.  After years of seeing the restored version, watching this DVD is wrenching.  Scenes I've become accustomed to seeing are missing (relegated  to a collection of deleted scenes on the DVD's flipside) and the whole experiece is like watchng a movie edited for comercial television (and we all know how annoying that is).  I have only myself to blame for getting stuck with this DVD.  It never occured to me that MGM would pull something like this.  I think it's obvious that they intend to put out a better version in the future.  Even the packaging of this DVD is lame, they don't even make use of the famous cast caricature painting by Jack Davis.  MGM put this version out knowing that later when they put out a decent version people like me will buy it again.  Don't get played like that; avoid this DVD and wait for the real thing.
