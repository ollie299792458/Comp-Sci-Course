I am an artist and went to this movie hoping to see some beautiful art and got more than I had hoped for. I would say this is the most beautiful animation I have ever seen. I am a painter and I like the old masters including the traditional subject matter they paint; pastoral scenes drapery figures etc. This is the first animation, digital or traditional,  I have seen that has convincing and beautiful representation of all these things.
I have studied and been a fan of disney animation art for years, and as blasphemous as it may be to say this, stepping back and looking at the big picture, I think this surpasses classics such as snow white and pinocchio. The original drawings and watercolor paintings for those old classics are among my favorite works of art, and I doubt that the studies and original art for this and other recent animation is as beautiful, but I think the final resulting movie is even more beautiful because of the lighting and the impact of the increased realism. Also those old movies are dark; in mood, and also visually. Tangled has night scenes with beautiful bottom lighting etc, but the daylight scenes really feel like day - filled with sunlight - I find this uplifting and I bet kids do too on a subconscious level. I seems appropriate to entertainment for kids
I like toy story, monsters inc, finding nemo and many other recent animations, but Tangled, because of the setting, has things that the human soul loves, green pastoral scenes, quaint towns and castles, lights reflected in water, all created with wonderful feeling (and refinement that is head and shoulders above animation of such subject matter done in the 1960's, 70's 80's or 90's) . My favorite yet.
