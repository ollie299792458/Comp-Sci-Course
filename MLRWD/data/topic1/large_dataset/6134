I really expected to like The Blind Side. Goodness had I heard good things about it, and from people whom I respect. And I didn't hate it. But I don't really expect that I'll watch it again ever.

A couple of things annoyed me. First, some of these metaphors were really heavy-handed. The "blind side" metaphor, especially in that embarrassing scene at football practice, lost its resonance when the film explained it over and over to you. Second, I didn't like the cartoonishness in the film. I'm all for inspiring, rags-to-riches stories and for moments of humor. Humor, no matter how difficult life is, is present in just about any situation. But I thought that the cartoonish quality to this film really did detract from the very serious social issues of the real story. Compare The Blind Side with Slum-Dog Millionaire. Both are stories of men emerging from horrific, hopeless situations, but in Slum-Dog Millionaire, those issues are depicted without pulling punches. The Blind Side may be based on a true story, but as the story's told, it's more the fantasy than Slum-Dog.

The strength of the movie is really the story that it's based upon, some of which leaks through the filmmaking. And I've always liked Bullock, and she's fine here (though this does seem to me like one of the sillier Oscar choices in recent times). But I really wish it weren't all so silly.
