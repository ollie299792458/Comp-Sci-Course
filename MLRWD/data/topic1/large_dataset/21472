We watched this movie with two teens and three young adults -- we all LOVED it. "First Knight" now ranks as one of our favorite movies of all time. Sean Connery is perfect in his role as King Arthur. And we were happily surprised with the versatile, athletic performance Richard Gere pulls off in this film as Lancelot -- a far cry from several of his later movies where he typically portrays a "stiff" businessman figure. There was ZERO cussing in this movie -- that in itself was refreshing! And enough action and daring to keep the four men in our group satisfied...

Guinevere, as Princess of her tiny province, is unable to defend her people from the marauding Malagant whose ultimate goal is to usurp Arthur from Camelot. Out of love and duty to her people, Guinevere accepts an offer of marriage from King Arthur -- who had been a great friend of her father's. While this is a marriage of joy for Arthur, it is a marriage of expedience on Guinevere's part -- not one of the heart. While she is sincerely attracted to Arthur's character strengths and political beliefs, he is old enough to be her father. Before Guinevere reaches her wedding day, she is kidnapped and single-handedly rescued twice by the daring young Lancelot -- who succeeds because he cares for no one, not even himself. But his bitterness with life is about to change. As his heart burns for Guinevere, Lancelot's growing respect for King Arthur brings him to the honorable decision of leaving Camelot...  The magnificence of King Arthur's lifelong concern for the welfare of others over himself comes through in a grand finale of forgiveness and blessing.
