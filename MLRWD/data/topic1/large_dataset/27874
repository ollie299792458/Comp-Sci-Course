This movie is a bourne wannabe.  Centered around the CIA and intelligence community, it has lots of fast action with hand-held cameras and frequent cuts within each scene.  I'd say it's a fairly well directed movie with good cinematography.

Where it falls short, in my opinion, is the characters - and particularly the main character.  The main character is a youngish agent who is proprietor of a safe house.  He's bored; and he wants to prove himself.  He has a girlfriend - and he tells her that he's in some benign profession (he doesn't want her to know he's CIA).

Denzel Washington plays a renegade (former) agent carrying some high-stakes intel.

The main character (the youngish agent, who's name escapes me) remains undeveloped throughout the movie.  And as a consequence, I had no reason to care about him.  Denzel Washington's character was marginally developed; and I barely cared about him.  The young agent's girlfriend communicated her feelings fairly well (although she had hardly any part to play in the movie); and by the end of the movie, I cared about her.

Despite the fast action and constant threats against the two main characters, I found the movie generally boring.  So I say to the writers, the director, and the actors:  make me care!

And by the way, the red lipstick on that CIA woman just drove me crazy!
