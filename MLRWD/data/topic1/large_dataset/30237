I had to wait until this one came to video because it did not come to the theater in my town. I was anxious to see it after hearing all the good buzz surrounding it. I was not disappointed. This movie is raw human emotion..it holds nothing back. I was captivated by the Bolger sisters and their absolutely heartbreaking performances. Samantha Morton rightfully deserved her Oscar nomination, and had it not been for Charlize Theron's mesmerizing portrayal of Aileen Wuornos in Monster, she would've won. We see into each character's struggles to make it in America, and how the two girls, despite their young ages, are the glue that keeps everything together and keep hope alive. Djimon Hounsou also gives a great supporting performance as a disease stricken neighbor the girls grow to love and whom, in the end, becomes an angel of sorts for the family. I could not keep my eyes off the screen and I truly felt for this family and everything they endured. Kudos to everyone involved in this film. Truly a work of art.
