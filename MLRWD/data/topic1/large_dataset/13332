This movie (panned by many critics) had been one of my favorites over the years.  My wife thinks I'm nuts becauseI believe that "U-Turn" had a great many redeeming values...a classic tragedy in my mind.  I am only providing this benchmark so that my opinion of the DVD version of "Missouri Breaks" can be put into context.

There is no point in rehashing the plot details because they are amply covered in other reviews.  What I will talk about is the technical details of this release.

The movie, as originally released, had an "R" rating.  Therin was most of it's edginess as a western.  The language was more contemporary as in "Deadwood".  I know that it is silly to suggest that naughty language can make a movie, however at the time this movie was released it was somewhat a novelty and refreshing...especially for a Western.  A scene of Jack Nicholson's where he is lamenting the fact that he had to hang around the ranch and maintain the garden while the rest of the gang went off to Canada to rustle some horses is classic as originally rendered.  Near comparable to the rye toat scene in "Five Easy Pieces", unfortunately the "PG" version does nothave the "punch".

One highlight of this release is that the video transfer is beautiful.  The scenery (filmed on location in Montana)is spectacular...near worth the $12 I paid for the DVD.
