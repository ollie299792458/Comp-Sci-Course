I must say that "Puss In Boots" is a very creative and dynamic movie that is suitable for all ages.  Antonio Banderas brilliantly plays the role of the cat "Puss In Boots" who is back to engage in a journey to reclaim his honor.  Salma Hayek also does a clever performance as "Kitty Softpaws". Kitty Softpaws  ends up accompanying Puss in Boots in his quest to restore his reputation, and capture magic beans.  Zach Galifianakis (from the Hangover movie) plays the role of Humpty Dumpty. Humpty Dumpty is a past friend of Puss in Boots and greatly shapes his character evolution through subtle psychological tests.  Billy Bob Thornton (of the Bad Santa movie) and Amy Sedaris play the "outlaws" Jack and Jill.  Jack and Jill have the magic beans that Puss in Boots wants to covet.  My only caveat with this film is that Jack and Jill were intentionally made to be overweight, plain-looking, and evil.  This reinforces the stereotype that only attractive people are capable of humanity and compassion.  It is common knowledge that there are beautiful people that are both cold and calculating. I would have liked to see villain characters that reflected "wolf in sheep's clothing" rather than the usual generic stereotype of only plain people being abrasive.  Aside from this, "Puss in Boots" is an engaging animation movie.  I would highly recommend this film for anyone that enjoyed any of the Shrek films.
