I may only be 16, but ive seen every episode of the original Beverly Hills 90210, which was without a doubt better than this, BY FAR. 90210 on the cw, was a dreadful disappointment. i love teen dramas and tv for that matter. i mean the two best tv shows in history in my opinon were/are The O.C. (But not on TV anymore) and One Tree Hill (Coming To It's 7th Season). those shows have good writing and are down to earth. 90210 was out-of-this-world and i dont think any teenager could relate to their lives in anyyway, unless you know a pregnant teenage girl, bi-polar teenage girl, and an orphaned guy all in the same social circle.. i mean, the show is so 'Fabulous' i dont even think kids with the fabulous life could relate. i was excited for this new show, because ive seen Beverly Hills 90210 and i play lacrosse (which it feautures BRIEFLY), but i was disappointed.. not only do they screw up their own storylines, but their pilot episode was so simular to Beverly Hills 90210 it was almost like the replicated it, but added terrible writing. the lighting is also terribly tooooooooooo bright. i can't even start to explain how terrible this show is. if you want to see real Dramas dont watch this. buy THE O.C. or watch ONE TREE HILL (7th season premiere Sept 14), or even watch GOSSIP GIRL(Which is a little better at least!!!!) JUST DON'T WATCH THIS STUPID SHOW!

oh, but i have to say, watch 'Reaper', same station, same night, it is a good show. so even though this show sucks, still watch Reaper, cuz it RULES!
