At last the full 3 hour Frankenstein, The True Story is available.  With a photographic memory, I was appalled the first time I watched my VHS version and realized there was more surgery on the movie than there was on the creature.  I was particularly floored by the omission of a significant Agnes Moorehead scene, as I adore this talented woman.  (Was this her last role?)  I agree with others that the Amazon review cannot be further from the mark.  This film could not be LESS "camp".  Although it is not entirely the "True" story, it is such a classy telling of the tale, that it has inspired me to buy and finally read the book.  My only complaint is that the color of the DVD is fair at best.  Even with constant fiddling with my TV's settings, the best I could come up with was a rusty brown tint to the majority of the film...Also, if you have never seen the film or lack my kind of memory from seeing it in 1973, skip the James Mason intro--it let's too much out!  Special mention to David McCallum--he is impeccable as Clerval, and his acting certainly deserved an Emmy.  Leanord Whiting's Victor Frankenstein is perfect.  Watch it on a rainy night!
