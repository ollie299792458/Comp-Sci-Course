first of all yes this was a flawed series but the good by far outweighed the bad(the bad being chocolate and homecoming neither of which could remotely be considered horror though they were horrible).as for the reviewer who wondered why they didnt release a boxed set coinciding with the individual dvds the answer is greed the same reason companies always double or triple dip they knew it would make $$$ from diehard fans which though i am a diehard i only bought 3 because i knew this would happen as it will with season 2.as for the reviewer who hated the whole set and apparently everyone associated with it they obviously dont like horror movies because though the rest werent all great several were the only ones that sucked were the aforementioned atrocities chocolate and homecoming and also if that reviewer is so great why arent they blowing the minds of horror fans with their brilliant movies?i felt i had to defend this series from critics who obviously have problems with anchorbay for their own lack of patience or those who hate horror and suffer from delusions that their opinion matters(for the record my opinion doesnt and shouldnt matter either but its just as valid and moreso to me as anyone elses and im not turning people away from or otherwise disparaging talented and creative not to mention successful artists or their work with the exceptions of joe dante and mick garris' contributions)
