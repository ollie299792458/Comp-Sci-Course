Great musical theatre is about great performances.  This documentary claims to be about the American Musical but it ignores its legends such as Ethel Merman, Mary Martin, Gwen Verdon, Alfred Drake, John Raitt, Carol Channing etc...  This documentary appears enamored with Sondheim - highlighting and praising everything he's ever done - even Pacific Overtures.  But Damn Yankees, Dreamgirls, and Grease, one of the longest running musicals in Broadway history, are totally ignored.  Who made this?  The makers of this documentary appear to have some sort of agenda with their selective presentation of American Musical history highlighting the data that they think you ought to know.  They made this documentary for themselves and their constituents - certainly not for the theatre fans.

The theatre is about life.  This documentary is inanimate.  This documentary is anemic, eye-crossing and so boring that even the most devout theatre fan would be lulled into a coma after the first hour.  The makers of this mess missed the boat entirely.  What a disappointment!  Avoid this stinker.
