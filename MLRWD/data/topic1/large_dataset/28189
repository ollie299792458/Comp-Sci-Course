An outstanding film, Monster's Ball, brings to the screen the love story between an unlikely couple in the South with all the ups and downs that that entails!

It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.

Billy Bob Thornton, Halle Berry (who is GORGEOUS!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.

The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!

In short, Monster's Ball is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!
