I heard on NPR radio that Walmart is the largest seller of DVDs. Walmart apparently has enough influence that movie studios are releasing more movies with pg and pg-13 ratings because nudity is a no-no with Walmart, who absolutely will not carry NC-17 or sex driven r rated releases.(R for violence is okay, from what I heard on NPR)

 This may carry over to edgy tv shows like Third Rock. I bought my set at Walmart for $19.95 the day it was released.

There are many episodes where Sally's sexuality is central to the plot but I didn't see any cuts in the first season DVD that were "morals" driven.

 Versions of tv shows for syndication are notorious for editing out so called non-essential segments so local stations can add a few more commercials. But I think the studios should know that anyone who is paying for a series expects to get the original. In fact, it may be illegal to sell them without disclosing that it is the syndicated version. Anyone who has purchased this set could probably get their money back because of this.

 I bought "Threes Company" year three, and is wasn't cut, so this could be an isolated occurance.

Anyway, buy this set. Third Rock was a great show. I remember John Lithgow on Saturday Night Live in the "Master Thespian" skit with John Lovett. I had no idea he could do comedy. I think TRFTS premiered the year after his appearance on SNL.
