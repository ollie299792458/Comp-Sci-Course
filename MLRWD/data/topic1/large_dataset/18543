This film has all the "hip" topics for a serious seventies feature film, environmentalism, generation gap issues, paranoia, and even drug/heroin addiction, but add in a smattering of zombies and gore, and this Spanish/Italian production shot in England becomes an instant genre classic.

The film is a little slow to get started as several intertwining story lines get developed (overdeveloped really), but once the first zombie appears, the plot clears the fog line and really moves forward. There's lots of good frights and good bloody zombie cannibalism, including a great scene involving a hospital receptionist and three half-dressed male zombies (hmm...what's that one zombie reaching for?).

Despite the big environmental push of the opening credits, the subplot really narrows down to a generation gap issue between an irascible old police sergeant and a young, hip, long-haired London professional, who through a series of untimely events, finds himself unfairly immersed in a nightmare in the English countryside. The film has good level of paranoia for the youth of the seventies. Our young protagonist fights the good fight, but it's against big odds. No one will believe him as he tries to expose the zombies and the cause for the walking dead. Society just doesn't want to hear the truth and refuses to listen to its youth. Eventually, he finds himself battling not only the bloodthirsty cannibals, but also the police sergeant, whose tunnel vision and prejudice has caused him to not only peg our young hero (and his kind) as a devil-worshiping thrill killer, but also as the reason for all of societies ills.

There's a little bit of unintentional silliness, but this never gets in the way of the story. Good gore. Good shocks, Great fire scenes. Zombie fans will like this one, but don't pair or compare with something like 28 Days Later. It's a lot closer to Night of the Living Dead. Enjoy!
