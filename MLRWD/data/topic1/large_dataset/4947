Rita Hayworth radiates superabundant sensuality as the magnetic center of this film. Hayworth's beauty stands outside of time; her changing moods and expressions affect us powerfully, at a pre- or nonverbal level. (Therefore most attempts to analyze this film fail, beyond general statements about Hayworth as an iconic femme fatale). There is an overwhelming ambiguous sexuality permeating the film, almost palpable, which also explains its enduring appeal. Ballin (George Macready) voyeuristically pushes Johnny (Glenn Ford) toward his wife Gilda (Hayworth). But there is an equally strong sexual attraction/undercurrent between Ballin and Johnny throughout, never resolved, and the "happy ending" has a tacked-on quality, as though merely to satisfy convention and audience expectations. The strange nature of love and love-hate is wonderfully explored by this unusual love triangle. A very handsome and suave Argentine police official/detective (Joseph Calleia) is thrown in for good measure. This film deals with eternal truths about masculinity, femininity, and the dark, complex and unpredictable forces of sexuality. How the U.S. could have slipped into the anodyne sanitized 1950s after films like this is a mystery to me. Watching Hayworth perform makes it clear that most so-called "stars" of today are absurd nonentities.
