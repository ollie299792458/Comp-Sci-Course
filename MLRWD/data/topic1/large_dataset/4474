I was very satisfied with my viewing experience after renting this DVD.  Back when this film hit theaters, I wasn't Hollywood Denzel vehicle ("John Q", "Out of Time") and I had better ways to spend my time.  Now I stand corrected, and realize the film was just poorly and misleadingly marketed...but what else is new in the world of movie trailers.  Anyway I didn't have the highest expectations of it, but I was thoroughly surprised and impressed after watching it at home one evening.  If you have a nice home theater setup, you'll really appreciate the serene music and sound design of this movie.  Great 5.1 audio.  The video quality of the DVD is beautiful as well.

Back to the movie - I won't give away plot details, but let's just say it's an original approach to the kidnapping/thriller concept.  I really enjoyed the tone of the film and thought it was paced perfectly.  There are two (or three) distinct acts of the script, and after the transition from act one to act two, you're hooked.  One word of caution to those turned off by violence:  there is not a good amount of it in this film, but the violence here is gritty and realistic.  However, based on the context of the violence in the film I thought it was perfectly acceptable and was not in bad taste at all.

One minor complaint: I thought the exaggerated subtitles got a bit annoying.  You'll know what I mean after watching the film.  At first I really liked the way they employed this, but there was a point where I thought "OK, I get it", but it just kept happening.  Minor quibble, that's all.
