I love watching american movies not because I like the US of A but because american film makers spent so much time, effort, money and dedication in bringing to audiences around the world great movies such as BLADE II...one of the great action movie I have seen so far!!!This film is superbly done!Great action choregraphy better than Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon!!!And this is the first really,of all the vampire films I've seen, that how a vampire should die its like being eaten by fire coming from the inside the CGI really compliments the action.The story is ok although it could have been done with the character of kris kristofferson (no bad personal intention) differently say becoming a truly bad vampire...anyhow just a suggestion...
I could have given this 10 star but you can only give a max of 5 star!!!Last thing this review is based on the VCD format so I can't wait to order the DVD version just to fully experience the DD 5.1 and DTS sound format I'm sure this gonna blow me away!!!!
