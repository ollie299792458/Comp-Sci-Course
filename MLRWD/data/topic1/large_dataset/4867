Those who are fans of Clint Eastwood know that when Clint makes a movie, he is always saying something about what he feels a man should be.  "The Unforgiven" in many ways, is one of his best movies and one of the most visual in its depiction of what a man is, and especially, what a man was in the Wild West, and the transitions that man tried to make, sometimes successfully, and sometimes not.
His morality is pure in this film.  He is an ex-gunfighter who has seen the good way of the Lord, thanks to his wife.  He is in some financial difficulties, and so, he takes a job that is a "kill for hire" job.  The film portrays beautifully, the conflict within a man, as he faces the option of actually killing another man.  In several ways, Clint makes this point.
And while Clint and his partners get paid, it seems a very bittersweet ending as in the process, the great tragedy of the loss of his friend's life to torture occurred.  So little is known really about what makes a person do some of the things they do, and yet, Clint makes these almost ephemeral feelings come to life visually, in this film.
In some ways, perhaps Clint's very best film, "The Unforgiven" is not only a wonderful "period piece" but also, truly a statement on the character of people.
