I suspect that most who purchase a music DVD are already fans of an artist music CD(s).  It should be no surprise then that the comments that are left for the DVD are a bit prejudicial.  So I'll gush -
I am no fan of music DVD's in general, however, when I saw that Kate Rusby was releasing a video of a live concert I was willing to make an exception.  Yorkshire and Scotland are far far away from Texas.  Video is much cheaper.
The Leeds theater was an excellant choice of venues for the filming.  The sound in the theater seemed very nice (the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound picked it up well) and the atmosphere allowed for a little play between the audience and the band.  The crowd appeared appreciative but somewhat subdued.  There were no outbursts or spontaneous displays of jigs in the isles.
The musicians are superb.  Their sound is polished parlor at its best.  There is so much more to this music than simple support for Kate's magical voice.  These guys are the real deal.  John McCusker performs with several different instruments and he displays his vast talent with each on this DVD.
The song selection is virtually perfect.  There is a nice blend of familiar tunes with new and unrecorded songs; sad ballads and an acapella comedy.  Pick your preference; sing along, be amused, sit and center, or weep, and be entertained all the way through.  There is not a mediocre track on the DVD.
The 87 minutes of performance is backed with almost an equal time of extas.  One interview reference to Nancy Griffith makes me think the band should come experience the Gulf Coast Highway in person some blue bonnet spring.
Buy it, rent it, or barrow it!  Especially if you're like me and can't hop a airplane to Europe for a show.
