I must admit, I was a little skeptical when this movie first came out. But after watching it, I have to say. WHAT MORE DID YOU WANT!!!!!, this movie delivers in more ways than one. In response to one reviewer, I've seen the original Mummy movie, woooooooooooooow, I had a hard time trying to keep from getting bored. All they did, was update the movie, story and all. This time the Mummy is actually scary, he actually looks like he came back from the dead. And the scarabs, they are a character in this movie all by themselves. Surprise surprise surprise, when you give Brendan Fraser a very good script, and don't ask him to do too much. He's a very good actor, there is chemistry between him and Rachel weisz. The only update on the story, is that instead on Imhotep falling in love with A queen named Anucksananum, it's the pharoe's mistress. I won't rehash the plot, I like the fact that Brendan Fraser plays Rick O'connell as a man of action. It's not even close to boring, I enjoyed this movie. It was well written, well directed, and very well acted.
