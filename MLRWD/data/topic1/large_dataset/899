You can't see it, you can't hear it (and in one release, there were actually subtitles for the English-speaking actors)--but there are those who consider this mess cinematic genius. But then the French believe Jerry Lewis is a comedic genius. This unfortunate mess has within it a darn good film about the Johnson County War and it has a really terrific cast (including Willem Dafoe in his movie debut). But as a whole, it is a waste of time, talent, and celluloid. I have seen the uncut and cut versions, so editing won't help it. Not only did this film sink troubled United Artist but also the entire Western genre. The treatment of animals on the set  prompted the Screen Actors Guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers to contractually authorize the American Humane Association to monitor the use of all animals in all filmed media. It's been more than 10 years since Michael Cimino's name has been attached to an American film. I understand that he is directing or will direct an adaptation of Andre Malraux's 1933 novel Man's Fate. I don't know what to say. Maybe if you haven't seen it, you should. Although not the worst movie ever made, it's an ambitious film with nothing to say. Much of the movie is beautiful to look at but so much of it is shot at twilight that even the scenery is lost on you. Because Cimino doesn't seem to know or understand the people he put on the screen, he is incapable of telling their story. The same contempt that Cimino had for the people in Deer Hunter, is evident here.
