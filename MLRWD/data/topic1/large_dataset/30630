I am a huge fan of the Die Hard series (not so much the second, but even it merits a look).  It's safe to say that if you see John McClane in a building, airplane, or telephone booth (maybe even a doughnut shop) you better run like heck because said structure will be blown up (or at the least riddled with bullets) within seconds.  Bruce Willis is the ultimate every-day hero with flaws and a biting sense of humor, as he is raised from the bottom of the bottle he has drowned himself in to battle again with an uber-terrorist bent on worldly domination (played deliciously by the always entertaining Jeremy Irons who I feel plays some of the best bad guys in the business).  Sounds too much like the first?  Heck no, because there is a high-octane, adrenaline-packed side kick in the form Samuel L. Jackson (that's Zeus, not Jesus) who provides amusement in the form of his one-line zingers, yet still able to open up a can of self-righteous whoop on the enemy.  It's a virtual feast for the senses with dazzling special effects, a great soundtrack and fast-paced dialogue (what else would you expect from razor-witted Bruce).  The characters are rich, multi-dimensional beings whom you can empathize with, or wonder how depraved they truly can be.  It's definitely a film that you can watch over and over, seeing something new each time you do so.
