I'm not a huge fan of martial arts movies and had no idea what to expect when I first saw this film. But it wouldn't have made any difference, because the first choreographed scene of the "axe gang" swinging their wares would have shattered any amount of preconception.

The hero, Sing, is a disappointed young man who wanted to be...well...a hero. But when his younger self purchased a pamphlet promising the ultimate secret in martial arts it took almost no time at all to get his butt kicked half way to America. Now he's living in squalor, committing petty crimes, and longing to pass the initiation and join the powerful Axe Gang.

But poor Sing's heart isn't in it and every time he tries to do something bad he gets his butt kicked again. Against this backdrop, an increasingly powerful, exotic, and inventive array of martial artists line up on either side of the escalating tension between the Axe gang and Sing's slum.

Kung Fu Hustle is full of twists and turns, witty satire on martial arts movie, and amazing special effects. But it's the human story of a young man's search for redemption that won my heart and gives the DVD pride of place on my shelf.
