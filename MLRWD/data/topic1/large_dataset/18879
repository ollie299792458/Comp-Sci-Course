Alfred Hitchcock said that "there is a terrifying meaning lurking right underneath the surface of The Birds."  This meaning has heretofore been kept a strict secret among British and American intellectuals.  After a long and feverish struggle with my conscience over the matter, I've decided that for the benefit of mankind the sequestering of this knowledge must cease -- and what better time than on the film's 40th anniversary!
The knotty root of this secret is contained in the title itself.  A cursory glance at a dictionary of British slang will give you the translation bird=girl.  The explication of the various connections that the film makes between the weaker sex and the avian order is left to the reader.
There's not much more to it than that.  The film is frequently misclassified by the uninitiated: it's not a horror movie, not a man-vs-nature tale, not a piece of science fiction (the latter category  was explicitly disavowed by it's creators).  It is simply Hitchcock's allegory about the destructiveness and ugliness of the female psyche in its various manifestations -- mother, lover, rival, child, friend.
But to say that Hitch was a misogynist would only be half right.  Like his Plato, Dr. Sigmund F., he took a dim -- dark, really -- view of the whole race.  In fact, Hitchcock slaved himself so thoroughly to Freudianism that he made a separate assessment of the value of his own work problematic.  How deep can an allegory go?  Culture critic Camile Paglia thinks "The Birds" is more profound than I do.  It's really only as deep as Siggy himself, but art can and should be deeper than psychology -- or any science.  Four stars, not five.
