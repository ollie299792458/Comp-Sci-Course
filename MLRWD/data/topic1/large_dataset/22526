I've been a fan and avid watcher of this series since the first season, and make no mistake, Season Seven is Sensational.  I've only watched 8 episodes so far, and although the pace of the series is fast, it still maintains what the show intended from season one.  The story lines and plot twists make this show, at least for me, addictive.  This show is pure genius and i wait in anticipation, along with everyone else to see how this concludes and finally ends.  I too, hope this show doesn't run out of gas and become a disappointment considering the journey we've taken with the Man of Steel for seven years now.  I've just read a lot of reviews of crititcs of this show who gave it a very low rating and all i can say is that this is just television. You know, entertainment.  It's an indepth point of view of the arrival and the life of the most heralded superhero of all time.  Not the rewriting of the Holy Scriptures.  So don't give credence to these ranters who write paragraph after paragraph who expect everything and say basically nothing.  Buy this series and enjoy and let's get ready for a great season eight.
