I just saw this movie tonight and I liked it. Obviously you should not expect Oscar worthy acting from Mr. Reeves but overall the film was very well done.

Reeves plays John Constantine, a man on earth who has been to hell and back. He now sees demons (well, half demons which he labels half-breeds) on earth and performs exorcisms to send them back to hell... He knows that Hell is his fate because he does not fit the critera for Heaven (since he sees good and evil, and has seen Hell he does not have Faith, one can't have faith if one knows the truth) so he is destined for the prison where he has send half of the inmates. He is obviously not going to be greeted warmly.

When a female police detective approaches Constantine after her sister commits suicide he sets out to help her know if and why her sister (twin) killed herself....

I liked it. The FX were great and the story line was very interesting. What isn't interesting about Heaven and Hell? We all wonder about such things. I particularly enjoyed the interruption of Hell, and feel the FX were very well done... If you're into horror/sci fi / action films this is deff one worth checking out.
