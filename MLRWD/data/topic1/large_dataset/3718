I originally liked this a lot when I first saw it about 6 years ago.  I recently read the book and then watched it again.  Having read the book, I'm somewhat less impressed with this production.  I understand condensing.  However, it's hard to condone cutting crucial plot elements just so we can see extra scenes with McFayden romping in the woods.  Oh well, I guess they needed to make it more appealing to the masses.

That said, this is still great for certain performances- Suchet in particular.  I simply loved his performance.

Certain casting choices were questionable- It's already been said before, but Miranda Otto really was a poor choice.  Couldn't they find an actual American actress for this role?

I can't find any real fault in Cillian Murphy's performance.  However, physically, he just wasn't the right actor for this role.  From certain angles he looks more like a young girl than a man.  His walking around in a cowboy hat bordered on the ridiculous.

Again, see it for Souchet.
