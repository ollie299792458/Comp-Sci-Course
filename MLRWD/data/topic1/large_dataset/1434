I had seen reviews on this site that absolutely trashed this movie asking questions such as, "How did he avoid hired killers?" "How did he dodge bullets?" "How did he know how to operate the machine?" etc, etc... then I actually saw the movie. Keeping in mind people will have their own opinion of it, but I have to say for my money this movie was great.
I looked at the ratings and the ratings were so evenly spread out I couldn't believe it. I realize, after reading a number of reviews, a lot of people didn't completely understand the plot of the movie, but they trashed it anyway. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, but there's a reason that everything looks so unbelievable. That's the beauty of this story line. There's no real explanation needed if you're paying attention to what going on.
Most of the reviewers that were wondering why these unbelievable things were happening missed the whole point. If they fully comprehended the story line they wouldn't asked the questions they did.
I know I'm being vague, but that's to make sure I don't give anything away. What I'm going to say was already in the trailer. No need to worry about me spoiling any scenes. If you dare to venture to watch the film be aware that Ben Afleck is a reverse engineer and he's the best in the business at what he does, so understand that it's his job to know exactly how the computers he's reverse engineering works. That by itself should eliminate most of the confusion (if any) about this movie. You just have to connect the dots. Don't step away for popcorn, pay attention to the story and you should be very much into this movie.
A lot twists and turns, action and great fun. If you don't enjoy this movie, don't kill the messenger... (eh... I'm mean reviewer).
