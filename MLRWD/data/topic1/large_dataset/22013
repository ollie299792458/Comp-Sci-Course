I have to be totally honest, I am a HUGE wrestling fan and Kane is my favorite superstar. So maybe with that being said I may be a lil Bias. But anyway i thought that this film went above and beyond my expectaions. I actually planned on going to see this film and probably hating myself afterwards because lets be honest. WWE Films, they dont specialize in making movie, they specialize in sports entertainment so I thought this was more less going to be a flop. Much to my suprise I was DEAD WRONG!!! My god i absolutely loved this film. One of the many things I loved about this is this movie didnt take long to get going, The killings were immediate. This movie wasted no time what so ever. I think another plus about this movie was the Kane had NO DIALOGUE. He said 2 or 3 words the entire film. But when your that size you dont need to talk. Glen Jacobs (KANE) did a awesome preformance and I think he should possibly win something for best villian.

Anyway, wrestling fan or not, if your a fan of good horror movies (which for the longest time i believed they couldnt make anymore) This effort proved me wrong and put a smile on my face all through the film.

GO SEE THIS FILM, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED!!!!!
