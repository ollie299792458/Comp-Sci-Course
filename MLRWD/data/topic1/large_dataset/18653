First off let me start by saying that this is not reveiw of the plot but of the film it's self, and if the other reviewers would have listened to the audio commentary on this film they would realize this WAS a sequel to Texas Chainsaw Massacre part 1 & part 2, Stretch the radio dj who survived part 2 is in this one! She plays a news reporter, but it' a quick cameo and a character which was suppose to be Chop Top from part 2 was turned into the character of Alfredo, the insane gas station owner (played like a more deranged Hitchhiker from part 1 by Tom Everett). Even Drayton Sawyer is given a nod to when one of the brothers, the hook handed redneck Tinker (played by the fantastic Joe Unger) makes Leatherface a chromed out chainsaw with Drayton's famous line from TCM 2 engraved on it "The saw is family". The characters of Tex and Benny really steal the show though, both are well played and Tex (played by the great Viggo Mortensen) is a really good bad guy in the film, Benny (played by horror icon Ken Foree) is just a plain bad, butt kicking dude who exacts revenge opon the crazy inbred family. The other family members Mama and Leatherface's daughter are a nice female fit to the Sawyers, they are really creepy also. The final girl in the film is well played by Kate Hodge and is very believable as a victim, Grandpa also shows up (although he is a corpse, because of his death in TCM part 2), and Leatherface is turned into a raging behemoth and way less child-like than his first two appearances (this also being explained on the commentary). Overall this is a great entry into the Chainsaw franchise and IS a great sequel to the other two shocking TCM films, though i only recommend the unrated version (it makes more sense), the price is great also!
