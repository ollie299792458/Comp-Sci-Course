I love this movie in its original black and white.  My opinion, without doubt, the best of all the filmed CHRISTMAS CAROLS.  Alastair Sim is the Scrooge for the ages.  So the question is, does colorization make this film better or improve it in any way? The answer is no.  It can't be improved because it's already perfect. But colorization certainly does add an element of fun in watching it after repeated b&w viewings.  And if colorization gets younger viewers to watch this wonderful movie, than it's more than a gimmick.  It's a tool to encourage those not familiar with the film classics to give them a look.
As far as the actual colorization goes, I really don't see much improvement in the process in all the years it's been around.  Having said that, this film sort of lends itself to the process however because of the locale and nature of the storytelling so the faded, less than crisp colors don't detract from the picture and can almost seem like they might belong.  More important than the colorization, is the added feature in this package of the widescreen presentation of the black and white version which looks terrific!
So if you are a fan of the movie and would like to see what it looks like colorized (and I admit I always do like to see the colorization of the classics just for the fun of it) or even if you would like to see the b&w version in widescreem (I'm really not sure how they achieved this cause it wasn't filmed in widescreen but looks here like it really was:  no distortion or zoom-like cutoffs at all!) or if you are a collector of anything A CHRISTMAS CAROL, then I happily recommend this version to you.  Happy Holidays!
PS:  For us collectors of A CHRISTMAS CAROL, this packaging is pretty nifty, too!
