I saw this picture 14 times at the old Mayfair Theatre on a double bill with The Parent Trap,(a great Hayley Mills Flic!)Back in the days when it cost 25 cents. (Twice a day for 7 days that is!) I have it on VHS, and plan to upgrade to DVD. You can't go wrong owning this film,as it may be John Waynes' best acting role in a western. The paring of the Duke with Jeffrey Hunter was genius,and the cinematography,(Monument Valley),is breathtaking! After Ethan (the Duke),returns home from the Civil War,he finds his closest family members wiped out in a renegade indian raid,except for Lucy,(a young Natalie Wood),whom the Commanches have taken for their own. The relentless hunt is on,through the four brutal seasons,and over years,Ethan is obsessed with finding 'Scar' the chief of the Commanches,and avenging his families death. Excellent action,and and excellent plot,with a surprise ending. The savageness and desperation that faced the early western pioneers is well-portrayed by FORD,in what I believe is his best collaberation with John Wayne. Great supporting cast,with the likes of Vera Miles and Ward Bond. It was my priviledge to review this great epic,and I recommend it most highly. - Ron Larocque
