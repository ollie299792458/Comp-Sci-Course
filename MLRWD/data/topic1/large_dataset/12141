I enjoyed the movie and subject matter becauase I am a history buff. I would have enjoyed it more if some of the characters were further developed, and a little less time was spent on the other characters, such as the young man's love interest. Moving into the subject matter of the film, even more interesting is the fact that even today, Turks and Turkish sympathizers continue to deny the atrocities commited by the Ottoman Empire against the Armenians.  Such as the character played by Koteas in the movie.  Even today the Turks continue to disparage and/or deny the atrocities commited by the Turkish government much to the horor of the Armenian families who were victims of the holocaust. Generally it is the position of most Turks and Turkish government proponents that either the Armenian genocide did not occur, or it is grossly exaggerated. Like the holocaust is exaggerated?  Interesting argument, however, sadly for them, and more deeply hurtful to the Armenians, and other victims of genocide/holocaust such as the jews, denial of the occurence of history only firms up the convictions of the survivors or successors to dig deeper and push harder. To conclude, although clearly not Schindler's List or the Pianist in its nature and quality, I believe this movie, although a little rough around the edges, is a very interesting look at a very dark side of human history.
