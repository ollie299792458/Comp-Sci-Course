I love this movie! It has been one of my personal favorites for years. Tom Selleck is at his best in the title role of Matthew Quigley, a long-distance sharp shooter who has been hired by a rancher [the always great Alan Rickman] in Australia to rid his property of some unwanted "pests". Quigley of course won't do the job once he learns what he is hunting, so the rancher has his men beat the him nearly to death and then tells them to dump his body 2 days ride from his ranch and "let Australia kill him!" Quigley of course survives and spends the rest of the film heading back to the ranch to make the rancher and his men pay for what they have done. Along for the ride is Laura San Giacomo as "Crazy" Cora, the woman who mistakes Quigley for her long lost husband Roy. Director Simon Wincer [Lonesome Dove] does a great job weaving the story together and Basil Poledouris' [Robocop] quirky score is quite memorable.

The Blu-ray transfer on the film is absolutely gorgeous and the audio mix is really well done too. The package is quite light on the extras but to see this film in it's HD glory is well worth the price...which brings me to the point of my review.

This Blu-ray is supposed to be a Wal-Mart "exclusive" [which is where I purchased my copy] so how it is the listed seller here has these Blus for sale on Amazon I can only guess. I can't blame a guy for trying to make a living, but $35 is a bit outrageous...especially in today's economy and when the supposed "exclusive" provider of this Blu-ray is selling them for $10 a piece.

Where ever you decide to buy them...if your a fan of the film and have the full HD home theater...you won't be disappointed in the upgrade from standard def.
