My kids were mad I chose this movie to review since they thought it was going to be dumb.  They were pleasantly surprised that they actually enjoyed it.  The under ten crowd laughed lots and the older kids made good  comments and have even re-watched it.  From my perspective I wish I hadn't gotten it.  I hate to buy movies unless I've seen them because chances are it's not worth owning.  I disliked the potty talk, the not quite swearing like "What the mother goose", tons of name calling and even a scene where the squirrel is acting like a playboy.  It's been forever since I saw the first one and I don't remember any bad stuff -in fact I remember being surprised it was as good as it was- but like I said it's been awhile.  I wouldn't be sad if I'd spent a buck at redbox and then found out it was something I didn't want my kids watching all the time, but I feel like I wasted a good amazon vine pick this time around.  At least I can warn others before they spend their hard earned money on an inferior product.  If you're buying get Gnomeo and Juliet instead- cheesey but I loved it and the kids laughed plenty.
