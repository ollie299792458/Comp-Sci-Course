THE POINT OF VIEW REVIEW: POPCORN TIME with "American Gangster"

American Gangster. Fantastic.

The team that made this film has successfully delivered a wonderfully engrossing true story of two very fascinating men.

This is the amazing story of a genius of a crime boss named Frank Lucas (played by Denzel Washinton) and the cop who wouldn't let him go (played by Russell Crowe).

What is particularly impressive is that the American Gangster presents both the glamour and the grit of the life of crime, but somehow does it in such a way that neither side out weighs the other. It is simply one very complete story with excellent writing and great execution.

Is it violent? Yes, but not at all in a gratuitous manner. It's a gangster movie.

Is it long? Yes and no. Its two and a half hours long, but I only say that so you have the right amount of snacks to get you through. The film doesn't feel long, it's simply an interesting story that takes longer than average to tell.

This is a movie for those who love film, a good story, gangster movies, historically based dramas or just great entertainment.

Enjoy!
