Every TV show gets to a point where it just needs to stop and this is where Red Dwarf needed to stop. Series 7 is very very different to the previous 6, in some ways it's good and in alot more ways it's very bad. For starters Chris Barrie decided to leave which left a major gap in the cast and co-writer Rob Grant also decided to part ways with Doug Naylor and co. The whole look and feel of the show changed big time which left us with a show that was more like a comedy drama than a situation comedy. Chris Barrie was replaced with the paifully unfunny Chloe Annett as Listers long time love interest Kochanski and there was no live audience. All in all series 7 seriously lacked the comedy punch of the previos 6 and the lack of Rimmer left Lister with no one to bounch off. Kryten suddenly turned gay and the Cat just became more and more irratating as the season progressed. It's not all bad however there were some really good episodes in this season such as the excelent 'Tikka To Ride' and 'Ouroboros' one of the few without Chris Barrie that actually worked and 'Stoke Me A clipper' is lots of fun 'Blue' is worth watching just for the munchkin song at the end. The rest are mostly awful in particular 'Beyond A joke' witch i found to be embarrasing and the awsomely dull 'Duct Soup'. Overall the show on it's own is not up to much but the DVD extras are well worth the asking price.
