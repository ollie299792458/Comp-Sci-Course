I think that almost any novel (or series of novels) which achieves 'favorite' status is at a competitive disadvantage when turned into a film.  The most notable exceptions are works written, either consciously or not, with a screenplay in mind (I'm convinced Michael Crichton ONLY writes screenplays).

I think it safe to assume that C. S. Forester was not writing with the screen, either large or small, in mind so I have to say that this series is hands down the best miniseries ever produced from another media.

The series is well paced, the characters well developed and wonderfully cast, the action scenes excellently shot, but to my way of thinking the series best feature is the development and maturation of the character of Hornblower himself..

I've always been a fan of `coming of age' films (my all time favorite - A Bronx Tale), but to watch the growing relationships which Hornblower develops with Mathews, Styles, Captain Foster, Taping, and particularly with Captain/Admiral Sir Edward Pellew is truly a joy.

Ioan Gruffudd's portrayal produces a character which every guy should secretly want to be and which every woman should want to hook up with.  This series is a `must have' for every film library.
