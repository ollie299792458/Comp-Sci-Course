This review is confined mainly the the 3D effects,audio and video quality, and not to the movie itself.
Yes, the film will not appeal to many people due to its gory, bloody and disgusting nature. However, this blu ray edition is SIMPLY OUTSTANDING!!!
It appears that this movie was shot with the same 3D technology as that used for AVATAR. I don't know if this is true or not, but this movie simply pours out the best of 3D effects in every single bit! Almost every 5 min, something will pop out (truly, POP OUT!) of the screen, to satisfy your 3D cravings. In the scenes without 'pop-out' effects, the 3d is still brilliant. You can sense great depth in the frame. Try the opening scene in the stadium. You will literally feel the height, depth and layers of the stadium seats. The blu ray video quality is outstanding with breathtaking clarity and sharpness. Color saturation, contrast and overall quality of the HD transfer is nothing but best in every single scene.
Having owned many blu ray 3Ds, I can definitlety say that this blu ray 3D is THE Demo disc for your 3dtv system! This is almost equivalent to the Disney PIXAR Toy story 3 3D in terms of Full HD 3D presentation. Yeah, there is gore (and a lot of it), but if you are trying to see the limits of your 3D system, stop here. The audio is mind blowing, that can put you right in the middle of the scene. Simply brilliant by all means!
This disc includes the 2D version of the movie too, and for those who are wondering, this newer version of the blu ray is designed for today's 3D TVs. This blu ray does not have the red-blu 3D glasses. You can use it with your active (shutter) glasses (for those who have either Samsung or Sony). For one disc, the price is bit high (considering that you can get Disney's 4 disc sets in the same price range), but the 3D HD quality compensates for it.
