CROSSROADS, a movie about three teenage girlfriends who have drifted apart quite a bit throughout the four years in high school.  At the time of the movie the three girls, Lucy (Britney Spears), Mimi (Taryn Manning) and Kit (Zoe Saldana) meet back up at a special spot, and later begin a long journey across America.  On this trip they discover something that they used to know, but had lost track of...their amazing friendship.  This movie really is a good film about friendship and some of the most important things in life, that many take for granted.  Britney Spears, along with her co-starring girls and Anson Mount (Ben) do an incredible job of portraying young girls (and guy) learing their way to adulthood.  We all knew that Britney Spears could dance and sing extremely well, but did we know that she was such a great actress?  Well, if there were any doubts about the extent of this girls talent, it seems that it's endless.  Spears shows an extreme passion for acting and does it very well in the role of Lucy.  It would be great to see Spears acting even more in the future.  The movie also brings in some great appearances by Dan Aykroyd and Kim Cattrall, who play Lucy's parents, Pete and Caroline.  If ever in the mood for a fun, campy movie that's a little bit comedy and a little bit drama, turn to CROSSROADS and your multi-talented girl, Britney Spears.
