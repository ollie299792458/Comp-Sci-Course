Walter Huston, Ruth Chatterton, Mary Astor, Kathryn Marlowe, and John Payne headline this study of marriage and early 20th Century culture. The story line is solid, the script is restrained, direction &amp; acting  excellent. Typical of many lesser known films, Dodsworth combines the best  of book-to-film conversions (Sinclair Lewis-book, Sidney Howard-script),  and accurate psychological drama - for thinking adults. 
Dodsworth offers  a rare chance to see musical stage star Kathryn Marlowe as the daughter.  Marlowe (AKA Kay Kimber on Broadway &amp; London stage, Kay Rea on radio  and TV), was brought to Hollywood as Fred Astaire's choice to be his movie  partner at RKO studios. In typical Hollywood politics, this was stopped by  Ginger Roger's mother, an RKO executive. Marlowe is the person who  introduced Iowa radio sports announcer Ronald Reagan to Hollywood, getting  him his agent, and introducing him around. Underused as a Goldwyn personal  contract player, Marlowe returned to the London stage, starring in  "High Button Shoes". There, she also pushed careers of newcomers  in her shows, such as Audry Hepburn. Married to famed bandleader Roy Fox,  after World War II Marlowe stopped touring, and became Production Manager  of KTVO TV in Ottumwa, Iowa to be near her parents, and to raise a  family.
John Payne can be seen early in his busy career.
