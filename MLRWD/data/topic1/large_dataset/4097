Why has so little of Laurel and Hardy's work been released on DVD? The Marx Brothers, The Stooges, W.C. Fields, Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin -- all are well represented; Stan and Ollie are easily in their rank, but most of the DVD releases available seem to be shoddy public domain prints of their later, and least satisfying, films.
This release is a wonderful exception. Legend has done a smashing job restoring the original BABES IN TOYLAND; it's one of Stan and Ollie's best movies, and I have never seen it looking so good. While I normally loathe colorized movies, this is different for three reasons: first, Legend has included the complete, fully restored Black and White version for purists like me. Second, unlike other colorized classics like KING KONG, BABES IN TOYLAND does actually lend itself to color. And third, although it galls me to say it, Legend's coloring process is really quite amazing. It doesn't have a wish-washy, painted-over look about it. It actually looks appropriate. Kudos to them all around.
The extra features on the disk are another matter: some are fun, but there's quite a lot of public-domain junk that's been shoveled indiscriminately onto the disk. That's OK, though -- you're not buying this for the extra features; you'll look at them once and then treasure the main feature for years to come.
Of the several versions of BABES IN TOYLAND/MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS available on DVD, this is clearly the one to buy.
Now if only someone would release Laurel and Hardy's other early features and short subjects on DVD. . .
