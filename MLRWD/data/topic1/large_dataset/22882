That is exactly how you will feel after watching Cronenberg's latest, and surprisingly most accessible work.  Compared to other C. material, Spider is very simple in its plot but extremely complex in execution.  Notice the lack of eye contact and complete shame throughout the entire life of Spider after a significant event.  As a boy he can stare you straight in the face and call you a "murderer" but as an adult he has succumbed to muttering and hiding things in his pockets.
  Enough cannot be said of Fiennes and Richardson, both absolutely perfect in their roles.
  Anyone who follows Cronenberg knows it will not be an easy watch, and sometimes the reward is great ( Dead Ringers, Existenz,Videodrome, The Fly) and sometimes not as great as you hope ( M.Butterfly, Crash, Naked Lunch) but the viewing is always a pleasure.  The music, art direction, pacing and colors of a C. film are always impressive and worth traveling to see, each piece is a work of art, and Spider is definitely that.
  As with every C. exercise, don't try to make sense of Spider's history, we probably never saw the real history.  His mind is so preoccupied with schizophrenia that what the film lays out as an explaination may not really be, this may be frustrating for some, as it was in "Existenz" but here it is not. Because of the subject matter, just revel in the perfect acting and direction .
