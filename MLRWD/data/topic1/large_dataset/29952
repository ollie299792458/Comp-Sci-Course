I enjoy teen movies but often I find them to be rather cliche.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good of a film this turned out to be.  Both of the actors did a wonderful job portraying the characters.  This movie is about the interracial romance between a poor Hispanic kid and a white rich girl. Its also a tale of two opposite people being that Carlos is a hard-working student who travels far to the rich kid's school and Nicole is a rich slacker with little ambition in life.  She has many emotional problems due to her family and the death of her mother.
This is not a film that makes their romance easy.  There are problems on both sides being that they come from different worlds and have different ideas on life.  Nicole is a complicated character who makes you angry sometimes but you also see the pain she hides.  She falls for the grounded Carlos who in the end helps her to become a much better person. 
This film far surpasses the others out there.  The kids talk, dress and act real which makes it quite a bit more believable.  You care for these people when you watch this and hope things turn out for the best.  A great romance and film.  A+
