ARTISAN Entertainment's release of RAMBO: First Blood Part II should be the standard by which all DVD's are judged - excellent picture (with the exception of a few minor lines in a couple of scenes), great sound, plus a  veritable plethora of special features. For starters, RAMBO comes in a  "keep case," not one of those junky "snap cases" you get from Warner Bros.  The cover photo is printed right on the disc, a feature Disney is now  bragging about as if they invented the idea. The disc itself contains the  digitally mastered widescreen version of the film; a very interesting  commentary track with director George Cosmatos; vocally enhanced motion  menus; theatrical trailer; production notes; cast and crew info; a fun  trivia game; and to top it all off, the documentary, "An American Hero's  Journey!" What more could you ask for? As any good American knows, RAMBO is  the classic sequel to First Blood, and stars Sylvester Stallone as John  Rambo, Richard Crenna as Colonel Trautman, and Charles Napier as the  nefarious CIA Special Operations officer, Murdock. This time, the intrepid  "one man army" is sent on a mission to search for POW's in Vietnam. But  Murdock orders him not to engage the enemy, just take pictures. Of course,  Rambo is not satisfied to stop at photography; he means to bring his fellow  soldiers home -- at all costs. Abandoned by Murdock's men, Rambo fights a  war with both the Vietcong and the Russians all by himself - and very  effectively I might add! The ultimate action thriller, "RAMBO: First Blood  Part II" is a film no DVD collection should be without. A+
Note that  Rambo: First Blood Part II is rated R for lots of violence, gunplay, and  really COOL explosions!
