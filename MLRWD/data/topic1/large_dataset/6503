This is how an animated film is suppose to look like. I am a huge Disney fan and I love Winnie the Pooh, so of course I was excited when this film came out in theaters. What really turned me off was the fact that it was released the same day as "Harry Potter & the Deathly Hollows (Part 2)." Of course, I wanted to see both films, however, I wish Pooh was released a few days before Potter. It probably would have been recognized a bit more. Disney should have known Harry Potter was gonna outdo every other film at the box office. But, that doesn't matter now. I thought the animation was stunning, and Zooey Deschanel has the most beautiful singing voice. The DVD is pretty good. Glad Jim Cummings was back to voice both Pooh and Tigger. Bud Luckey (an animator at Pixar) voices Eeyore, and Tom Kenney (the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants) voices Rabbit. John Cleese (of Monty Python) was a perfect choice as the narrator because he sounds similar to Laurie Main (who was the narrator for "Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore"). Despite that the film was short, it was the best film of 2011 that I've seen. Yes, I liked it better than Harry Potter (and HP fanboys/fangirls, yell at me all you want)!

The DVD has some good bonus features like "The Ballad of Nessie" (a short film that proceeded "Winnie the Pooh" in theaters), a couple "Mini-Adventures" shorts where they basically dub over previous Pooh projects and shorten them, which I'm not really a fan of.

Now, all we need is a Blu-Ray release of "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh."
