If you're a traditional English mystery lover, I think there's a good chance you'll enjoy this movie more than many reviewers here or the critics in general did. I  certainly loved much of it and was less enthralled with only smaller bits. The puzzles genuinely intrigued me, and I was eager to figure them out. The cinamatography was gorgeous, and I was tranfixed by the stunning, one-shot sequences that lead up to each murder. They were visually and emotionally thrilling, the perfect fusion of plot and art. They relentlessly built tension and kept me at the edge of my seat, full of anticipation and looking for clues.

I also admired most of the acting, especially by the professor and the Russian student, and the overall English-mystery tenor of the characters and the film with some hyperbole and humor in their characterizations. The plot was intriguing with a good and unforeseeable twist at the end, the settings gorgeous, and some of the math and philosophy intriguing.

I didn't personally find the film as over-talky/lecturish as several reviewers suggest, though some of the math and concepts presented were at times simplistic and not nearly as sophisticated as the movie made out. I also found Elijah Wood's kissing and romancing quite unnatural-seeming, but that worked in ways since it made me wonder if his character might be gay and the women only faking their attraction for him for other motives.

All in all, I enjoyed the movie a great deal more than your average, formulaic Hollywood thriller, and I think aficionados of old-time mysteries might agree. Five stars for eighty percent of it, and three stars for the rest.
