If you enjoy documentaries, you will most likely enjoy this film.  I watched a good portion of this film in late last fall.  I enjoyed it so much that I decided to buy it.  However, I just recently got around to viewing it.  I don't know what took me so long because it was definitely worth the money and the two and a half hours of my time.

This film shows the far-reaching impact that the corporation has on the world.  It gives a broad scope but yet zooms in to give detailed views of the different impacts that the corporation has (most of it bad).  Michael Moore points to the fact that it's perfectly fine for corporations to do good, and they do, but the problem is that they care about the bottom line and everyone else bears the large cost in their pursuit of profit.

I can really get into films like this, and I found myself laughing out loud and engaged with this film and getting fired up, as two whistle blowers who worked for a large media corporation, refused to compromise their integrity at the cost of not reporting the truth about a very potentially harmful effect that a growth hormone used on dairy cows has on humans who drink their milk, not to mention the unnecessary pain and health complications it puts the cows through.

Yet tears put those flames out, as some parts made me angry, followed by sadness.  One part of the film shows just how far corporations will go; by attempts of one corporation to privatize water (in I believe) a Latin American country.  In wide protests, forces were called in to challenge the protesters, and a young man was shot and killed in the process.

Do yourself a favor and at least rent this film.
