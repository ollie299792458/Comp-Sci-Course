This DVD offers a black and white recording, filmed off a TV set, of the original 1957 television broadcast of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical 'Cinderella', starring a very young Julie Andrews. Given that the original tapes were lost, this is the only video material available from that legendary event in television and musical theatre history. The image and the sound are clear enough to allow for a pleasant watching experience. Until now, all I had from 'Cinderella' was an audio recording of the lovely Jon Cypher/Julie Andrews duet 'Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful'. To actually see them perform it on screen was totally captivating and a rare thrill. The musical itself is enjoyable, with fine performances all around and sufficient pace. The treatment of the Cinderella character is interesting: she is upbeat rather than dejected, and brings about the transformations that allow her to go to the ball by the sheer strength of her wishes, overcoming the reserves of her rather mischievous fairy godmother. 'In my own little corner' and 'Impossible' are two more fine songs. I watched 'Cinderella' with my 8 year old daughter, and she loved it.
