The secret code between the conspirators is the Preakness horse-race - except it shows as being scheduled for a Sunday (it's always run on a Saturday) and the 2010 Preakness is just a week away. I didn't have a chance to view the DVD until just yesterday.

As usual in Hollywood, there are similar gaffs - the right side collar insignia on Kirk Douglas's shirt in upside-down. In the military, hats are never worn indoors (unless the individual is on duty and carrying a sidearm or rifle, e.g. Military Police.) Navy and Coast Guard personnel wear hats while aboard a vessel. These were Air Force, Marine Corps, and Army Officers and they wore their hats indoors - even in the White House - major military etiquette faux pas and reflected poorly on the authenticity of the movie, in that respect it was just like when General Scott (Lancaster) was caught by Douglas in an un-necessary lie.

In the United States, the military is controlled by the civilian government - all of the cabinet Secretaries are civilians and appointed by the President. The military budget is tightly controlled so that secret base couldn't have been created. Only the CIA budget is above scrutiny - there are funds for some special purposes for which accountability is not required - and there is no reason to think that the CIA is about to change the status-quo. The American people don't need to fear the military as there will never be a military coup in the United States.

It just shows that Hollywood can sometimes very much be a loose cannon on a rolling deck. Attention to detail is important in all phases of creative endeavors - and motion pictures are a modern art-form. The "view of the forest" was obscured because "the trees" got in the way.
