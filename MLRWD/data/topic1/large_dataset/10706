This liberal family is pathetic, the leader (the man) of this family is pathetic.

The conclusions reached by this family are just as sad and wrong as the conclusions that got them where they were in the first place.

There is no such thing as "Being Gay", sure their are serious problems with getting our wires crossed as children and having life long struggles with inordinate sexual attraction but we cant spin 180 deg. and call it "being" anything.

Food for thought: 3% of the American population is counter-natural in regards their sexuality....Why do 75% of the movies Hollywood puts out retain this desensitizing propaganda of homo-sexual relationships, is it a desperate attempt to turn something repulsive into something "normal"?

I rated at 2 stars instead of 1, simply for the resiliency and unheard-of intestinal fortitude of the wife in this sad scene, in her act of love toward her father and bearing under the unimaginable strain of her bitterly cynical father, in doing so she gave us a glimmer of hope into what is becoming an increasingly dark and lost movie making world.

Truly the modern liberal family is dreadful and lonely place to be brought up in.
