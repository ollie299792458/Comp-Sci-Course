Despite some tinkering with the storyline, this is the best-ever film adaptation of Dickens's classic tale about a hard-hearted old miser who rediscovers his capacity for love and kindness one Christmas Eve when ghosts force him to re-examine his life. 
The poignant ghost of Christmas past dredges up Scrooge's memories, good and bad, reminding him of his early idealism and the bad choices that destroyed it. The jolly ghost of Christmas present shows Scrooge a vision of joy and abundance and the goodwill in most people's hearts--and ends with a chilling reminder of need in the midst of plenty. The terrifying ghost of Christmas yet to come forces Scrooge to confront his own mortality and to see the meaninglessness of his selfish life in the starkest possible terms. Sobbing with penitence, Scrooge vows to change his ways, and when he awakens on Christmas morning his joy produces film's most delirious fit of glee.
The film is perfectly true to the spirit and even the language of the original book, and drives its moral home with powerful, unforgettable performances. Alistair Sim is magnificent as Scrooge.
