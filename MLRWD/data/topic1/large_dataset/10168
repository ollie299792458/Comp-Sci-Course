This movie has to be one of the best football movies ever made. While watching this movie I was actually cheering out loud for the high school team. Denzel does such a convincing job as the head coach; sometimes you wonder if you are really watching Denzel or the original coach! Also the defensive coordinator is excellent. It was His team before Denzel came along, but they gave the team to Denzel hoping he would fail. Another, "We can't fail" movies, but it is done so well. The story is also very good. This is about a high school football team that needs to start having blacks and whites on the same team. This is the only school in the conference that is doing this right now. You can see that even though this story takes place in 1971, there are still a lot of stupid, ignorant people around that wanted to keep everything separate. If you don't find this movie entertaining and uplifting, then I would like to know a movie that is better. This movie goes in the same category as Rocky and Karate Kid. If you liked either of these movies, you will really like Remember the Titans.
