The figure of horrifically wounded soldier Joe Bonham literally haunted my nightmares after just seeing the clips from this film in Metallica's "One" video when I was younger.  I have since been moved and quite changed by seeing the full film, reading Trumbo's novel (several times), and experiencing the little-known stage adaptation by Bradley Rand Smith.  Trumbo's novel is required reading for anyone interested in war literature.  There is no story like the story of Joe Bonham, a boy who has, as literally as one can state it, lost everything by blindly participating in a war he never understood.  The film, book, and play are staunchly anti-war and may come across overly didactic (even unneccessarily so) at times, but the subject of these great pieces of art is Joe himself.  It is ultimately a story about life, about how far the human spirit can be pushed and about the absolutely senseless reasons we destroy ourselves and each other.  For me, the film is a little messy, in comparison to the book and play, but all three together really get the point across.  If you're interested in learning more about the play (which Amazon doesn't carry - and should!), check out the website I've included.  It's always being produced somewhere it seems, especially in NYC.  And if enough of us ask for it, I bet we can get the film on DVD sometime soon!
