The reason people are rating this so low is because "It's only one episode!"

See, that's not entirely true. If you would have read all the information about the DVD, you would know that it has "bonus features".

From Amazon:
"Disc 1:
Partial Terms of Endearment
Special Features:
The Seth and Alex Almost Live Comedy Show
Family Guy: Live and Uncensored Table Read
Animatic for Partial Terms of Endearment
9 Original Songs Composed for Family Guy"

If you ask me, all that is worth 10$. And if you don't think it is, just wait for the price to be cut down. I bet within a few months you'll be able to buy it for half the price.

Also- think about this. They couldn't include this DVD in the box set because it is too controversial. This way, people know what they're buying beforehand. Honestly I think putting this on the box set would have been a mistake, it would have created a string of complaints. I still can't believe they didn't just delete the whole episode where Stewie eats horse sperm from Vol. 8 (the most complained about TV clip ever). I think we're lucky to get this episode at all.
