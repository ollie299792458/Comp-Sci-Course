This was one of the first movies I saw on my first duty assignment in the USAF at Ramstein Air Base, West Germany (as it was in 1983).  The cold war was real, the Iron Curtain was real and intact, and the Fulda Gap separated the free West from the communist East.  Ok, the special effects are nothing like they are today, but back then, they weren't too bad.  Back then, there were fears that the Soviets would come up with a better plane than we had so the story is logical.  In the present, I have used parts of this film and others like Moscow on the Hudson <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005QCTY">Moscow on the Hudson</a> to show my young son how life was in a communist country (since so many on the left these days think the US should turn from a Republic to Socialist nanny state).  This movie still brings back memories of my early days out on the rim of freedom, staring at the guns of our potential enemies.  Yeah, some parts of it are corny (really? melt a smooth runway on the icepack in only 5-minutes?) and the climax wasn't what I thought it should be, but overall, I do enjoy watching this movie.
