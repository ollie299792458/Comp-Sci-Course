I don't want to like this film. Really, I don't.

It's offensive and vulgar (don't let your kids see it, please). It features a 15-year-old girl who researches her book on sex by sleeping with a variety of men between 14 and 30 years old and videotaping the sessions. The Easter Bunny gets beaten up. And when Willem (Ethan Suplee) can't see the sailboat in the Magic Eye picture, he's mean to little children (a lot of the film seems to be mean to little children).

But there's something about Kevin Smith's films that I enjoy - it's certainly not the constant swearing, but it could be the adorable Jason Lee, or the ever-present Jay & Silent Bob.

Mallrats is about a couple of college-age slackers who get dumped by their girlfriends on the same day and visit the mall to cheer themselves up.

TS (Jeremy London) is the quiet one, brooding over his love, while Brodie (Lee) is the not-at-all quiet one, obsessing over comic books and video games and ranting about everything he sees.

London is nice but dull, while Lee makes the movie. This was his first major film role, and he's just hilarious. And he somehow makes his insensitive, argumentative character quite likeable.

Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith himself) are a lot of fun, as always, as they save the day for TS & Brodie and help them get their girlfriends back.

The movie doesn't really make any sense - there are many holes in the logic. But that's okay, it's not meant to be logical.

I really did hate the offensive parts (I can't watch when they beat up the Easter Bunny in front of little kids!). But, like I said, I couldn't help but enjoy the movie despite myself.

If you're not familiar with the movie, you may want to rent it before buying it. Unless you're already a Kevin Smith fan, in which case, you've probably already seen the movie a million times anyway. ;-)
