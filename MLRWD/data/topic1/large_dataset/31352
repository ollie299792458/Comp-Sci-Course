I got a copy of HBO's movie "Recount" and I hadn't worked up enough emotional internal fortitude (I knew it was gonna make me very, very vexed) until now. and sure enough, I *AM* vexed!

The recap of the recount is even more despicable now, with the benefit of panoramic vision and hindsight, than it was then. Unlike the "victors" of the subject election, the made for HBO movie, interwoven with actual News footage, legitimately wins its Emmy as Outstanding Made-for-TV Movie. Laura Dern deserved an Emmy, and the Golden Globe voters gave her their vote, for her spot-on performance as the preeningly vapid, vampy Katherine Harris, Florida Secretary of State, "Good Soldier" in the Bush Army. Repulsive Republican dirty tricks abound. and watch Joe Lieberman who was, even then as Gore's running mate(!) working to serve himself (potential 2004 run) and the Republicans.

Watch the movie (again, if you've seen it before)  - it'll fire you up!!  Remember what Santayana said:Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.  /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer
