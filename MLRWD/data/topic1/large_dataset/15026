"Renaissance" is so stylishly done and so startling visually that one finds one's self hooked from the opening moment. Unfortunately, because of this the failings of the storyline itself make the let-down that much more painful when it comes.

Do not get me wrong -- I enjoyed this movie. I am glad I own the DVD. But I still cannot help feeling that when the big secret is revealed -- that the kidnapped scientist has discovered the secret to immortality -- to have the sympathetic protagonist cry out: "she is dangerous! Don't you see, without death life will have no meaning!" ...well, perhaps it is because I am old enough to have a sense of my own mortality that this line of reasoning makes no impact upon me. If the film is supposed to persuade me that NOT DYING is a bad thing, then it will need to make a stronger argument in order to succeed.

So, if you are seeking a futuristic adventure with a plot driven by an intellectually justifiable idea, then this is not the movie for you. However, if you have never quite shaken off your sense of awe at the cityscape of near-future Los Angeles as imagined in "Blade Runner" then the harsh black-and-white near-future Paris of "Renaissance", with its fluid point-of-view magnifying the viewer's overall sense of disorientation, will not disappoint you.
