I would like to restrict my comments to the film itself and not to the quality of the DVD. The mixed reviews on this film left me puzzled after I first saw it. I feel this is a very complex film and people do not like things that they don't understand. It is open to several interpretations. The whole film has a dreamlike quality to it. Is what happened at the party a reality or just imagination? Was Nicole Kidman's appearance at the party just a coincidence? There are many questions and few answers. But after all isn't that what makes a film fun?, something that makes you wonder, makes you think. Everyone now wants in your face entertainment. No one wants to search for answers. I find this type of entertainment stimulating. This is a film that is typical Kubrick, long range shots, lots of color and rich in vivid imagery. This is a fine end to one of the great film careers that any producer, director has ever had. Even though Kubrick's output was not by any means huge, he has left us with a rich and wonderful film legacy.
