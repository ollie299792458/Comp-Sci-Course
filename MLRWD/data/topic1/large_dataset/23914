This is one of the most incredible DVDs that I have ever bought in my entire life. I was amazed by the journey of two men. One is a christian and the other is not a christian. As a believer myself I already believe and know that the bible is inspired by God (2 Timothy 3:16).  As the two men documented their journey I was excited by each new discovery. I've shown this video to 3 Christians so far and they were encouraged by the detail and accuracy take from scripture. For someone what is skeptical I would recommend that they would purchase this DVD with an open mind. The whole point of Mt. Sinai is where Moses received the 10 commandments fo Gods law. The first four commandments represent loving God with all our heart, soul mind and strength and the last 6 commandments represent loving our neighbors as ourselves.  Ofcourse today when we examine ourselves by looking at the 10 commandments we discover that we are guilty of breaking them. Who hasn't told a lie? In Revelations 21:8 we are told that all liars will have their part in the lake of fire. The 10 commandments cannot save us. It is just a mirror to show us that we are seperated by God because of sin. Because God is Holy, Righteous and Just, He must punish sin with eternal punishment in a place called hell. But God did something incredible for those who repent & believe in Jesus Christ because Jesus came to earth and lived a sinless life and then died on the cross for our sins, paying the penalty that all of us deserve. Are you broken over your sin? Are you shattered over your sinfulness? Jesus said, "Blessed is the poor in Spirit"  After Jesus died, He rose from the grave, defeating death. You can sum it up like this. We broke the law but Jesus paid the fine. Jesus said, "Unless you repent, you will perish" This is God-given (John 6:44) Repent & believe and then get baptized as a sign of obedience toward God and the read your bible and obey the Lord & Master of your life, Jesus Christ.  Amen.
