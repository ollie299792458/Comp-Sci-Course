first off I must address one thing people seem to forget when talking about this story.

I have noticed that a lot of people complain that the phantom is not the same as he was in the first musical and that this is a form of character assassination.

well it's not! for one simple reason. it takes place 10 YEARS LATER! think about it, are you the exact same person in the exact same state of mind as you were 10 years ago? of course not! in those 10 years circumstances have occurred that caused you to grow, change, mature evolve! (whatever word you want to use!)

Anyway that aside. This is an absolutely gorgeous production! the score is both uplifting in some areas and haunting in others! my personal favorites are Christine's gorgeous aria, Love never dies (performed by the extraordinary Anna O'Byrne)and the beautiful yet longing Till I hear you sing by Ben Lewis who gives such an impressive performance as the Phantom. my final favorite is the rockish number the Beauty Underneath. yes it seems a tad out of place until you consider that it does work if you consider it a parallel to the duet Phantom of the Opera from the predecessor. (both songs are duets where the Phantom attempts to see if the other in question is receptive.)

the costumes are fascinating as well. but the standout is Christine's opera gown. I really enjoyed the detail in Christine's sapphire necklace and her peacock motif!

All in all this is a very enjoyable recording which captures much that is easy to miss in a live performance!
