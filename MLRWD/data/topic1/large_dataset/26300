I just got done reading a review for this that wrote that Anais Nin was spoilt and immature and lacked feelings. All she ever did was give!! I love Henry Miller's writing to death but any self-repsecting artist will tell you that Henry lacked emotion and had an insatiable lust for whores. Henry was a wonderfull author, yes, but the reason why his writing so wonderfull was because he gave the part of his "self" that he could not act out in reality to his work. Because henry was a man of pieces. The little emotion and love and happiness he did have was reserved for the books he wrote and the ones closest to him. The reason why this movie is told from Anais Nin's point of view is because she's the one who gave personal insight into Henry and June through her journals in the first place... Don't listen to the idiot who wrote the last review about how Henry had passion and emotion. They don't understand art and obviously know nothing of Anais Nin because of they didn't know why the movie was from her perspective. This movie is more or less correct but what I wrote above is just a rant about what really happened. That damned person who wrote that review probablly only read Henry Miller and Anais Nin in college where they made him/her read it and he/she probablly didn't undertsand half of it.
