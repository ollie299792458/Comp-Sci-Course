This movie kicks ass. Glover is a genius (but everyone knows this already). And the scene with the little dog is just lovely. My neighbors had a dog like that (used to drive me crazy), though after I saw the movie, they moved (funny coincidence). His emotions were so on with that part. Sad to say, that's exactly what I would have done and thought. But really. This is the movie that brought me out of my sleep and initiated me into the wonder of Crispin Hellion Glover. And the rats.. the rats.. 
Reminded me a tad of the Lovecraft story "Rats in the Walls", which is very cool. I wish I had magic powers to control rats like that. Also, this movie has wonderful atmosphere and the mother is freaky. Glover got a nomination for this, I believe. This is such a unique movie and part, especially for a talent such as he. Only thing is the director seemed a little overobsessed with Psycho, which is both cool and disturbing. Also, I wish they had just kept it rated R and shown all. Nothing should be censored. It does have the feel of an older movie from that era though (Hitchcock, Psycho, etc). Something I especially enjoyed about it.
Oh, and the tearing of the newspaper. Nice. "Tear it up.. tear it up".. =) I also like the sound of the ice cream truck in the background after mummy dies and the clock and forshadowing of Ben's foot. That little sequence was especially nice. The last scene is great too. I think it was better that way and I agree with Crispin that they all live on somehow. Lovely, lovely movie.
