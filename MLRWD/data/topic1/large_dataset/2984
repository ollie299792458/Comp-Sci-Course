I am a HUGE Austen, Bronte, etc. fan and watch every adaptation I can get my hands on.  When this came out it piqued my interest.  I didn't know the story beyond the synopsis and didn't recognize anyone in the film so I was nervous about the purchase. It had been a while since anything new like this had been released and I was craving a period romance so I went ahead and purchased it.  Whenever I think of it I triumph at the purchase because it turned out to be such an overwhelmingly satisfying experience.  I sob every time I watch this movie.  Not cry, I sob!  I actually laugh at myself whenever I put the disc in the player because I can't believe I'm going to put myself through the exhausting emotions it creates...but I can't help it, I love this movie!!! The passion between the lead characters is palpable and proof of their chemistry because their intimate moments are stolen and chaste.  (It's PG and a true PG.  Nothing to be worried about if someone happens upon you while viewing it!)  Aside from the ultimate tragedy in the movie, the next greatest is that the desperate situation Keats faces in his work were hindered by the social mores of the time period.  The knowledge that had they lived a few generations later, life would have been dramatically different for them.  For those of you that want the lavish visuals of the sets costumes and scenery that the time period require, you will not be disappointed there either.  It is a tragedy to be sure but don't pass this one over.  It's just too good to miss.
