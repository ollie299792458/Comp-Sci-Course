As many were, I too was skeptical of how well this set would turn out and after just having finished watching all 10 hours I am pleasantly and enthusiastically astonished! I still can't believe what a wonderful job they did putting this concert together on DVD.

The audio is great in 2.0 stereo and in 5.1 and DTS it will blow you away. Instead of having chapter listings they have each DVD's list of performers for easy searching for your favorite and start at the beginning of that act. But the chapters are setup so you can skip individual songs. The Video is 16:9 and excellent and many things were cleaned up from the original broadcast feeds. As for the performances, if you saw it on TV, you already know how good it was and if you didn't you will not be disappointed.

I'm buying one for everyone on my holiday shopping list that I know will enjoy these concerts. As for my comment on the value of this set, where in this day and age can you get great entertainment for only three dollars and hour? Do yourself a favor and get this set and Enjoy!
