The scenes I thought were the funniest in this movie were the one where Norbit and Rasputia get together in bed and when Rasputia gets "on top" of him the break breaks and falls down to the floor (that was a little insulting to fat people, but I thought it was a hoot). Also the second funniest scene was where Rasputia goes down the waterslide, creates a mini tsunami, and splahes almost everyone in the park.

In the movie most of the audience is cheering for Norbit (Eddie Murphy) to get together with Kate (Thandie Newton) and leave him big angry overgrown wife Rasputia who is a domineering negative force in Norbit's life. You have to see the movie to see if Norbit is man enough to leave Rasputia without getting crushed and beaten up.

I had a hard time getting my mind around how Eddie Murphy could play 3 completely different characters (Mr. Wong, Norbit, and the obese Rasputia). The movie industry must have some really cool tricks into making movies like this. Overall the movie was very funny, but I don't think I will watch it again. There is quite a bit of crude humor in the movie.
