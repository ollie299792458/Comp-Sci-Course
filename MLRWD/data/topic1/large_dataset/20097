First things first: It's the Devil's son that is coming back in this movie, not the Devil himself, Mr. Vampire.

Second: I'm not going to waste time repeating what the movie was about, thats what the back cover is for

Third: Comic book movies, although not tying very often to the original story line of the books, have been rising in popularity, and I have personally been impressed. Of course that monstrosity Hulk followed by th BIG LETDOWN Punisher almost completely murdered my interest in comic movies forever, until Neo came back from the dead to vanquish demons. I'll be the first to admit, KEANU REEVES IS THE SAME PERSONALITY IN EVERY!!! MOVIE HE'S IN. That aside, he finally matched his personality to the perfect typewritten character (John Constantine). It suit's him well, now all we need is for Mr. Smith to come back in the sequel and this will be my all time favorite series.

Fourth: The only thing I regreted about this film is the inexcusable BOY MEETS WORLD, he's livable in the opening scene but after that he just gets in the way.
