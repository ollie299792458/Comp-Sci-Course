A fantastic, cream of the crop, murder/mystery thriller, which combines the outstanding acting talents of Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint, the brilliant, script, written by Ernest Lehman, and the excellent directorial skills of Alfred Hitchcock into a classic, one of a kind movie, that has never again been duplicated by Hollywood.

In addition to the movie, the special features, in this, 50th Anniversary, 2-Disc, DVD set, contains: 1.)a notable, profile of Cary Grant, 2.)a behind the scenes tour, of the making of the movie, narrated by Eva Marie Saint, which includes interviews with: Hitchcock's daughter, Pat Hitchcock, writer, Ernest Lehman, and actor, Martin Landau, 3.)a critique and analysis of the movie by several film directors: Curtis Hanson(LA Confidential), Francis Lawrence(I Am Legend), Guillermo del Toro(Pan's Labyrinth), Christopher McQuarrie(The Usual Suspects), and William Friedkin(The Exorcist), 4.)a gallery of movie stills, and 5.)a really, cool, documentary, which examines Alfred Hitchcock's ingenious, ability to captivate an audience for the sole purpose of presenting a visually, engrossing, story, on-screen,(not to gross out the audience with endless scenes of blood and gore that is so common in many of today's superficially made films), to crown him, Master of Suspense!
