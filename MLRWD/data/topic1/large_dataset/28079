.....a movie that went straight to video and had almost no promotions would gather such a following by hearsay alone.  But such is the case with Boondock Saints, the debut film by writer/director Troy Duffy.  I happened upon this movie by mere chance when a friend at work rented it and let me borrow it.  "Look I know you've never heard of this but just watch it.  For God's sake, watch it."  So I took it home and watched it.  Called another friend, told him to come over....then I watched it again.  Later I started to search for this on video.  Unfortunately, it wasn't available!  Anyone who had a VHS copy owned a pre-viewed rental copy.  EVENTUALLY it became available on DVD in all its glory.  The commentary by Duffy is hilarious and the optional subtitle can sometimes come in handy during some of the 'more incoherent' Irish dialogues.  The characters are VERY Irish and their accents are thick but I'd have it no other way.

I love how protective some of these reviewers are.  Someone said that he actually hurts inside when someone says they don't like this movie.  Right on.  There are plenty of true fans out there that will always be around to proclaim this film as a masterpiece.  Years from now, future generations will carry the legacy and pass it on to our decendents.  It makes me so happy *tear*.

Keep an eye out for 'All Saints Day'.....the Boondock Saints sequel!  Check the official website for details.
