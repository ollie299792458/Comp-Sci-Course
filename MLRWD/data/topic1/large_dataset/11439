I first borrowed the "Dinotopia" DVD from the library, and it was much longer than I thought it would be. It starts off a bit sudden - the scene where a father and his two sons, Karl and David, are plane-wrecked in the middle of the sea happens in less than 2 minutes. The father supposedly drowns, and the two boys arrive at Dinotopia. They don't show much emotion towards the fact that their father may be dead. The first time they see a real, live dinosaur, all the expression they can muster is, "Wow, a dinosaur." The two meet a nice girl living in Dinotopia named Marion, who lives by the Dinotopian law of peace and unity. Later on, a mad professor tries to kill a saurian (dinosaur), and the dim-witted mayor charges Karl and David instead for a minor crime. There are large gaps and holes to the story, such as why the sunstones underground have not failed while the ones on top have, and how David and Karl's father survived in that cave the whole entire time. The question is not answered how they will be able to get home, but it is suggested that they would stay forever in Dinotopia, forever leaving behind their past life.

Though lacking main points and a clear storyline, the visual effects are amazing at times. For example, Zippo Stenosaurus, the librarian dinosaur, is realistic and is a memorable character. The scenery and background are all stunning, much like the ones in "Star Wars." Though the acting is not the best, it gets better towards the end. Overall, I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would, and I highly recommend it to children and adults.
