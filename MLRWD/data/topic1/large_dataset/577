I was seriously dissapointed when this movie wasn't released near me. After watching today and absorbing the gorgeous cinematography, it's even more frustrating I couldn't have enjoyed this on the big screen. Well, the small screen here in my living room left me aching for more visually, but in terms of substance of the plot, it more than made up for it.

I had a general idea of the plot before viewing, but this movie played on so many different levels. It may appear on the surface to be a suspenseful hunting movie, and there certainly is a build-up of suspense as it progresses, but it's main theme is really about the small cast of characters and the influences they all have on each other. It is a rather slow moving story that builds character development throughout, but it held my attention completely. Plus, it builds tension slowly through character conflict as well as through the raw power of nature. It didn't hurt that Defoe was absolutely perfect in this part. He has that rare ability to act non-verbally that speaks volumes and transfixes the viewer. The rest of the cast does a great job, and the two child actors give realistic performances...you believe them completely in their roles.

I won't get into the plot as I wouldn't want to spoil any aspect of this film for others. I will say though that the last 15 minutes or so moved me on a deeply emotional level. It wasn't predictable in my opinion. So, I would certainly highly recommend this to others, but just be ready for a film dealing with realism, not Hollywood flash.
