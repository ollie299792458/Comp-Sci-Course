This is absoulutely one of the best Trek films you'll ever see.  What really boggles me is how many people have labeled this film a very terrible one.  While the film does not give the eye candy that some people may  crave, it gives Trek fans everything else that they could want.
For  example, the plot of the film, while a bit far-fetched, still holds true to  the ideals Star Trek has to offer.  Sybok, a emotional vulcan has taken  upon himself to find God.  But he needs a Starship to reach him, so he  kidnaps three civilians of Nimbus III and sends a message to the worlds  each civilians are from.  From Starfleet comes Jame T. Kirk and the  Starship Enterprise to save the day.  There you have it, the basic  plotline.  What I like about this setup is that it rids Trek of the  constant plots centering around the destruction of a planet and focuses on  the exploration of not only space, but of the human mind and its pain. It  also questions life itself.  i.e. Is it really just a dream? The end result  is it is a much more deep plot than that of Insurrection. 
Character  development is also a plus in this film.  Just about all the characters  changed in some way throughout the course of it.  Much attention was given  to the relationship of friendship and family that Kirk, Spock, and Mccoy  share and we see Sybok go through the change of being much more complex  than first impressions show.
All and all Trek and non-Trek fans should  enjoy this Movie despite it's less than great special effects.  My advice  is to sit back, enjoy and not nitpick.  Movies are just movies, they are  not life.  If you need to escape the reality of life for a few hours, I  highly recommend you experience this installment in the enjoyable Trek  series.
