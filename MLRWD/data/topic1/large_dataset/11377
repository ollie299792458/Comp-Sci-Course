I'm a big fan of the original film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MYIXAC">Let The Right One In</a> and I've got to admit I watched this expecting not to like it. Despite that, I was pleasantly surprised!

Matt Reeves re-make keeps closely to the Swedish film apart from some obvious changes like moving the action to New Mexico. The story - a sort of pre-teen horror romance - is really touching and will appeal to anyone who felt like a misfit at school and/or wanted that special friend when they were growing up. The acting is superb, especially from the two young leads with Chloe Moretz (who you might recognise as the little sister from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UV4XUG">(500) Days of Summer</a>) particularly strong. She really captures something ancient, youthful, magical yet terrifying.

Having said all that I didn't find it as good as the original. There's more horror and less subtlety. In fact several aspects which are handled very delicately in the Swedish version - the 80s setting, the paedophilic angle - are spelt out here. I guess it shows the difference between American and European film-making. And thank heavens they kept out the scene where Abby becomes a vampire! It's seriously misjudged - though you can check it out in the DVD 'Special Features'.

If you've seen the original version this is definitely worth watching. If you haven't, and don't mind subtitles, watch that one first.
