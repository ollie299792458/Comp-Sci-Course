I so wanted to see this one in the theaters but missed it.  I rented it when it came out and bought it before I returned the rental dvd.  I thought it was very very funny and has the most unique scene of someone nearly preventing their own conception!

The part of it that I take exception to is this:  I am part of the generation that is shown going back in time.  I was 21 in 1986.  Not everyone in my generation (or any others) did the drugs and stuff that they show.  They give the impression that everybody did drugs then but we didn't all do them.  I stayed away from them and haven't ever touched them.  Normally I dis any movie that glorifies drug use but in this case I made an exception.

Ignore the drug use (not all of us did that) and enjoy seeing of all people, Chevy Chase being called an old man!  I just don't have that mental image of him as an "old man" sort of like I can't imagine Clint Eastwood being called an old man by anyone who wants to live to see tomorrow!
