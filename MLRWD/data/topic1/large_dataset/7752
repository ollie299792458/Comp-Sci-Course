An excellent movie with an interesting way of presenting a story.  This is not a typical WWII movie.  This is Hart's War and so the entire movie is told from Hart's point of view.  This is subjective storytelling.  The viewer -- especially one who has watched various prison escape movies - will not be surprised by what Hart discovers at the end of the movie.  That's OK, because we aren't supposed to be surprised; the point is that Hart is surprised.  What will Hart do with his knowledge? Col. McNamara (Bruce Willis) is a puzzle -- is he a good guy or a bad guy? We are seeing McNamara through Hart's eyes, and Hart, with his inexperience in life and war, cannot understand or comprehend McNamara. Hart misses some things and misreads others because of his own fears and ignorance.  Hart's "war" is not just WWII, or his "war" in surviving the prison camp or dealing with other prisoners.  It's the war he is having with himself, in trying to determine what is the right thing to do.  It's also about Hart learning that sometimes there is no "right" thing possible -- there are no easy answers.
