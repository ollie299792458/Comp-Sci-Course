I watched this movie in 3d with my lady.  This movie will just WOW your eyes.  I am a movie buff, and this was the most stunning visuals i have ever seen.  The owls are freaking gorgeous...lol...while watching this movie i thought to myself i actually wanted that white owl:0  The 2d version is great also.  A friend came over and the kids were watching the dvd on their 37 inch hd tv...my friend was like WHAT IS THAT! lol. he couldn't stop looking at it(no joke it was that gorgeous).  Had he seen it in 3d on my panny, he'd have tripped for real.  If you want to get the most out your tv's visual's...this is a must buy.  The 3d was better than Tangled 3d(which i still love) Step Up 3d(which is cool) and Tron 3d can't even come close...

The trees, water, flying and fighting of the owls, the shiny feathers of the owls...everything about this movie...ridiculous in detail.  GET THIS MOVIE!!!  I know my review is saying the same thing...but i mean...you just got to see it to know what I mean.  I have a panny gt25 3d tv also if that helps anyone out there looking to buy this movie.  The greatest thing about this movie is that the story keeps you interested.  Its not a movie where you buy only for the 3d.  You will actually watch this movie...the 3d and beauty will just AMAZE you and the story is quite suspenseful.  Also, I treat my 3d movies like a movie theater...meaning I wait til its nighttime, turn off the lights and enjoy.
