The lighting technician single-handedly destroyed this DVD.  With the exception of the faces, everything is immersed in hellish blue.  He (she) got paid regardless of performance, and obviously did not give a damn.  He needs to find another line of work.  It is disgustingly unfair to the performers who did their best.  Why did the director put up with it?  This was 2009.  Technology has open the door to visions from an earlier era.  With an imaginative director, this could have been an excellent DVD.  This shortcoming never should have been allowed to happen.

The role of Arturo fits Juan Diego Flores like a glove, especially vocally.  Nino Machaidze is a convincing Elvira, and has great chemistry with JDF.  The JDF-Machaidze third act is unforgetable.  Nino is one to watch in the future.  Besides her voice, she is beautiful and is a superb actress.  This DVD is ruined by the bulb technician and/or the director.  It is inexcusable to deliver such shoddy product in the 21st century.  The lighting/video is no match to the Met version with Anna Netrebko.  The difference has more to do with professional pride than budget.
