My partner and I just finished watching the last 30 minutes of this horrible movie in FFW.  We enjoyed the first 30/45 minutes as much as watching a made for TV movie.  There are very few gay movies that are really worth watching, that when you come across something this mediocre you decide to sit back and try to enjoy the remaining minutes in the hopes that the writing and acting will improve.  After the big break-up, however, this one just fell apart.  It seemed that the writer and director did not know what they were trying to accomplish:  was this a tender love story or a pilot for a wild and crazy sitcom told in very broad brush strokes?  Unfortunately, it turned out to be the latter.  And of course they had to tack on the requisite predictable ending.  Are gay men (and other fans of gay movies) this desperate that drivle like this has to be tolerated?  I think there are much better movies worth spending your time on.  Don't even bother renting, much less buying, this mistake.  And please, don't even try comparing this to Thelma and Louise.
