Having received one copy of this video, I was quite surprised to receive a second copy when after ordering some books.  It seems that, when I ordered the books, my Amazon "shopping cart" AUTOMATICALLY included the Chaplin set of videos in my "shopping cart" even though I did not want or order the video set again.  Although I saw the Chaplin set in the "cart" I assumed it was simply there as a record of what I had PREVIOUSLY ordered and ALREADY RECEIVED.  As it turned out, my assumption was wrong, and since the Chaplin video set is from "overseas," it is not returnable.  I view this as a deceptive  and exploitative marketing initiative, and it WILL discourage me from ording from Amazon in the future.  Amazon benefitted in the short run by selling another copy of the video, and will suffer in the long run as a result of my displeasure and distrust of the Company's selling policies.

Not, mind you, that I think any of this will really matter to Amazon.  I'm writing the review simply to express my feelings.
