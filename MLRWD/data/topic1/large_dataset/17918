Of course the film can't capture all the elements of the book that made it so much fun, but that's true with just about every book-to-movie adaptations. The tales from book are all tailored in to one event to make this movie flow which I didn't mind at all, instead of watching a bunch of short stories. This movie is about Tucker and his friend's adventure to celebrate a bachelor party with a hidden agenda. The dialect of this film was hilarious to me, I was crying laughing and on the verge of peeing my pants. There are very funny one liners though out. Regardless if you're offended by him or you support him, believe the stories or not... you have to admit, Tucker Max has a talent to tell a story. I originally rented a digital copy of this movie from amazon.com. Because I love the book and enjoy his website, www.tuckermax.com, and had a great time with the movie, I will also purchase this DVD to share watch with my friends. The only reason I didn't give this movie a 5 star is because there's not a Blu-ray version.
