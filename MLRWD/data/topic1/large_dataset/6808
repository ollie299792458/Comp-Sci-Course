This was probably the 2cnd best of the series, behind Part 2. One of the problems I have with this series is more philosophical. In this era of the surviving "Super serial killer", this movie more than any other makes a hero out of the serial killer in a sort of anti-hero-hero kind of way.  The victims are usually "unscrupulous" people, who these movies tell us "deserve" to be punished. The problem is the punisher is  a maniac serial killer. This is a cultural Hollywood movement beginning with the Friday the 13ths, Halloweens and TCMs; probably the first of the super serial killers/serial killer sequels.

As a slasher flick fan, this was a great movie. Though NO. 6, it is fresh and creative. No Saw sequel would be complete without the voice and image of the original Jigsaw killer, with his raspy voice and thirst for vengeance. Of course, with the ending, Det Hoffman might live to kill again. Would've been nice if he had gotten his just reward in this one, leaving only the widow Jigsaw to carry on her departed serial-killer husband's legacy. With the exception of the first film in this series, they are all nail-biters, with fresh attention grabbing sped up endings, with something you did not expect to seal the deal.

I can live without a Saw 7, but if they make it, I will buy it sight unseen, just as I did this one. I cannot think of another series that had at least 3 sequels, and each was worth buying. The only negative I would have about the Saw series is that I have purchased each individually, knowing that one day Amazon will offer the entire series for half the total of the individuals. This Saw may be number six in the series, but , to me, it is number two , pertaining to which is the best.
