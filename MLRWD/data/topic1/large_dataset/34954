Hey, we all love John Carpenter's "The Thing" with the hidden alien force that slowly devoured all but two of the remaining scientists on the Antarctic. And "Escape from New York," "They Live," and "Prince of Darkness".

"Vampires" is an all around good horror/vampire movie, based around a vampire slayer team who manage to get killed down to a core group along with a Priest to help them. They go through some cool adventures and wind up killing 7 "Master" vampires, one of whom had lived for more than 600 years. The film ends with one teammember who had been bitten driving off in a van with his girlfriend (the vampiress who bit him) while the head vampire slayer and the Priest watch them go.

All around, this was a good Carpenter film; a lot was to be desired in comparison with his other amazing films (this was not a "Halloween"), but still, you can't help but see that this really was Carpenter: you have his trademarks - extreme suspense, some character development, and a good helping of gore and blood.

I recommend this film, with reservations. If you're bored and want a vampire movie that is well directed, go ahead. If you are new to the horror genre, watch another Carpenter like "The Thing".
