I've always liked the stylishness of DePalma's movies (even when they are relatively empty exercises: Body Double, Dressed to Kill).  I have always thought of Casualties of War as a very well-made adaptation of his singular style with a wrenchingly emotional story.  I saw it several times in the theater, owned it on VHS, and was anxious to see it again in DVD widescreen.
I was kicked in the teeth.  The emotional elements of the story resonate throughout the movie, working better because of DePalma's technique.  Watching such a sad story made me feel odd for thinking it is a beautiful movie but it really is beautiful.  Everyone in the movie, in his or her own way, is a casualty of war.
The DVD has some worthy extras (in addition to a striking presentation of the movie itself): a present-day interview with Michael J. Fox about his involvement in the movie; a present-day making-of documentary with extensive interviews with Brian DePalma and Art Linson (producer); and some brief deleted scenes.
I strongly recommend this DVD.
