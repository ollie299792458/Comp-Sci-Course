Well, given that this is a movie about Batman taking on Dracula, I didn't have high hopes as far as the plot, storyline and overall coherence were concerned. My roommate and I happen to be staunch fans of Batman and just thought we'd give it a try.

We weren't disappointed. Predictable and hazyplot, yes (Dracula doesn't seem too surprised to wake up in a modern city nowhere near Transylvania), but also excellent animation, some awesome, atmospheric music and a really cool Batman, and even more awesome Joker. This is a movie that teens will really enjoy, I guess (my roommate and I both agreed we'd have absolutely adored this movie if we had been thirteen!). This is also rather gory for a Batman movie which is to be expected but most of the vampire attacks are not shown directly (the camera zooms to a view of the Gotham skyline while the screams die off, or else quickly switches to a shadow on a nearby wall, of Dracula feasting on his victim).

In all, a movie for fans and teens. Fans may want to know that this movie features the Jerry Maguire line "You complete me" between Batman and Joker that was used to great effect in the Dark Knight. Did Christopher Nolan get his idea from watching this movie? I'd like to think so...
