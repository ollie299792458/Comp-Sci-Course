Sad but pretty close to the truth.  I really don't know what else to say.  It's our Country's Sad History.  People still use the N word freely.  This explains why so many of us take offense, even when our own use it. Boy, even at 50 and respected by his own, a grown man is referred to as Boy.  Some folks just don't understand why some of us are still angry.  Anger is an action word.  Without feeling it, things just don't get done.  It's as strong as Determination.  I love my black brothers, excuse me, Black Men.  Their fight is harder than any other race.  If they climb too high, either his own or some other race will try to pull him down. In Rosewood, all I saw were Black Men.  Even the youngest boy had to become a man, and he held up his position. Where are the young Arnet's today?  They are pretty busy calling each other N...and telling the those who were almost killed or died fighting for the right to be called MAN or WOMAN.  The word used to be a fighting word in my younger days...but then, so was the B word.  Young People, Learn the history of words before you use them so freely.  Watch this movie and others like it, and understand the Term is not endearing or a compliment. If you don't know your history, you are going to repeat it. Ignorance is not Bliss
