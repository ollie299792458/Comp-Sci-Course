This movie is rather disappointing.  The acting is adequate and the storyline is interesting, but there seem to be no surprises this time around.  The Creeper has ditched his scary old truck in favor of flying.  Overblown computer effects run rampant in this installment and fail to deliver any good moments.  The starry nighttime sky looks hopelessly fake.  The scariest scene of all, of the Creeper standing in the field, was cut out and can only be seen in the dvd deleted scenes section.  I didn't even have Florida locations to stimulate my interest in this flick, they shot it somewhere in California with mountains, even though it is supposed to be the same general area the Creeper haunted in the original.

My advice:  If you watched the original and enjoyed it, don't expect as much of this one.  This installment fails to measure up to the original.  It plays out like an episode of "Survivor".  I hope that whenever Victor Salva decides to do Jeepers 3 he goes back to his well-established talent for campfire storytelling demonstrated in the original. Also, I hope he brings back the truck and gives us more of the Creeper cloaked in his Civil War rags--that's when he is scariest!
