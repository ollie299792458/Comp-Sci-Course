When this first came out I hesitated to buy it - I didn't remember loving the movie when I was younger and didn't feel any particular need to have it. Having watched it now, however, as well as the entire second disc, I believe this is the most comprehensive and enjoyable Platinum Edition DVD Disney has ever released.

The movie itself was more engaging than I remembered, moving at a satisfying pace (a major concern for Walt, discussed in the Making Of bonus segment). Color and sound are improved - and yes, the aspect ratio is preserved in its original full-screen format.

Disc 2, though, is the real treasure - a rich collection of bonus features. One of the most enjoyable is a round-table discussion among current Disney artists and execs on Walt Disney's historical "Nine Old Men," the team of animators largely responsible for such pioneering movies as Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Peter Pan, Bambi, and others. During the conversation we learn about the evolution of animation as an art form, the revolutionary techniques developed at Disney, as well as a personal glimpse at each artist's background as well as their classic characters and scenes (including, in Cinderella, who animated the great, sophisticated facial expression on Cinderella as she receives the invitation and laughingly says, "perhaps I should interrupt the ... 'music' ... lesson"). We're also treated to some wonderful galleries, including concept art for the Cinderella-Prince dance sequence, which was originally envisioned as a dance in the stars.

This is a great presentation of a classic film which has aged gracefully, as well as some unique and insightful archival footage and storyboards. Recommended for anyone who enjoys Disney.
