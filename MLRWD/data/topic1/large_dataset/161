WARNING:Film includes domestic violence on a woman.  Doris Day portrays the real life of "Ruth Etting", a dancing showgirl in Chicago.  She is a kept woman who is struggling to get out of Chicago and utilize her talent to reach Broadway.  She gets involved with a gangster (James Cagney) who helps her reach Broadway, but turns her personal life into turmoil.  I do not care for the pairing of Doris Day and James Cagney.  It does not wash with me. They also worked together in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTEFUU">The West Point Story</a> (1950).  Strong performance by Doris Day.  Very dramatic picture.  Not a happy picture at all.  Includes violence against a woman.
  NOTE: Most of the domestic violence scenes and the rape scene was cut by the censors.
  Did you notice the blooper?  While Doris is in her gold outfit, she turns and her earring flys off her ear.  In the next shot, it is mysteriously back on.
  Doris sings, "You Made Me Love You" and "Ten Cents A Dance".
  The real Ruth Etting made thirty films.  One of them is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792844785">Roman Scandals [VHS</a>] (1933) where she played "Olga".
