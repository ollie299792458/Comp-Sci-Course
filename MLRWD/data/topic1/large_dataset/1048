This is without a doubt the coolest dvd collection I have seen (mostly referring to the packaging).  I think the packaging is spot-on for this collection and even though some have referred to it being a bit cheap, I have no problem with it at all.  I read where a few people had bad luck and found glue from the accordian case on the actual discs, but that was not the case with me.  All discs were glue-free and in excellent condition.  And what can I say about the shag carpet box?  A stroke of genius if you ask me!

Of course the content (the episodes) speaks for itself!  I loved The Brady Bunch growing up and it's like taking a trip down memory lane each time we watch (my kids, 10 and 5, love it)!  And the quality of the actual video is very nice as well.

I can highly recommend this dvd collection to any Brady Bunch fans!  Buy the collection...watch the dvds...be happy!  :-)
