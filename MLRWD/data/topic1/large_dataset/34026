Actors are in the range from great to correct, characters are interesting, there is material for a good story but... the pieces in the puzzle never come together.

The movie is not boring and there is a witty first description of disfunctional characters linked to each other through very peculiar and rather cold family relationships.

But that is all the movie gets at.

It completely fails when trying to put together a story. The characters' conflicts are resolved whith such simplicity that they become hard to believe and understand. Therefore the movie, which in theory appeals to one's feelings, becomes superficial and predictable and loses almost all credibility. It is as if the writer of a novel got tired of taking the time to give us a good first description of his/her characters and then tried to summarize and put an end to their conflicts in two pages, or furthermore, in a final paragraph that serves as an epilogue (actually part of the story's most important issues are resolved in a sequence of snapshots that accompany the movie's credits).

Smart People is well below other recent movies dealing with isolation and repressed human feelings like The Visitor.
