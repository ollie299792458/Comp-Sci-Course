I've actually owned this DVD for more than a year now, but I never bothered digging into the extras until recently, and I have to speak up on something.  I have always loved BTLC -it's a great film that doesn't take itself too seriously and Kurt Russell was perfect in his role.  Buy this DVD if you want a nice, remastered DTS soundtrack and a widescreen aspect -both are excellent.  However, the commentary track leaves a lot to be desired.  Better than two thirds of the duration of the film, all they did was turn down the volume and ramble on amongst themselves about film school theories and their careers.  THEY HARDLY EVEN DISCUSSED THE FILM!  What a wasted opportunity.  The few times that John Carpenter actually makes any commentary about the film, he giggles and laughs his way through the scene under scrutiny.

I'm glad they had fun making the movie, and it's wonderful that John thinks it was all a giant joke, but bring something we don't already know to the commentary track, please.
