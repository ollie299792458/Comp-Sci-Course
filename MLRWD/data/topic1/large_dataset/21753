I read the (...) review for this classic teen movie and while I agree that the script *is* a bit uneven (and that is typical for John Hughes), I couldn't *disagree* more that Ferris has lost its "effervescence". Just because it was made in the 80's? I just watched it with my three kids ages 8 to 15 and they loved it (and they aren't big fans of "old stuff").  This movie is about three smart goodhearted kids itching to be free and tweak the nose of the system without being mean-spirited or nasty in the process.  It is *timeless*.  Although, for those of us who left high school in the 80's, it is indeed a wonderful trip back to that era.  So what if Ferris's cool technology is outdated now??!  It's what he does with what he has that is ingenious and hilarious;  time has not diminished that.  I think this is the funniest teen movie ever made and one of the smartest as well. It's very hard to do both, apparently;  look at what's been made over time and I think you will agree.  A little slapstick doesn't really take away from the movie.  The story is still great.  The acting is top notch as well.  Watch the movie with its cornacopia of characters and notice that they are all having real fun in their roles.  Ben Stein made a whole second career out of his part. To this day most people think of Stein, not George Bush when they hear the term "Voodoo Economics"("anyone?  voo? voo?"). "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is smart, sweet, goofy, sarcastic, lively, caring, and most of all, not dark.  It is filled with color, light, and laughs.  And it never grows old.
