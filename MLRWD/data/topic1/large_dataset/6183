I never bought the first release of this DVD because those who did savaged it for its poor quality. I figured WB couldn't possibly make the same mistake twice. Maybe they didn't - maybe they just repackaged the rotten DVD they manufactured before. Seriously, this is absolutely the worst DVD I've ever seen from a major producer. The quality may not even match those cheapie Canadian tv transfers in the bargain bins. It looks worse than standard definition - hardly a horizontal line looks straight, and any lettering is blurry. Within each scene, the image jumps up and down from one frame to the next.  After 10 minutes, I stopped watching, and I really like this movie. The Amazon info (as of this day) is incorrect; the aspect ratio is extreme widescreen. However, the case says "enhanced", which is a flat-out lie. Perhaps they meant disenhanced.
  Maybe there's a problem with the film elements, but this movie never looked this bad in the theaters; people would have walked out if it did.
 Unless you are going to watch this on a 2" screen, or you're a serious collector of visual artifacts, I WOULD NOT BUY THIS INCREDIBLE PIECE OF GARBAGE. Caveat emptor.
 MUCH LATER: The Blu-ray disc is, however, excellent, and bargain-priced to boot. It is in the original aspect ratio (not 16:9) and looks great in a home theater. Amazing what Hyams was able to do before CGI - one of the best-looking SF films of its time. In the commentary, he says he originally wanted to do a western, and realized that they had become SF films. Shiny.
