For those of us in our 40's and 50's the Dick Cavett Show DVD is very memorable. Unless you are from that era, you may not appreciate the unexciting Dick Cavett but what a pleasure to be able to listen to many huge and very private Hollywood Stars who rarely gave interviews at that time. An incredible look into their lives. Dick Cavett's laid back style works perfectly in this particular setting and his open affection for Katharine Hepburn is both humorous and wonderful.

The Katharine Hepburn interview was worth the price of this DVD If you ever wanted to know anything about KH and her very private life, you won't be disappointed as she also talks about others whom she worked with or befriended. KH is indeed a very strong willed individual and was her own person throughout her life. Acting was her life and romances were few because there simply wasn't time.

Look, listen and feel good about the times when humor was simple and funny without having to be vulgar or X-Rated. How refreshing to watch a classic movie and see the two partners walk upstairs to the bedroom while leaving the rest up to your imagination. Well, this DVD gives you the same refreshing feeling. See Bette Davis as you may never have before, watch Alfred Hitchcock with his double talking, if you could understand it.

Bedroom, Rec room, Living room, wherever! Toss a dozen pillows on the floor or the bed and watch this DVD in total comfort, it'll do you a world of good!
