Oliver Tate is a somewhat maudlin, not-so-nice young man in his middle teens who finds himself wrestling with adult experiences for the first time in this well-written, sensitively directed first film from Richard Ayoade (The IT Crowd, The Mighty Boosh).

He has fallen in love with Jordana Bevan, a classmate whose haircut and appearance reminded me very much of the great silent film femme fatale Louise Brooks.  Jordana herself is not so pleasant, she's a rather remote young lady who is not above bullying her less fortunate classmates.  Oliver, however, is smitten, and sets about trying to win her love.

Meanwhile, Oliver's parents seem to be slowly drifting apart: his father suffers from bouts of depression and his mother is becoming way too close to an old beau, a new age guru, for Oliver's comfort.  Oliver can see his family on the verge of falling apart and it drives him to desperate acts.

These characters struggle through their lives against a gloomy Welsh seaside background that is a perfect reflection of their moods.  None of these people is from Sunnybrook Farm, they definitely have theiri all to human flaws.  But they also have a strange beauty and the story resonates wonderfully as an authentic piece of the human experience.

Well done.
