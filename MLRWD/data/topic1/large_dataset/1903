I bought the TurboFire DVD set a year ago, and I still enjoy the workouts.  I think the infomercial is pretty dead on with the advertisement.  It's an intense workout, and one of my favorite things about the workouts is the music!  Most workout DVDs have the same old beat music, but these DVDs have songs that I used to dance to in the 90s.  Boom I Got Your Boyfriend, Dazy Dukes, Push It, Wiggle It, Le Freak...  I also like that there is a wide variety of workout times.  Sometimes I only have time for a 20 minute workout, and I know that with the HIIT 20 I'm still going to get in a really good workout in the short amount of time that I have.  And when I have more time for a longer workout, it's a great feeling to do a full hour of this.

I can't say that my body has been transformed, but that is 100% my fault.  I'm very inconsistant with my workouts.  Some weeks I may only do 1 or 2 workouts (or even 0), other weeks I might to 4.  I can say that when I really commit myself and do 4 workouts a week, I do start seeing a change within a week or two.  Maybe by writing this review it will motivate me to get in more workouts every week!
