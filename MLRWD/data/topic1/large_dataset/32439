I had the privilege of seeing this film in the theatre, attending on the strong recommendation of a friend of mine in film school.  I had no idea that years later it would become, and remain, my all-time favorite movie.  I won't go into plot or character or name-dropping or anything here.  Check out one of the other reviews for that; and there are some good ones.  I just want to express how excellent this movie is, and recommend it to anyone and everyone.  You don't have to be a bowler, stoner, or nihilist to enjoy this classic.  You don't even have to be a fan of well-made, beautifully filmed, and hilariously-directed, albeit directionless, comedy.  But I do think you have to appreciate the fine art of the film quote.  Or at least love the small detail of the scene, or be a fan of masterful  performance.  Or maybe you're in the mood for a send-up of a detective story gone completely awry.  I don't know.  But the film has appeal, no doubt about it, as anyone who has attended or seen pictures of a Lebowski Fest will attest. ( I'm still trying to convince my wife that a week of vacation spent at one these Fests is a worthwhile escapade.)  Whether I make it to a celebration of what-have-you or not, I've always got The Dude.  And I don't know about you, but I take a bit of comfort in that, knowing he's out there, taking it easy for all us sinners.  Aw, shucks.  I sure hope he makes the finals.  In my book, he's the champ, and has yet to be dethroned.
