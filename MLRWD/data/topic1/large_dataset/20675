Had anyone associated with this movie read Victor Hugo's soul-moving book, they would have known that Jean Valjean could not possibly have backhanded Cosette while screaming accusations in her face, nor could he have repeatedly smashed Javert's head against a rock wall. Such thoughts and impulses had been removed from his spirit, and he absolutely adored Cosette.  The bishop, so near to God in the book, was played here with a ecclesiastical and superior manner.  Without looking into the souls of the characters, which this movie did not do, their actions cannot be explained.  Read the unabridged book, then watch the French version with Gerard Depardieu. If you read the book, you will not miss the lack of subtitles.  Another version worth watching is the 1978 version with Anthony Perkins as Javert.  Anthony Perkins was BORN to play Javert; his interpretation brings the book to life.  To my sorrow, the movie is chopped apart and has the most appalling Disneyland ending. As a postscript, stumbling across the 10th Anniversary London concert, sold on DVD and CD as "The Dream Cast in Concert," brought me to my knees in tears and praise, caused me to buy and read the "New Unabridged Paperback" which I am now rereading, and ultimately to purchase tickets to fly to London to see the musical at Her Majesty's Theatre.  I confess to having fallen completely in love with this story!
