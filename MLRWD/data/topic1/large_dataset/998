Mike Leigh's slice of life movies such as High Hopes, All or Nothing, Secrets & Lies, Career Girls and his previous movie Happy-Go-Lucky, (with astonishing performances by Sally Hawkins and Alexis Zegerman), are at the opposite end of the spectrum from Hollywood Blockbusters. They are understated and believable. Within this realm of slowly moving observation events become magnified leaving one invested in developments. After somewhat of a detour with the well-crafted Topsy-Turvy and Vera Drake, Leigh has returned to contemporary setting with his last two movies. Perhaps Another Year doesn't pack the punch of Happy-Go-Lucky, but it doesn't have to, that's not the point. Somewhat reminiscent of his 1980 Grown Ups, also featuring Lesley Manville, Another Year has more space to explore the inner workings of the characters.  Like Fassbinder, Leigh has an entourage of versatile actors to work with. Lesley Manville and Ruth Sheen are mainstays in his films and, particularly Manville; expectedly turn out first-rate performances. If you are looking for explosions or mystery don't look to Mike Leigh, but if you want to watch an atmospheric, beautifully realized drama with real dialog that will resonate long after the end credits roll, he's your man. After decades of making these compelling movies Leigh's special talents have not tarnished.
