An excellent movie is more than the sum total of its parts. With Robert DeNiro, Marlon Brando, and Ed Norton as protagonists, this movie manages to be quite good, but certainly not excellent. Marlon Brando and Robert DeNiro are surprisingly weak in their respective roles of "the arranger" and "the master thief", providing characters that are believable but not truly memorable. 
Ed Norton manages to create a vivid character in his rendition of an ambitious, talented, but novice criminal who has valuable insider information critical to the planned heist. Without Norton's role, I would have probably slept through the movie as DeNiro and Brando were effectively on autopilot. If you are watching this movie to see DeNiro and Brando at their finest, turn elsewhere. 
This movie showcases Norton who appears 1/4 of the way into the movie, so before his arrival you'll probably find yourself saying to yourself, "This is a really, really slow movie." But when Norton enters the scene, there is actual tension and dramatic suspense. You'll find yourself caring about the characters, and actively wondering whether they'll be able to pull off the heist. There is even some comic relief in Norton's dual role of the calculating, ruthless criminal on the one hand and the naive, mentally challenged janitor on the other.
So, the first 25% of the movie is mediocre. The second 25% of the movie which sets up the heist is good, and the last half is almost excellent. You'll also see some twists in the plot near the end. Overall, this isn't an excellent movie, but it's worth seeing, and you'll probably leave the theatre satisfied.
