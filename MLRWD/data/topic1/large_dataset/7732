This is one of those movies which everyone feels that they have to praise, so as to appear savvy and sophisticated. That's what conventional wisdom does. Kind of like not wanting to acknowledge a slight attraction to your own sex, it seems that some people feel the need to praise this film as high art, instead of plainly admitting that it's overrated nonsense that happened to earn high regard in the art and entertainment worlds during the sixties. Though, it is important to remember that many were in an altered state during this time. To be unusual does not automatically make something great or outstanding.

What's obvious is that the initial intention was to make a movie set in 'Swinging London' with the main character being a trendy fashion photographer. Plot and details weren't important for success $$$$. Subsequently, the masses have tried to project deep meaning onto this commercial film, which is as ridiculous as trying to find meaningful love in a horror or comedy. Honestly, the meaning is that there is no meaning; it's like a very long and pointless commercial or advertisement on TV. It's not about the product (what should be a good film with a plot), it's about the image.
