The plot was typical and predictible from the start.
The 3 main characters all "cop an attitude" in a major way.  They are juvenile, rude, arrogant, and shallow.  However, the characters inexplicibly risk their lives at points for each other, but it is not clear why.  Although they say it is "how one behaves in a pack", one is left guessing why they are looking out for one another at all, considering their apparent selfishness and rudeness.  It seemed to me that the acts were spur of the moment insticts to protect their buddies.
The movie does not have a truly virtuous character.  The only character I liked was Scrat, who wasn't really a character so much as comic interlude - much needed as the other attempts at humor were uninspired (examples: poop on your head, clumsy characters falling off cliffs, sight gags, characters who won't shut up, the usual parodies of popular films, etc.).
It also had the all-too-typical "don't kill animals" message.  What I'd like to know is what the tiger was supposed to eat.
What did I like?  Some of the animation, and the Scrat scenes.  Unfortunately, a lot of the animation was primitive, with many cheats being obvious (lack of motion blur in places, primitive motion of the adult humans, a terrible job with the tiger's mouth).  But much of the animation was state-of-the-art, and some was quite impressive - Scrat and the sloth were well done, and the ice slide was nice animation even though it wasn't nearly as gripping as similar scenes in earlier movies.
