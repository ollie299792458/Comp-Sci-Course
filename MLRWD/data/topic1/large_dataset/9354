I saw this version originally when I was twelve.  Soon after I saw what turned out to be the the first remake in a video store and wanting to see it again talked my parents into renting it. Even then I knew it wasnt the same movie. Thankfully Peter Jackson came along years later and not only remade it a second time but stayed true to the original story. Some people may get mad at me for saying that but I dont care.  Other than to have King Kong and Ann become friends he didnt change the story at all. At least not in a way that would be obvious plot wise. If you want to watch a remake get Jacksons or the extented edition which is ten times better. Otherwise get this one. The firt remake should be left alone. Period. Unless you want to watch an inferior verion that is filled with flaws.As i already said other than to have King Kong and Ann become friends Jackson didnt change the story in any way that would stick out like a sore thumb. There are changes sure. Jack Driscols job is an example. In this one hes the ships first mate. In Jacksons he was a playwrite. But oter than having King Kong and Ann become friends changes like that youll have to search for by watching both movies which I would recomend. But except for the fact that this one is in black and white and Jacksons is in color I have pointed out the only difference that would stick out like a sore thumb and I dont need to mention it again. Both movies are very good. Peter Jacksons is better but that shouldnt stop you from watching this one. I have both of them. Coopers and Jacksons.
