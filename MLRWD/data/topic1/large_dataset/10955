If my opinion counts for anything, I found this to be an exceptional film. Intentional or not, the film's low quality production is quite ironic and has the effect of drawing the viewer into and analysis of content rather than form. The story, which other reviewers have described in good detail, is an allegory of the male seeking hopelessly to control and objectify the body of a female. The dark and unseen creature in the closet is the id, beyond suppression, always near escape. The semiotics are almost too self evident to be coincidence, and there is a lot more to this story that I can cover in a brief right-up. The jazz sound track is subtle and creepy, and reminiscent of David Lynch. The nihilistic ending is unlike any other film of this type, or any other film of this time period, for that matter. Far ahead of it's time, and unfortunately still too sophisticated for contemporary viewers, The Brain That Wouldn't Die is one of those rare gems that will only divulge it's secret genius to those who are willing listen.
