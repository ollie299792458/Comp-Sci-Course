This movie attempts to show the effects that 2 of the world's most notorious conflicts have on today's society.  Namely, the World War 2 and the Israel - Palestine tension. In the film, Eyal's assassination of a Hamas leader is one of many by-products of the tension between Israel and Palestine.  In being tasked with tracking down a Nazi war criminal, Eyal is now faced with the fallouts that the World War 2 has on Jews and Germans, particularly the descendants of Germans who had lived through World War 2 and who perhaps may have participated in the war itself.

The film achieves a perfect balance in telling the story of violent conflicts and their after-effects as well as the story of human prejudices and reconciliation.  This is achieved through the softening of hard facts told in the story by the human emotions and relationships built up in in the film, thereby making this film easy to watch.  The film ends on a hopeful note for the world by emphasizing on two of the greatest of all human emotions: love and reconciliation.
