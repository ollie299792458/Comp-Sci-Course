OK, so Apatow has plugged into a profitable formula for comedies, and he's staying true to his format. Where's the crime in that? His movies are funny and appeal to the broad 17-54 audience.

I thought the movie was very entertaining. All of the characters were veryt likeable on some level. There really isn't a villain in the film (Well, maybe the puppet Van Helsing). The main characters show that people are shades of grey, not black and white.

Unlike many comedies tat find it necessary to wedge in some ill-fitting hollywood "names" that ham up their minor roles, this film did not go there. The supporting cast all act within a believable space, though some are a bit of a push toward the edges (the inexperienced newlyweds) or the stereotype (the surfing instructor).

Bottom line -- this film doesn't disappoint, and leaves you feeling that no matter how bad life seems, things can always get better if you stay true to yourself and pursue a happy life. It's a nice 2-hour escape.
