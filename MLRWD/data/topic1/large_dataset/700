First off, I've read the story this movie is based on and the movie was way better in my opinion.  Not all Stephen King stories end up as better than okay movies...in fact, very few of them do.  This is one of them and I'd have to give the praise mainly to choosing Johnny Depp to play the main character.

Mort Rainey is a semi-famous writer who is going through a nasty divorce from his wife, who has another man in her life.  He retires to a cabin and starts work, only to be interrupted by a man named Shooter, who claims that Mort stole his story.  Mort is already on the edge due to his divorce and this sets him down the garden path of self-destruction.  He stumbles around the cabin in a ratty old bathrobe and with messed up hair half the time (a real plus if you enjoy seeing Johnny Depp looking like he just woke up in the morning after a hard night out) and can't seem to prove to the man that he wrote the story first and can't seem to deal with his wife leaving him for someone else.

If just about anyone else had been playing the part of Mort, you would have had much less sympathy for his character...especially near the end of the movie.  As it was, the final scenes created odd feelings in the audience.  I won't give it away, but this dissonance was fascinating since the movie basically gave you everything from Mort's perspective and made you feel what he felt, even if you knew it was wrong.

Writers might find this movie even more interesting.  Johnny Depp fans will like, especially since he's in just about scene and does a great understated job of bringing the miserable life of Mort Rainey to reality.  It's not Johnny's best movie by any means, but its oddly and secretly fascinating all the same.
