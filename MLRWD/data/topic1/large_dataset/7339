I originally fell in love with this series when it debuted on AMC, so I cannot comment on how it stacks up to the comic book version that it is based off of.  The Blu-ray contains all six of the episodes that make up the first season.  My only complaint comes from that fact, six episodes leaves me desperately wanting more.  The zombie's in the series are beautifully done.  They stay true to the slow dumb zombie mold as opposed to the fast and thinking zombies that appear in some movies.  The zombie story has been told before, the main character wakes up from a coma to world that is incredibly different from the one he knew (stop me if this sounds familiar).  What sets this series apart from the countless other zombie stories out there is the character development.  The character story lines are wonderfully done and leave the viewer feeling a connection to the survivors.

The blu-ray quality on these were a little off-putting.  There were some scenes that were very grainey and kind of annoying.  I kind of overlooked it however because of how much a fan of the series I am, but if you're a person who dwells on blu-ray quality you may not be too happy with this.

Any fan of zombie fiction will love this series and I personally can't wait to see what direction they take it in.  After watching the first season I have become curious as to what the comics were like and may end up checking those out to see how different it is from the television portrayal.
