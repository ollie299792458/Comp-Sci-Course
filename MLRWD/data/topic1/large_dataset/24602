This movie has the misfortune to remind one - or at least me - of the previous attempt to film the same story - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304696515">Dangerous Liaisons</a> - and it is clear that Sarah Michelle Gelar and Ryan Phillippe are not in the same league as Glenn Close and John Malkovich.

Then again, the comparison in this particular case is pretty pointless. The two movies share some names and many plot details, but they could hardly have been more different. Indeed, the the basic plot does seem much more suitable to a teen comedy ('Cruel Intentions') than to a film noir set in, of all places, eighteenth-century France ('Dangerous Liaisons'). As a matter of fact, 'Cruel Intentions' deserves three stars only because of the cleverness with which the original story was adapted to modern times and high-school mentality.

Speaking of 'Cruel Intentions' alone, the movie is more than teenage dirty talk and flippant sexual intrigues - neither of which contains anything shocking for anybody older than 12 years indeed. Towards the end the story gets pretty serious and there are few highly dramatic scenes between Sarah Michelle Gelar and Ryan Phillippe which are not without merit, both as dialogue and as acting. Reese Witherspoon gives a fine perfomance as well.

For what's worth, the movie is hugely entertaining but with the right dose seriousness to make well worth watching. It's about the facts of life: love, hate, vanity, pride, envy, malice. Most negative qualities, admittedly, but common to all of us none the less for that.

P. S. It's great to the cameo of Swoosie Kurtz, the only 'common denominator' with 'Dangerous Liaisons'.
