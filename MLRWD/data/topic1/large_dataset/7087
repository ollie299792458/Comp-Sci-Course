The negative portrayal of the French Army in this fine film, based on a true incident that became a still-powerful novel by Humphrey Cobb, so outraged the French Government that they would not give any help in the making of this film, even though 54 exhausted divisions of the French Army mutinied in 1917 against any further futile attacks against the Germans. So Kubrick and Douglas ironically shot the film near Munich Germany, with many off-duty Munich police playing Franch poilu in a 5000 yard German pasture expertly transformed into a WWI battlefield. The "French" chateau was Schleissheim palace near Dachau Concentration Camp. As a result of French pique the film was not shown in France until 1975.

However the most ironic touch was to give the role of the drunken, cowardly Lt. Roget to real-life actor/WWII hero Wayne Morris, who left Hollywood in 1942 to join the U.S. Naval Reserve. As a USNR combat pilot assigned to the U.S.S. Essex, he shot down 7 Japanese planes and was awarded 4 DFC's and 2 Air Medals for helping sink 5 Japanese ships.
