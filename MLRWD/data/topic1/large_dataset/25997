I loved this movie.  I have watched it several times and enjoy it every time.  It is a movie about a very serious and true event that adds enough humor and comic touches throughout it to keep it interesting and entertaining.  
A down and out, twice divorced, single mother desperately looking for a job finally bullies her way into a job in a law office using the excuse that since her lawyer lost her injury case that he said she would win that he owed her.  
She ends up looking into some real estate files that have medical records attached to them and is confused.  As she delves deeper, she is shocked and horrified at finding that a major energy company has been dumping toxic chromium waste knowing that it is getting into the water system and making people sick, etc.  She convinces her boss to help the people by taking the matter to court.  Absolutely fascinating!
Her choice of clothes is not the demure business type but more on the floozy side.  The cast of characters are absolutely outstanding and work perfectly together.  I highly recommend the movie! Enjoy!
