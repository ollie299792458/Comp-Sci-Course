As a teenager I watched this movie near religiously for about a year straight.  It was always on.  My VHS copy was worn in places because whenever friends were over and nothing was going on this movie would inevitably get thrown into the VCR.  It was like an antidote to living in the suburbs.  Gritty, crazy, violent, artistic, cool, scary, funny, beautifully shot and written, like nothing I had ever seen before yet somehow exactly like everything I had seen before, Reservoir Dogs is the definition of a cultural landmark for me.
That was fifteen years ago and the amazing thing is that it is still going strong.  The movie itself stands up beautifully, but the details and general...I don't know...Tarantino-ness of it continue to amaze me.  I recently even went on a Reservoir Dogs music kick, listening not to the soundtrack, but to all the songs that get discussed by the characters or referred to by the fictitious radio station which permeates most scenes.
This is just a long way around to say that this movie has artistic legs that have carried it through almost twenty years now with amazing strength and that, in my opinion, it will continue to have relevance and artistic merit even after twenty more years have passed.
