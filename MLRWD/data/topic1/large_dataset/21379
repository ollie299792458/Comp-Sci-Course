I can't add much to this that the previous reviews did not already say.  But I do disagree with Thomas Baldwin's note to the weak hearted: "WARNING this movie is not for the faint of heart it contains scenes of explicit violence and gore! If you do not have a strong stomach get the R rated version." If you have a problem wih excessive gore and violence, you should not watch this movie period, R-rated or Un-rated.  This movie tries it's hardest to offend, and for that reason more than any other it will always be considered a classic(unless you consider the zombie kung-fu priest/zombie nurse love scene).  With the upcoming "Lord of the Rings" movies coming out, I am curious to see the general audience's reactions to this movie as they dig up the old Peter Jackson films.  For that matter that probably applies to all of his older movies, excluding maybe "Heavenly Creatures" and "Frighteners". Come to think of it "Heavenly" was pretty weird also...
