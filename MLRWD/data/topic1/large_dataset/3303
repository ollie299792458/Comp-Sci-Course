My son and I watch these over and over and discuss the stories, characters, and meanings, as well as the differences in the art work. He is 5 and has an amazing vocabulary due to my husband and I reading to him daily(not just at bedtime) since birth, as well as him listening to us converse over the years. We also spoke to him as we do each other since he was very little, and I got into a habit early on of introducing a new word to him daily with its meaning and examples of its meaning. These "stories come to life" present many opportunities for learning, and I enjoy them as much as he does!! Learning can happen under any circumstance. I read a very negative review which frankly, I was shocked about, that said it is just another way parents can shirk the responsibility of interacting with their child. Well sure, if that is what you CHOOSE to do, however, this collection was not designed with that intention at all. It is a wonderful springboard to inspire the imagination! Books should always be the first choice, but I see this as a lovely supplement to inspiring a child's imagination, introduce him/her to other cultures, and expand their vocabulary, as well as nurture a love of different art styles. I plan on buying collections for all my friends' kiddos as soon as I can afford it!!
