Movies that are about the script and 'the message'.

OR

Movies that are made to entertain us.

(And on rare occasions, some movies manage to cover both)

Stealth happens to fall in the second category and is by no means a 3 star movie. No, the script is not an Academy Award winner. Let's face it, this movie is not about a deeper message and did not make it a point to be overly believable. But....lets also be honest, it's quite the entertainment flick with characters that possess enough realism to make the movie solid on that front. The visuals in this movie are stunning to watch, everyone in the movie is beautiful (always a positive), and the script is not entirely predicatable which is a definite plus in this genre.

If you want to critique how bad a movie is, why not bash movies that tried for the first category and failed miserably. Stealth did not falter as an action flick and despite some pretty cheesy lines and an emotionally distraught stealth bomber (sarcasm people), this was an entertaining movie that I would recommend. I would also recommend watching 'Requiem for a Dream' for those that are looking for a good movie of the first variety I described. That does not mean both cannot receive good reviews because, again, we're talking about two different kinds of movies.

Conclusion: This is eye candy of the highest degree and worth watching if you're looking for some ENTERTAINMENT. (The movie also has some AWESOME music!! Check out the extra 'The Music of Stealth'....FASCINATING)
