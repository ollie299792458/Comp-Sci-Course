Black Sunday AKA The Mask Of Satan was one of the most loving visual tributes to the classic gothic horrors of the past.  I just got the new DVD of the film and it is absolutely amazing.  The black and white picture  quality is stellar, very reminiscent to the crystal sharpness of the Boris  Karloff Thriller TV show but shot by the cinematography master Mario Bava.  Imagine a  photographic art book, with all of the vibrant black and white  imagery you would expect from such a high publication.  But this one moves!  I wish the Universal Classic Horror DVDs could somehow look this good!  The  menu is a lot of fun, looking like old lobby cards with a Paul Frees voice  over from some old promo ad.  The commentary track, while containing some  stretches of silence, is very very informative.  Plus, an equally crystal  sharp trailer, posters, pics, and notes.
The film is a bit gruesome and  gory at moments, but you could not find better black and white Gothic  Horror eye candy anywhere!  Bravo to all involved on the movie and the DVD!  I believe that Image is coming out with a VHS tape as well.
