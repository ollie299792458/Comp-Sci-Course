Hollywood has once again unleashed Steven Seagal onto our screens, and in brutal fashion. Seagal, the real life holder of a 7th degree black belt in Aikido, hits back at some Jamacan drug cartel bosses after they try to execute his family. However if your gonna mess with Steven Seagal you better make your first shot count because then It's his turn! Superb martial arts sequences ensure that the viewers adrenaline levels are peaked until the final credits have rolled.
This is one of Steven Seagal's first movies and indeed one of the best in my opinion. With a straight foward storyline that is held together well throughout the course of the feature, Seagals unique acting style and a strong support cast this one is a winner for any action fan. If you liked Hard To Kill and Above The Law you will enjoy this to. Seagal, being much younger and fitter than in recent years, moves with the grace and speed of a cat, incapacitating foes with lightning ferocity. I recommend that you rent or buy this great picture from Fox Studios immediately, sit back on the couch with a box of pop corn and enjoy 90 minutes of pure, 100% action. Cheers from TAZZI!
