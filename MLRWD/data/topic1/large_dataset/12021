This show probably couldn't have been made tody, on so many levels... but so what?

It was from a far less complex, more innocent time. Where men could actually watch shows like this without being considered a pig, or worse.

However, this show was a Hell of a lot of fun. A lot of people may compare this to Bewitched, and even have said some very naughty things about it's star, Barbra Eden. Yes, Bewitched was a great show, but I love this show because of it's downright silliness and irrevernt humor.

There were a lot of things restored here that I had never seen in the cut prints, such as the " live action" beginning of the second episode, about the mythical girl in the bottle playing spin the astronaut... and the scene in the first show where Jeannie steps out of Tony's bedroom wearing one of his shirts.

And obviously little else.

I also seem to remember the NBC censors giving them trouble over Barbra Eden's navel...

As to color vs black and white, who cares? The show is still fun, whatever version you get.
