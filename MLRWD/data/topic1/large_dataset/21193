I have fond memories of watching these back in the 80's. Late at night, PBS would dole out their dose of the BBC- Benny Hill, Dr. Who and if you were lucky, Hitchhikers. Adam's tale, which could now safely be called classic, is well known. His cynical yet hopeful look at humanity through the eyes of Earth's sole survivor shows us how absurd life (and human nature) really is. Even though you can practically see the strings, I wouldn't have it any other way. This is comfort viewing at its finest.

It was a treat to see the extras, even though I flew through them in one evening. I was quite surprised to learn that Douglas Adams was the actor who played the disgruntled human that returns to the sea. However while watching the "outtakes", I got the sense that the actors were all business. Watch the outtakes from the average American comedy and you're treated to self-deprecating laughs, jabs from the costars and the standard 'Who cares if this shoot is costing us $5,000 an hour, we can afford it" antics. These actors were downright apologetic and mad at themselves for a flub. The other bits were more entertaining though and it makes a nice overall package for any fan.
