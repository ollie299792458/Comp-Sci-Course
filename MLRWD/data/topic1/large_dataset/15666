If you need any more explanation than what others have said before me, let me be plain... this movie leaves you feeling depressed. Even when it gives you a happy ending, whoops I've blown it for you... 90% of a depressing film with a 10% happy ending is ummm, what is that? A depressing film!

The cast is likable enough, you will forgive them only perhaps because you have seen them in other films which you liked. This is one of those films you have to ask yourself, why did these actors agree to make it?

It had no chance of being a blockbuster, or even an indie sleeper, and if this was made out of love, well then that love seems to be for the German original "Mostly Martha". Why not just refund everyone and buy a big billboard in every major city that says, go see the original.

1 star for the movie, another star for Abigail Breslin who is worth watching even in a crappy "romantic comedy" masquerading as a fun date movie. Yes by all means bring someone to this movie, that is if you plan on breaking up with them! But wait, what was the worst part of this film? No it wasn't the actors, or the plot, it was the food. This is a food movie that doesn't even leave you feeling hungry in the end.
