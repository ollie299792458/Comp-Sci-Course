The finest film of the three and easily the best science fiction film of the past half-century, Robocop 3 is a film epic.

Few films are able to successfully combine the meta-ideas that haunt Mary Shelley's work and appropriately transform the tenets of Victorian horror to the screen.  Robocop 3 accomplishes this masterfully, yet also manages to retain the subtleties of character not seen in a script since Hoffman's and Bancroft's work in "The Graduate".

The cinematic special effects wizardry are perhaps only dwarfed by the Oscar-worthy performances of this elite ensemble cast. In the hands of this clever and artful set of actors the amazingly rich script blossoms like Netherlands tulip fields. Richly woven into every scene are shades of texture and plot that Ridley Scott himself would do well to learn. Absorbing the carefully crafted plot is like imbibing the best of Hitchcock. The sci-fi cinemetography brings that of the Star Wars series to but a pale comparison.  Opulant in its expression of new ideas, this film is nothing less than ground breaking.

This is a film that truly deals with man's struggle with himself and an increasingly impersonal, mechanized world -- yet it is capable of other scales too as these struggles are cast against a backdrop of social class turmoil *and* a rich commentary on the effects of globalization on local communities.

I imagine it would be hard for the team that created this to top themselves.
