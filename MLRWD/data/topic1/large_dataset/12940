O.K. time the official review. Just picked up last copy at BestBuy (sold out in a day). The 4 stars for picture is acurate. Solid HD Picture no grain, artifacting, unwanted movement except on stock footage of flight scenes (mostly at the start of film). Beautiful picture. The audio more than meets the challenge of this movie. One observation, as mentioned the DTS has some certain advantages over Dolby True HD. Well I am here to confirm, the DTS option is by FAR the best track on the disk. Much more dynamic, immersive, and just plain louder by several DBs. I found it an obvious choice, much to my dismay over the HD audio. And yes unlike alot of people, I do have it set up correctly. More than correctly. I am using King Cobra Audioquest interconnects for the 5.1 channel outs from the XA1 to my Denon 3806. I think there may be some mistake with sound. Usually it's the TrueHD that has the difference. Maybe they are mislabeled on the disk? Bottom line: Not only is this a MUST HAVE for your HDDVD collection, but a great example of what HDDVD delivers to the experience. I have a dedicated theater room. 133" screen and sound to match, even have real Buttkickers in the theater chairs. This movie makes my investment worth every penny. Word of caution: If you don't have a serious system, the sound will punkout your system. Listen at low levels or pony up and get something with some backbone '' High current Denon, Pioneer elite, Yamaha 2700 or higher or seperates like B&K, Krell, Macintosh etc). Extreme cinematic dynamics, just like the movies, and isn't that the whole idea? Highly Recommended
