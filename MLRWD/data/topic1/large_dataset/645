There was definitely a miss communitcation with the product I bought from this seller. They had wrote that the product was the complete series of The Sopranos. Instead I got seasons 1-5, so I did not receive the final season. Apparently in the bottom of the product description it had said that the last season was not included. This is very misleading when the advertisement of the product said the COMPLETE series. I was unaware that you can call a series complete and not include the final season. The package was also sent in a box that was a former box for some exercise equipment and taped up in a ridiculous manner, not a very good way to send DVDs. Also, one of the seasons was in a worse condition than the rest of the set because the bottom of the case was torn off and this was not described in the description. I admit that by some reason I did not see the disclaimer saying it was just the 5 seasons, but when I went to return it the very same day that I got it, the seller refused to take it back. They had said that they do not accept return items unless they are damaged or don't show up. This return policy was not written anywhere or present in the entire buying process. I emailed the seller about this and he said he will not allow me to return the items unless Amazon tells him to do so. He then ended his email by saying, "If you concerned about season 6 why not buy it for 8.00?" There are many things wrong with this statement. And I guarantee that you cannot find season 6 for that price. Therefore he was being quite unreasonable and slightly disrespectful. I would just advise people to not conduct "business" with this seller. Unless you want to be put through a hassle and not be able to return something unwanted the very same day you have received it.
