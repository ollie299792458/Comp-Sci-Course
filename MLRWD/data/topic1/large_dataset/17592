If you're looking for a great romantic comedy about immigration law, this isn't it- watch the 1990 film Green Card with G&eacute;rard Depardieu and Andie MacDowell.  But who really says to themself "tonight I want to watch a great romantic comedy on the theme of immigration law?" besides immigration lawyers, of course?

That aside-

I'm a big Sandra Bullock fan.  I'll watch anything with her in it because she is such a charming actress- unfortunately this means I've watched alot of really bad movies- she can really pick some stinkers, can't she?  This wasn't as good as Miss Congeniality but oodles better than The Net or While You Were Sleeping - this is more in the Two Weeks Notice vein, but without the preachy politics that tainted that film.

Is the movie predictable?  Of course.  All romantic comedies are predictable- that's what it means to work in a genre.  But it uses the tools of the genre well, and was well done.

Betty White is a particular treat, and the scene where the bijoun frise gets scooped up by the eagle is fantastic.  Well worth watching.
