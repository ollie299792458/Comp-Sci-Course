This was easily one of the worst movies I've seen, and the worst Resident Evil movie ever made.

This series needs a serious "reboot" and Paul S "Mediocrity" Anderson Needs to get far far away from it. Main characters that came off so well from the last movie are killed off without rhyme or reason in some anti climatic zombie rush fest. The plot has absolutely nothing to do with any of the games, and Mill jovininich phones in her performance as an Angry Alice.

You'll notice the second movie was very very close to the second game and it was still awesome for people who may have not played it. Directors like Paul seem to think they need to deviate from the games so "regular" audiences can relate to it, but that is such BS. If you tell a good story in the established game world, they'll come no matter what. I'm baffled why we couldn't have had a code veronica movie, or even a RE Nemesis movie and why we got this mediocrity.

This is defintely a rental and not a purchase, unless you're just looking to complete your collection. You're money is probably better spent on the new CG movie RE: Degeneration than this.
