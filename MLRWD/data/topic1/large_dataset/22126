This story of a Jewish woman in search of her father (separated from him as a child in 1927 Russia), in a time when the world was on the verge of war, is heartbreaking and very real. It is low key but I was riveted. You can feel the underlying tension of knowing, and the subtle buildup of the inevitable invasion of Paris. It chilled me to the bone in one part to hear the sounds of the Germans marching into the city. The movie, considered a sleeper, shows the frightening reality of what it was like to be there at that time in our history and potentially in danger if you were Jewish, a gypsy, homosexual, etc. The acting was superb. John Turturro (Dante), brilliantly plays an Italian arrogant, selfish, self-centered, manipulative opera singer who tries with no success to ingratiate himself romantically into Suzie's life (Christina Ricci, the heroine of the film). Her performance was also excellent. The look on her face throughout the film shows her haunted, yet with a quiet strength in her determination to eventually reconnect with her father. Her rejection of Dante causes her friend and Dante's ex-lover Lola (played brilliantly by Cate Blanchett who's Russian accent was excellent) to leave Paris and go to America because her life was in danger. In the interim Suzie has fallen for Cesar, a gypsy horseman played by Johnny Depp, yet another excellent performance. Some people are comparing this gypsy role with the one he played in Chocolat. There is no similarity except for him being softspoken and unassuming. Definitely not a "character reprisal". Not Depp's style. The only character he's reprising is his pirate, Jack Sparrow which by now the whole world is aware of.
The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the ending. The second it ended, it was like I was thrown into shock. Not one for abrupt endings unless the film warrants it. This one did not. But don't let it stop you from seeing this movie. Really holds your attention. I'm so glad I bought it.
