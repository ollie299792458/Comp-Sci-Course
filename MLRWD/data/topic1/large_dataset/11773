If you know me personally I know what you are going to say! You are probably going to say that I love this movie because Ben Affleck is in it! Truth be told I had no idea WHO Ben Affleck was until I saw Chasing Amy, in fact my friend practically dragged me to see this movie, which I am extrememly glad he did. Chasing Amy is honestly my favorite movie of all time. Kevin Smith wrote a tremendous script and the honesty with which the actors portrayed their roles is unbelieveable. You actually feel for these characters at points in the film! I have since seen every Kevin Smith movie but none of them, in my opinion, compare to this one. This movie explores the one thing that we all have issues with...LOVE, Smith touches on the subject with the right amount of comedy and drama. The one let down with this movie is that a soundtrack was never made available(the only movie of Smith's that this problem occurs with)! This movie will make you laugh, it may make you cry, and it will definitely teach you about love!
