If you think you've seen enough French films that suggest they are not for you then this film won't make you change your mind one iota. Although it's Polish written and directed, it takes on all the pretensions of French cinema which is *usually* dull, and over bearing with artistic self-indulgence. It's devoid of all realism, acted by women that look like they came straight from a L'Oreal make-up commercial (Binoche is mesmerising if you like the china doll acting), acted by wimpy corduroy wearing men, pointless shagging (no nakedness here, must be the Polish Catholic background), and self consciously "artistic".

The worst thing I can remember was that it was supposed to be about a composer who had written beautiful music, but even the music was dull and too OTT. One of the sub-plots involving the stripper was laughable and when you really would appreciate some real emotion involving Binoche actually acting (messy and weepy and a bit more drama generally!), then it was back to the same old dreamy close-ups.

It's not that I came to the movie with a closed mind, I wanted to see a decent French movie - the ones everyone raves about. In my humble opinion this just isn't it.
