I saw the movie Stargate but never watched SG-1.  I was missing my dose of Sci Fi.  I still miss Babylon 5 and the Trek series (not enterprise).  SGA is a welcome addition to my library.

Season 2
DVD Set:
1.  The discs are great and easy to take them out.
2.  Slim type case gives extra room, not like the Buffy, Babylon 5, Lois & Clark to name a few that take a lot of space.
3.  THERE ARE SCENE SELECTIONS ON THIS SET.  Thank you for that... I hated that season 1 did not have them.
4.  All episodes come with a commmentary, excellent.. you can watch it with or without giving you double the pleasure.
5.  The menu is much better than in season one.  It is easy to read and navigate.
6.  The art on the cases and DVD is OK, nothing fancy but it does not look like a bad print like in the Beauty and the Beast series.

THE SERIES.

Like other reviewers I will agree that the cast is much better in season two.  I did not like the character played by Rainbow Sun and I still not care for Ronan.  All the other characters are great.  The deadelus and its captian are a welcomed addition to the series, giving in it a great sense of power in the pegasus galaxy.

All the episodes are great and built momentum, but the final three episodes including the finale are lacking the excitement of season one.  The final episode ends with a cliffhanger, that does not (at least to this reviewer) make you sit on the edge of your seat waiting for season three to star.  Through the season we watched conflicts within the crew, friends and enemies to be let down at the end.

It is still an excellent show, highly recommended to add to any sci fi library.  If you do not have any of the four seasons, buy them in the pack (I did), and at the time was cheaper than individually.

Sit down and enjoy the show.
