Both Pacino and De Palma make another masterpiece. Reuniting after Scarface pays off for the actor-director combination.

Its about an ex-drug dealer, or at least thats how Carlito sees himself. After getting out of jail the drug dealer decides that he wants to change his life and become clean. However he can't leave behind his old druggie friends and stays in the buisness looped in a catch-22. He can't get away from drugs and killing, no matter how hard he tries. It seems that everyone else around him are what he is trying to escape from, but either he can't see or doesn't want to leave it, and soon the cops believe his is involved in drug deals and murder. As he flees from people trying to kill him, he tries to escape the city with his woman, only to come to a gut-retching end that really comes out of nowhere.

The ending left me pissed off, if you've seen this movie than you know why. I would definately suggest this movie to anyone who enjoys a good movie. Pacino does it again by convincing you that he is Carlito, and solidifies his position as one of the best actors of all time.
