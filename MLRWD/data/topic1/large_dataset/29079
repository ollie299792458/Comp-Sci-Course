I personally found this movie to be an excellent watch. It is about a baseball pitcher in his ending career, pitching his final game. As he plays through this game, he flashes back on memories, moments, and mostly how the love of his life has impacted him. After the feeling that he has lost everything he has ever loved because of his career ending, he realizes he loves something even more. For love of the game is a movie that can reach out and personally touch specific crowds of people. This movie gets to me because I am an athlete and know how it feels to have the game quit you.

While watching this movie the flashbacks are something I believe a majority of people can relate to. That makes this movie significant because we can all peel back our layers and compare them to Billy as he views the years. You witness struggle, love, desperation, heartbreak and a number of other emotions while viewing this movie. Hopefully the memories Billy goes through will remind you of yours, such as falling in love.

This movie can take a person back to when baseball was good, when playing the game was all that mattered. Money, the jersey you wore, none of that matters in this movie. You only played: For love of the Game.

Apologies for the lack of review, but this movie is magical and I would not want to spoil any of it.
