To paraphrase Terry Pratchett, "Grind up the entire Universe and pass it through the finest sieve: you'll find no trace of respect, or compassion, or honour." Humans made up those lovely ideas; humans live for those ideas; humans die for those ideas.

Magic? Unicorns? Santa Claus? They don't exist in the physical world either. But entertaining the possibility of the 'little' fantasies is the first step in belief of the big fantasies: duty, courage, integrity. Humans need to believe in the big fantasies to become human. On the day that an ape stood beside her mate to chase away a leopard threatening their children, not as a matter of hard-wired instinct but as an altruistic decision to protect her family, that was the day that a human first walked on this planet.

"Stardust" is a fantastical tale. An ordinary boy, with not-so-ordinary hidden qualities, becomes enmeshed in a situation where he must overcome lifelong assumptions about how the world works. The boy meets the embodiment of a star... a celestial watcher crashed to earth. The rare presence of this beautiful avatar awakens the foul lust of an evil witch who wants to rip out the star's heart and eat it to gain prolonged life. The boy also has a use for the star: she will be a gift to an indifferent village girl who has toyed with the boy.

A parallel story line involves the succession of the ruler of the magical kingdom and the search for a jewel. The fact that the star has the jewel on her person brings the two threads of the story together. The story-arc of callow youth to manhood, good defeating evil, bravery rewarded is ancient. The reason that such a tale is continually retold is simple: we WANT to see ourselves in such a narrative. We want to believe that somewhere inside us is the spark that can kindle to a flame of right-thinking and right actions.

We want to believe that, when the time comes, we will do the right thing.
