Fandango is a coming of age movie set in Texas (Austin), in 1971. The main problem with the movie is the song "Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting". That song didn't come out until 1973...but other than that, it's a terrific movie.

The "Groovers" are graduating from college (not all of them) and a couple of them have been drafted into service for the Vietnam War. So, they decide to take a road trip...their final road trip as the "Groovers".

The scenery in this movie leaves a lot to be desired, but that's not the focus of the movie. The focus of the movie is growing up into responsible adults after leading lives of fun loving, irresponsible young people. They realize that their lives are changing and the change is frightening.

One of the main charaters dated the fiance of one of the other main characters and there are some flashback/dreamlike sequences with "The Girl". The girl is Suzie Amis. Without this story arc, the movie doesn't have much of a purpose. It deepens the characters and gives them a past.

The movie starts to drag just a tad, but then, the movie savior of all the movie saviors appears on screen...Truman Sparks. The whole skydiving scene was the catalyst for making this movie. After the Truman Sparks experience the movie takes on a more direct path.

I left a lot of things out on purpose. It might seem like the typical coming of age movie, at first glance. But, do yourself a favor and give it more than a glance. If you visit IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes, you'll find low viewer ratings for this movie. Maybe they didn't give it the chance it deserves. Watch it and rate it for yourself. You won't be disappointed.
