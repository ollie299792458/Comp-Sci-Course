The lessons in this movie are simply too many to list: overcoming adversity and making no excuses, competing gracefully and cheering when your opponent does well, opening up to people who may be of a background different than yours, getting back on your feet after a setback, the importance of a community supporting a cause, etc.

This movie is 100% positive. There is no vindictiveness or spitefulness. I don't think I have seen a movie before where EVERY character becomes a better person.

Laurence Fishburne has one of the most commanding presences of any actor. Whenever he is not on screen you are just anxious for him to return. His role as the professor is so overwhelming it probably is what gives stature to the whole  movie. Well also, Keke Palmer, the girl who plays Akeelah is enchanting too.

This movie is the antidote to African American and Hispanic children being told that they cannot score well because of the "cultural bias" in standardized tests. At a time when demagogues make careers of insisting that African American children be taught in ebonics and Hispanic children in "bilingual" programs, this movie teaches: "this is YOUR language; master its' power and a whole universe will open for you". It is also refreshing to break the stereotypes and see African Americans cheering for things other than what movies typically show (music, sports).

Can't say much more that probably hasn't been said already. Unlike what most other reviewers claim, there was a twist as to who wins at the end which I didn't see coming, and made the movie even more enjoyable (now, I shouldn't tell you more about it, should I?). It could be I'm just naive.

Absolutely loved it.
