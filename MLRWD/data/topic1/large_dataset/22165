Str Trk 4 : Whales

The crew of the innrprize are on sporks planet and they hear that there is this big piece of poo in space that is headed to earth and is going to blow it up a lot. this is like vag'na from the first movie but instead of a mind melt they need whales. Spork is still out of it and is wearing a bathrobe and they all decide that they are going to hang a u-turn around the sun to go back in time to 1980s where there are lots of whales cause there aren't any humpbacks in the future. THIS WORKS! They end up in San Fran and land their invisible plane in the park and someone sees them and is all like "WHAAAAA" but he's a bum so noone will believe him. they hang out in San Fran for awhile and spork makes a headband so he's all like Rambo now and kills a punk rocker on the bus cause his music is TOO LOUD! Kork flirts with this 80s chick and Scotchy speaks into a mouse and then everyone is freaked out that Checkoff is a russian. Spork swims with the whales and then they go back to the future and the big thing is like "FINE!" and then it leaves.
