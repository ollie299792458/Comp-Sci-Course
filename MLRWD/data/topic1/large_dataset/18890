I thought this PPV would overall be great, I was pretty disappointed by a lot of the matches.Whatever here are my opinions.
PPV Intro - Wow WWE is always the best in making these kind of videos.
Dudley Boyz v. Batista and Flair (World Tag Titles Table Match) : You think this would be a good match considering being in PHilly, ECW land and being a tables match with such awesome talent. But it was really bad.
John Cena self-promo ft. RVD - Nice...
Rey Mysterio v. Jamie Knoble (WWE Cruiserweight title match) : I was really looking forward to this match but it was a waste of 3 minutes. Plus the storyline with Nidia did not climax, it happened on the next Smackdown! which makes no sense, why didn't they just put it here?Whatever.
Eddie Guerrero v. Chavo Guerrero : Another match that I was extremely looking forward to. Slow-paced match not that good actually.
Hardcore Holly v. Brock Lesnar (WWE title) ; I still have trouble believing that Sparkplug Bob Holly was maineventing Smackdown! for more than a month. Anyways I thought the storyline itself was pretty good. But the match was another waste. Sudden F-5, over, crowd pretty pleased with that too actually.
HBk v. HHH (World Title Last Man Standing Match): Their match on DEcember,30th,2003 in San Antonio was so much better, this was bloody and had its moments but also not that good. People disliked the finish but it made sense for the characters roles.
Goldberg meets Lesnar Backstage II
Eric Bischoff say hello to Paul Heyman: I loved this segment.
the 2004 Royal Rumble: incredibly predictable but I still loved every moment of it. Amazing sixty minutes.
