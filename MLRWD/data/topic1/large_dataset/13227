I was disappointed by this movie because I was expecting something more along the lines of The Road.  Instead, what I got was I Am Legend meets Mad Max.

The performances were stellar, of course.  Denzel Washington plays a convincing anti-hero, and Gary Oldman plays yet another unforgettable villain.  Seriously, I can still picture him in my mind.  Also, some of the scenes were beautifully photographed.

But overall, the script put me off.  Post-apocalypse type movies and books attract me because they are typically thought-provoking.  What would the world be like if some huge disaster were to befall us?  How would people survive?

In this genre, my suspension of disbelief is limited.  But your suspension has to be pretty high to watch this thing.  It's fine in a Bruce Lee movie when six guys get dispatched by a single swordsman, even if it looks choreographed and cheesy.  Here, however, it makes no sense.  It just makes the writer look lazy and unimaginative.

This movie is entertaining, but nothing special.
