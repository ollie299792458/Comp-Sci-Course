Okay, so its another sci-fi action with a female lead.  These sci-fis tend to fizzle at the box office (see Cat Woman, Elektra and Underworld).  The only ones in recent memory that cracked the $100 million mark is Angelina's Tomb Raider 1 & 2.  But that came with a set audience.  The game was accessible, far more so than the original MTV Aeon Flux animated series, which had only built up a cult following.

Translating something so dark and alternative was always going to be a challenge.  Not going the black vinyl and leather look of The Matrix and perpetual rain and gloom of Bladerunner, The Crow and any Batman was a welcome change.

Sure, it took a while to get into the story and the plot was only revealed half way through but at the end everything falls into place.  I have not seen the original Aeon Flux MTV series, just snippets and what I have seen reminds me a lot of The Animatrix and 2000 AD.

But if you're an original Aeon Flux fan, then give this movie a chance.  Understand that in most Hollywood quarters the bottom line in profits and returns is what counts and some producers have to toe the line if they want a movie made. (Hence Bladerunner's watered down ending).

So, in this version of Aeon Flux the producers have had to find a medium between being faithful to the source and at the same time being accessible to the general public.

The budget was not huge and there was minimal CGI but the action sequences were excellent.  Although there should have been more.

Charlize should stand above the other female action leads.  This is better than Elektra, Catwoman and Underworld.  I enjoyed Underworld and hey, Kate Beckinsale in skintight leathers is hot, but the doom and gloom (which seems to be a constant in any vampire/werewolf movie) was just too much.

All in all, Aeon Flux was more hit than miss.
