Before having watched this film I never really had much of an idea of who Chopper was and i was interested in seeing the film from all the little things id heard, but I have got to say I never expected to get as much out of the film as I did. Chopper is dimentionally entertaining and opened me up to this whole new world of the once psycho Mark Chopper Reid.

Andrew Dominik tells the story in a very new and interesting way, the film is very conversational and seems to highlight only the most substantial moments in Reids life. Through many outstanding performances the film is made very realistic and is as if your standing right there watching it.

Now i've got to add credit to Eric Bana for his performance in the film, It is absolutely incredible in my opinion, one of the best performances to date. When you watch it its as if he has just shapeshifted himself magically to mould another person, he is nothing alike to the person that he is in real life its awesome. Its a no wonder after him doing this film he has never had to do another audition for other films. BRILLIANT!

This film along with comedy, drama and the true story telling side of it, is accually realistically bloody so it aint for the faint hearted but nether the less the movie is great and most will enjoy it. Ive watched it three times since i purchased it just last week. The films only flaw i felt was i didnt feel i knew enough of what there is to know about the character, but i would guess that would have something to do with a lesser budget that the film had, but anyways the film is great and i grant it five thumbs up and recommend it to you. Enjoy!
