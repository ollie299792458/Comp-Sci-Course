Die Hard defined the concept of tension, with McClane trapped in a building, maybe in elevator shafts, trying to kill the terrorists, save his wife, and destroy the building. Die Hard 2 started the mayhem all over again, as McClane found himself up against terrorists trying to rescue a drug kingpin, taking over Dulles International Airport, grounding all airplanes and leaving them trapped in the air and running out of fuel, AND screwing the passengers up in the process. Die Hard with A Vengeance showed Hans Gruber (the terrorist leader in the original)'s brother up for revenge. Him and his terrorists place bombs throughout the city of NYC to cover up a massive heist, worth all the gold in the Federal Reserve, and trick McClane into thinking it's an act of revenge. Overall the series is wildly entertaining, but it's made even better by this explosive giftset. Great audio commentaries, behind-the-scenes footage, slideshows, trailers, TV commercials, etc., all make this one of the better giftsets out there. Buy it if you want RAW action.
