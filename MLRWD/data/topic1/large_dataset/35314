This was the first Alfred Hitchcock movie I have seen and I enjoyed it very much.  I thought it was interesting the way he made opposites attract with James Stewart's character, Jefferies, and Grace Kelly's character, Lisa.  Jefferies was the type of person who like adventure.  He would be gone for days on trips and wouldn't get to take a bath, that was until he broke his leg.  Lisa, on the other hand, was a glamorous and polite uptown lady who always wanted things her way.  She tried to persuade Jefferies that they were meant for each other until she got caught up in all of the commotion of a suspected crime in the apartment building across the courtyard. Since Jefferies was stuck in a wheelchair, Lisa became his legs.  She went to the apartment building and got the name off of the mailbox.  She also went into Mr. Thorwald's apartment and took his wife's wedding ring.  When Mr. Thorwald got home and found her in the bedroom, he backed her into the living room with her back facing the window.  She pointed out to Jefferies that she had the ring, but she didn't mean that she only had the ring.  She also meant that she was ready to get married.  I really liked the end.  Lisa was laying on the couch reading a book and a magazine dresssed in pants, a shirt and a rag in her hair.  Jefferies was asleep in the wheelchair with two braken legs instead of one.
