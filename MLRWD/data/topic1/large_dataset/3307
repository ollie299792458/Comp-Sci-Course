The movie was first class. I cannot fault either of the two movies I have watched in this trilogy. I have not yet watched the final DVD. (I purchased the first DVD from a local shop here in Brisbane)
My only gripe is the condition of the disc itself. When I commenced to watch it, it showed a number of previews of upcoming movies. Which is fair enough I suppose. But what happened with this particular disc, was that it kept showing the previews over and over, repeatedly.
At first I thought the entire DVD was a faulty one filled with previews.It was not until I slowly trawled through the disc, and got to where the actual movie began. This is the very first time I have ever encountered this problem, and I have over 400 movies, collected through the years. I have always owned movies instead of renting them.
Which is why I love shopping at Amazon, and will continue to do so

Thank you very much
