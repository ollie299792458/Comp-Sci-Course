If you lived in the eighties or are a computer nerd, you'll like this movie.  I like this movie for two reasons; the nostalgia and the acting.  I grew up around computers and remember going to my dad's workplace in the eighties that had big computers that took up entire rooms, such as the ones in WarGames.  As a computer nerd, it brings back memories of the earlier computers.
If you're not a computer nerd, you may not appreciate this movie so much.  The movie shows a young Matthew Broderick (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Friends) as a high school student with a big interest in computers.  While trying to connect to a computer company's mainframe, he instead stumbled upon a government computer.  
With curiousity as his motivation, he learned everything he could in order to crack the code and gain access.  Once he cracks the code, he tinkers around, thinking that he was just playing a game.  However, he sparked a DEFCON 2 in NORAD and sent the military scrambling.
He must make the computer learn that there is no winner in war.  It also gives viewers a small glimpse of how easy it was to be a hacker back in the day.  I gave this three stars because it's not the best movie that i've ever seen.  However, it is worth adding to your video collection. The story line is good, the acting is good and offers some nostalgia.
