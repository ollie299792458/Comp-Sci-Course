I'll start by saying that this is the first installment of a series of direct-to-dvd hellboy releases. Well, at least that's what they say in the booklet. Also, this story seems to be loosely based off one of the hellboy comics (you all remember the flying heads, right?). The last thing you have to know is this is officially NON-CANON. Mignola (though involved) wanted this project to be differentiated from *his* hellboy, hence the more-traditional cartoon style. The big upside to this is all the actors from the hellboy movie (ron perlman, selma blair, et al.) do the voices for their characters in the film. The downside is the story didn't translate into an hour-long show very well, so its kinda plodding and dull in places. I still recommend it though, especially if you can get your hands on one of the versions that came packaged with a small graphic novel (also non-canon, but fun). I got mine at wally world with said novel, which is the only reason i justified the expense. Not to say the movie wasn't worth the money on its own, just couldn't pass up the extra content. anyways, yeah. thumbs up.
