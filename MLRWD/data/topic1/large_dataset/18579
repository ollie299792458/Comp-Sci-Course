This movie was the greatest movie ever!!! The only flaw was that it didnt have any Saiyian Donkeys that could go to Super saiyan 4!
Speaking of the super sayian, Broy was born a super saiyan and was senticed to death. It was the day that Freaza blew up the Saiyans. Broy used his super sayian migth and surrvied the blast. This movie is true because this movie culd've happoned during the ten days they had to  train to fight the  Cell. when Goku and vegeta train under not normal gravity, they become so much stronger. So it wuld make so much sense to train in outerspace. For example, Goku went Super Saiyan on  Namek and tranied under 100 times normal gravity. Vegeta tranied under 400 times normal gravity and went SS on the moon. And Gohan went SS in the time chamber which was above normal gravity. Future Trunks was the only Saiyan besides Goten to gain SS form in normal gravity.
Vegeta, the most confidenc, proud and the prince of all sayians turned Chiken om Broly. Piccolo, gohan, Trunks and Goku,standed no chance of beating Broly but fought any way. I can't belive Paragus wanted a coward fighter like Vegeta to rule the new planet vegeta.
