This is more of a reaction to the reviews of _Quills_ than a review itself.  I found them mostly true to the spirit of the film and its themes of hypocrisy, repression, and perverse censorship--how can we know unless we read, unless we see.  While I don't recommend that young children see such a film, for they are unequipped to understand its powerful images, I am most disappointed (but not surprised) by the superficial and ill informed evaluation of the film emanating from the Lone Star state, where I now teach film, writing and literature.  The review is unsigned for good reason.  I would not put my name nor a recognizable alias to such a weak ad hominem attack either.
Just so, the review is valuable.  It represents a certain sensibility with which teachers struggle daily and by which society continues to be strangled. _Quills_ and works like it are supremely threatening to people with small minds and insufficient understanding. But just as _Quills_ should not be censored, neither should those who fail to understand it.  It is better to know what one is up against than to be blissfully ignorant and thus unprepared.
