SERPICO, is one of my favorite movies of all times. I love everything about this film especially Al Pacino who gives the performance of a lifetime. Pacino was so convinving as undercover cop Frank Serpico that it is scary. This film defined the way police corruption is looked upon in the eyes of everyday policemen and it also became one of the first films in the 1970's to explore the antihero in its most complex form. This movie was s smash hit at the box office in 1973, when it was release and it was nominated for I believe five Academy Awards including Best Picure of the year and the Best Actor for Al Pacino, sadly enough neither the film or the actor won the coveted award. A lot of people say that it was The Godfather that Pacino proved that he was a great actor and even though in The Godfather he did an excellent job as Michael Corleone, it was in SERPICO, that I feel he was at his very best. He did follow with other great films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and BOBBY DEERFILED and he was brilliant in both but it was after watching SERPICO for the first time that I became aware of Pacino's brilliant acting talent. This film is a MUST if you care about excellence in acting or if you just one to see a great movie.  I highly recommend the book in which the film is based on it is also excellent. You should read the book first and then see the movie to get a better understanding of everthing that the character goes thru but either way if you see the film first and read the book after is no biggie. Both the film and book are excellent and I highly recommend both, nothing short of brilliant on all counts.
