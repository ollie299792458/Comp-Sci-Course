I rented and viewed "The Day After Tomorrow" recently.

I was bored throughout and would have simply turned it off and hit "rewind", had I not paid to see the movie.

I had read nothing but negative reviews of "The Day After Tomorrow" and had rented it with the intention of setting straight those who were so critical of a movie depicting the nightmare worst case scenario of global warming--something I consider to be a real possibility.

Sadly, I must now join the chorus of critics of Roland Emmerich's latest cliche-ridden disaster flick.

The film is characterized by a suffocating concoction of dauntless American heroism and sappy traditional home and family values rubbed into the viewer's nose ad nauseum--a reflection, no doubt, of the mood now prevalent in this nation.

There is also excessive Hollywood style special effect sock, bang and pow noise and violence where a thoughtful examination of the very real issue of global warming might have been more helpful.

Additionally, as per Hollywood's stock in trade formula, inordinately intelligent African Americans spout endless profundities, while no Native American, Hispanic or Arab American says or does anything noteworthy.

There is even a quasi-supernatural demonization of escaped zoo wolves at one point to further annoy the thoughtful viewer.

And a child-like PG 13 rendition of a sanitized hand-holding romance between two brainy students is as near as the movie comes to anything romantic.

Global warming is a serious and pressing problem for the human species--one made more so by the Bush administration's refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol.

But Emmerich's "The Day After Tomorrow"--a movie that could have been a great teaching tool--so trivializes the issue that the cause of enlightenment about the perils of global warming may have been done more harm than good.

I was very disappointed by "The Day After Tomorrow".
