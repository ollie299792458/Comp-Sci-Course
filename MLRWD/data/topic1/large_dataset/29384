I have only seen Rage live once (Lollapalooza 93) and apparently that was all I was intended to see of this explosive act seeing as every time I had tickets for another gig it was cancelled (93 club tour and the Rhyme and Reason tour).  That makes these shows on DVD all the more essential for those of you who never got to see Rage live.  
Before Lollapalooza I had never heard of them.  The day after I bought the CD and wore it out.  Never has a band put out such solid albums as Rage, each one diverse but focused, pounding their political message into your head with every heavy beat and power chord.
This DVD (most of which aired on MTV after the release of 'The Battle of Los Angeles') encapsulates the live Rage experience but ultimately forshadows the demise of this great band.  At points Zack seems tired and listless, simply saying the lyrics instead of screaming them like the demon-poet of the past.  And the unfortunate addition of some hokey video effects (slow motion, delay) really reminds you that this is video and not just a straight live performance.  
Those points aside - The Battle of Mexico City is a strong performance from an amazing band.  Tom Morello and Timmy C thrash through each song with reckless abandon, sweat spilling from every pour from start to finish.  And the addition of the documentary footage on the Zapatistas narrated by Zack is important in keeping with Rage's committment to the underdog and overall very interesting and informative.
We can only hope that Rage continues to release DVD's of old shows (particularly the Democratic Convention show) so that new fans and old can see what this band was all about live.  
I don't think they will be the same (live) with another lead singer.  This marks the end of an era.
