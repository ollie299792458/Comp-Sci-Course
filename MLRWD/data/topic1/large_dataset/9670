Fried Green Tomatoes is truly a beautiful movie.  The senses  are flooded with superior video and sound, the characters are compelling through excellent acting, and the heart is warmed through the wonderful story.  Although many of the unpleasant traits of human beings are in evidence, notably racism, these scenes are done in a manner that is counterbalanced and overshadowed by the positive human characteristics and relationships that dominate the film.

Fried Green Tomatoes seeks, and draws out, the best qualities in people; and viewers can not only discern and identify with the characters, they can identify with the emotions inside them that make them beautiful.  It is a film about loving and giving with touches of sadness and true human comedy in between.

Mary Stuart Masterson "makes" the film and compliments the superb acting of her fellow cast members.  But none of this could have happened without the superior directing of Jon Avnet who illustrates and paints this story and then saturates our senses with every aspect of this beautiful film.
