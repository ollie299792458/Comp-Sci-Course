This movie isn't for everyone.  It's decent enough.  Fans of Simon Pegg won't be disappointed.  Other people may wonder why so many people like him.  But I don't want to focus on the movie itself.  I want to review the DVD.

The American release of "How to Lose Friends..." contains NO extras worth mentioning.  Simon Pegg and his collaborators put together a huge collection of extras to be included on the DVD, because they feel fans deserve them.  Especially since the movie didn't do very well at the box office.

Commentaries, trivia, "plot hole" games... all were ready to be included.  But the studio is not including them on our version here.  Why?  They point the finger back at the people who made the extras, but only provide vague generalities of "they never gave them to us."

If you can, try finding a region-free player and order the UK version when it comes out.  That edition will have all the extras.

I also noticed that the UK has a Blu Ray coming out at the same time, but I don't see a Blu Ray release scheduled for here yet.

So, decent movie, but without the extras we're meant to see, what's the point?
