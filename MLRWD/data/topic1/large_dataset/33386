The presentation of Toy Story on this dvd is much better,with all new enhanced up to date sound and picture quality.

It also has wonderful bonus features including "The Making Of Toy Story",which is the first ever Toy Story making of featurete,which explains how they thought up all the charectors including Woody and Buzz!

The plot of this film is awesome,with a touch of friendship lesson in it!The movie is about a cowboy doll named Woody.When his owner Andy gets a new toy called Buzz Lightyear for his birthday,Woody is jeaules because he is no longer the center of attention with Andy.When Woody purposely knocks Buzz out the window,Woody goes after him because all the toys are mad at him,because they all thought Buzz was extremly cool!When Woody does find Buzz in Andy`s mom`s car,Buzz attacks him.When Woody and Buzz become lost toys at a gas store,they`re lead on the adventure of a life-time,and at the end,they become best friends for a lifetime!
