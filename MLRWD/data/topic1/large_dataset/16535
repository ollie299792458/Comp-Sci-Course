I knew James Dean was a tremendous actor when I saw him in "Rebel Without A Cause" and "Giant," but the depth of his abilities is most obviously showcased in the classic "East of Eden."  This film is a modern retelling of the Biblical tale of Cain and Abel.  Two brothers, one good and one bad, vie for the love of their father.  Dean portrays Cal Trask, the rebellious loner sternly rejected by the father who adores Cal's twin, the clean-cut model son Aron.  The age-old story of sibling rivalry achieves new dimension through the brilliant direction of Elia Kazan who intended the "evil" brother to the more appealing one.  Dean's anithero is indeed appealing, in scene after scene of his amazing big screen debut.  Whether sabatoging his father's newly-purchased ice house or in his heart-wrenching pleas for love, his emotional performance as the black sheep of the family makes it clear why James Dean will forever be America's legendary rebellious teen.  The rest of the cast is exceptional:  Raymond Massey as the father, Julie Harris as the ideal girl who loves both brothers, Richard Davolos as the good brother, Burl Ives as the family friend, and Jo Van Fleet in her brief but Academy-award-winning performance as the mother.
Based on the book by John Steinbeck, the title comes from the Book of Genesis where we are told that after killing his brother, Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
