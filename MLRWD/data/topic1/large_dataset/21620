I am a huge fan of Emergency and would, to this day, drop everything for a date with Randolph Mantooth! I have all four seasons so far. Yes, I do wish they would add extras (like the making of...I seem to remember reading that KT and RM did their own stunts and had to fight the studio to get paid extra for it? Extra being about $1500 a week.). And I can't wait for them to start releasing the Emergency movies.

My only complaint with Season 4 is the sound quality. I did not notice this problem in the earlier seasons but with Season 4 the sound seems all over the place. I watched about 6 shows (from several of the DVDs) with the volume high enough that I could hear the dialogue but when the sirens go off (either as they head to a call or from the call to the hospital), the siren sound is so bad (both in decibels and quality) that I have to turn down the volume about 8 or 10 notches. Plus there are a few other places in the DVD where the normal volume is too low and I have to turn it up 8 or 10 notches to hear the dialogue. If overall, the sound was low requiring you to turn up the volume, that is one thing. But to have the sound differ so much means I have to keep the volume remote in my hand at all times else my neighbors might think there are real fire trucks and such nearby!

It would be nice if the studios spent a little more time on these DVDs rather than just transfering them as is.
