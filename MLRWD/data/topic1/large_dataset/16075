Putting aside Greenpeace and political views, this was a good movie that adults can watch together with their children.  Sex and profanity is non-existent.  The story lacks slightly in parts, however overall if you are looking for clean entertainment for the evening, you can't go wrong with this one. There are several places where discussions could be opened up for families to impress upon their children redeeming values.

I liked the fact that this was based on a true event, and while I was more than old enough at the time of the actual occurance, I had actually never heard of this story before.  This made the story all the more interesting for me as I was able to watch it unfold for the first time.

There are quite a few well known actors/actresses in this movie, but the native Inuit's really steal the show.  The grandfather/grandson team was excellent as were the main male/female reporters.

*SPOILER ALERT*
Those of you with sensitive children who might be saddened by the death of the baby whale should take note that only the parent whales survive the situation.
