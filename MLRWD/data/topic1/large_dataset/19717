What? like you never thought of that joke...
I've always thought that this was a very underrated movie.
In all fairness, Its props and costumes are quite accurate.A lot of small details that are often overlooked in other war movies, are actual plot devices in this movie.A really clever movie that has done its home work.
The best part is the smooth performances of the stars in this movie.There isnt the over the top stuff that often happens in multi-star productions( towering inferno,earthquake, just about any of the multi-star epics of the 70's will work.).There isnt any of the typical,trying to out-perform the other guy stuff. All the characters have a reality to them that transcends the actor performing the character.When I watch Kellys Heros,I dont see Clint,Telly, Don and Donald or Harry Dean, I see the guys they are in the movie.Sort of a zen movie moment.  If you take a second and consider how chaoic the movie must have been to make,you realize what a real gem this movie is.It really is too bad they couldnt put some behind the scenes stuff on this.The back stage stories must have been great.
I have a buddy who descibes this movie as King Rat meets Patton.
But even that doesn't do it justice.I mean how many WW 2 comedies are there that take place on the front line? Most of the comedies that depict this time, take place in the rear, with the gear.Kellys Heros was such a good idea that they used it for the George Cloony vehicle,"Three kings".Kellys Heros is still a better movie by a long shot.
I have always thought that this movie is underrated.Maybe because it didnt take itself completely serious that it wasnt taken seriously.But whatever,Kellys Heros is a movie that deserves a closer look.
They always say comedy is hard.The story and perfomances in Kellys Heros takes comedy,and blends it with gunfire and death,and still manages to work.Really pretty amazing.
