The reason this is even getting a two is because of the music. I would rather my child hear this music on a CD as she's running around doing her thing than watch this video. Did you ever go into a gift shop and see those little gadgets with a  dolphin on one end and a weight on the other and when you tap it ot swings back and forth? Mixing this with the sound of Mozart is a clever idea to stimulate children. So go out and purchase the gadget for your child to view up close and personal and see the mechanics and want to touch and explore it on their own, not spend $17 on a DVD for your child to see it on TV. Toys spinning around and mechanics swirling to the sound of Mozart is something you can set up in your own home and video tape yourself. You may find you can get a bit more creative than what is on this video. I understand parents feeling guilty placing their child infront of a TV for a half an hour, we all want to actually enjoy a cup of coffee and flip through a magazine once in a while, but may I suggest if you don't already have cable, purchase a video like Noggin's Miffy. This is a colorful, slow paced, half hour show with pleasant dialouge and songs for children to sing along with. I really feel, unfortunately, that Baby Einstein Mozart is overrated.
