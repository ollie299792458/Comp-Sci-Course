This a singular Anderson achievement which outdistances his unique body of prior work both by stepping more out into the real world.  The characters and music merge seamlessly with a plot on the surface humorous and entertaining but on reflection thought provoking as well--one of the few movies I have seen in a long time that I have thought about for a long time afterwards and actually look forward to seeing again.  There are really two movies going on at once.  On first viewing, you see the outward moving by focusing on the story and action of the main players; but behind that, as is true of all Anerson films, there is a literally a background plot most of which is missed unless you ignore what is going on in front in order to see behind.  The movie has its strange points, Suzy with the bloody scissors after fending off the scout attackers and Sam's nonchalant reply that it was either them or us, the lighting hit on Sam near the end, and the chaotic final scenes when the storm hits.  I think one of the most poignant moments is when Willis agrees to adopt Sam to save him from Social Services and before agreeing Sam looks to Suzy for her approval--a look that speaks volumes of the depth of their relationship.  A superb cast all around but in my view Suzy steals the show.  Best move I've seen as long as I can remember.
