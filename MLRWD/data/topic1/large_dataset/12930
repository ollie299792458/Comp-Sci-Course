The main reason I got this blu-ray is because we recently got a new TV and I wanted a nature documentary to give the TV a test run (because we all know how amazing nature looks!).  I'm not too savvy on nature documentaries in the first place, so I'm mainly writing this review from my personal experience with the movie.  Like other people have said, this does get VERY depressing at times but I expect that out of any nature documentary because life, while beautiful, is cruel.  Also, I was expecting it to be much more graphic then it was just based on my personal experience with any documentary that has animals in it.  While animals did die, they did a good job of cutting off the scene before it got bloody and gross.  Overall, I thought the hunting aspect of the film was done in a very "clean" way, and that saved me from a bunch of embarrassing weeping in front of my husband, who would have surely just rolled his eyes at me.

Oddly, the only thing that really made me cry was how beautiful the time lapse scenes were (and there was quite a few).  Seeing blooming flowers, melting ice, and satellite images of the changes of the Earth over time was really something else and made me want to get more of Disneynature's films to hopefully stop my heart like Earth did.  I had never seen any of the birds of paradise, and was floored at the small section devoted to them.  It made me laugh, and shocked me that these creatures are even out there.

The animal scenes were sad at times, but I thought the movie ended and left me feeling good.  You get to see what they go through just to survive, and have been going through for years and years.  Nature is just so sad and yet so awesome.  It's hard to wrap your mind around the stuff that happens

Disneynature's Earth made me experience a bunch of different emotions, and to me that made the purchase worth it.
