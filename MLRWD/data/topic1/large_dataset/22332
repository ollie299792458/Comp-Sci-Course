I believe this is one of the most perfect films ever made. While appearing to be a simple "coming of age" story it reaches into the depths of human relationships; Mother and child, child and Mentor, Friends, Lovers, Priest and Parish, Idividuals to their community. All of these within the context of Movies, our fears and fantasies made visual. It is a story of courage and of cowardice, of monumental love and devastating loss, Enormous acts and emotions all contained in a small and somewhat insignificant village. This is the story of a community and how it shaped the life of one boy - and sent him out into the world. It is also a love story. And a director's gift of love to his audience [note* I urge you NOT to buy the director's cut of this film it is awful, the theatrical is perfection.]  The last moments of the film are soo touching that I found myself, like toto, laughing and crying at the same time. This film enriched my life, if by reminding me of all the wonderful people I have known and the times we spent together. A Classic film - don't miss it.
