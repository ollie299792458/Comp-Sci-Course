The self-discovery journey of one only learning to live when facing death is hardly undiscovered territory, but 'One Week' almost makes it seem fresh. The film is sentimental, to be sure, yet evades mawkishness through the quality of its writing (particularly the often witty narration perfectly voiced by Campbell Scott), its restrained performances (notably by lead Joshua Jackson who manages to give stoic blandness a quality both quietly heroic and quite appealing), and the magnificent beauty of the Canadian landscape. This is not a film that could have been churned out in the U.S. where pretension is often mistaken for art and imitation is the sincerest form of greed. Its artless humanity and understated touchingness (a step above pathos) have a distinctly Canadian flavor. It's the sort of film to enjoy in solitude on a 'hooky' day, a lazy weekday morning when you shirk your responsibilities for a couple of hours and succumb to your stifled emotions - not a guilty pleasure, just a very personal one. The closing lines of Tennyson's 'Ulysses' provide a fitting epigraph.
