Hi I'am just basically writing this review to all those other people who think Beyonce is a bad choice for this movie, yeah  right Beyonce is great, man she has accomplished so much and is still very young.  Like Come on guy's Beyonce is brillant in everything she does and will be brillant in this.  Now About the 'Fro,  So many had them back then they were hip, groovy, and wild.  Even from the previews  you can tell she won't have it in all the time.  In the last Austin Powers video the female side kick had terrible acting skills, but just don't think about it to much just like the plot.  There are many movies out there with bad acting but are still good movies, so even if you think Beyonce can't act (Even though I know She Won't let us down) just remember all the effort she has put fourth, and throw her a freakin' bone here alright.  Beyonce is a good rolemodel for alot of people and i'm sure will be a good actress.  Beyonce I love you you are great and don't let the haters bring ya down!
