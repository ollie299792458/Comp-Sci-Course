I wrote a rave review for the first season because of how incredible and sublimely perfect it was. I also pondered whether or not that kind of magic can be duplicated, and feared season 2 would have to be a letdown after a blockbuster first season.

I was so wrong. Season 2 blew season 1 out of the water. It was better in so many ways. Aaron Paul deserved the Emmy nomination because he was fantastic, Cranston once again was light years better than any performance you will see on tv. The editing, cinematography, music cues, scene location, and direction were just so perfectly blended. Everything about season 2 was great.

But it starts with the story, of course. And naturally youre left, after season 1's finale, wondering what direction the show is going to careen off into and carry a mesmerized audience. The conclusion of season 1 left us with a pretty good idea of what was going to happen, and then season 2 went break-neck speed further past that and well beyond. I was stunned at how beautiful and tragic some of the character developments evolved, such as the scene where Jesse's girlfriend dies, the scene just prior to where Walt is at the bar with (unknowingly) the girls father, and then the action Walt takes to save Jesse from his despair. Its madness and yet its so touching. Definitely one of my favorite sequences.

Or the scene where Tuco has Jesse at gunpoint and Jesse mans up and truly breaks bad by actually overpowering the lunatic Tuco. Real solid character development that had me howling for Jesse's triumph.

You can have your reality tv, your lame game shows, your crime dramas  your adult swim whatever. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING compares to this masterpiece. There has never been a show so engaging, thrilling and groundbreaking as this show, and you will never see a show like this as long as you live. Everything pales in comparison, so enjoy this ride while it lasts, because it seems to me Season 3 may just be the end.
