For the purpose of this review I will treat the two movies as one story.

Story: The movies follow the life of a ronin (masterless samurai) as he goes on his way meeting people, helping people with their problems in his own peculiar way all the while trying to make some money out of it. This is the source material for Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns w/ eastwood that gained so much popularity in the US.

The first story finds our protagonist essentially playing two warring factions against each other while he decides what he wants to accomplish with this game of chess. The second story follows Sanjuro as he assists a bumbling group of samurai in their quest.

Both movies are filled with tons of humor and sharp story telling.

Audio/Video: The movies are presented in widescreen and look pretty nice, the blacks are sharp and everything is clear. Music is a little meaty but such was the style back then and dialogue is clear.

Extras: The audio commentaries are highly informative and very interesting.

Great purchase for Kurosawa fans and those who want to see a funny story about the grouchiest samurai.
