i've read a number of reviews here, so i see no reason to rhapsodize about  a classic. but i will point out a couple of things: (1) the soldiers in  this movie are believable because they show us their FEAR. if you think  that's a banal statement take a closer look at (yup) Saving Private Ryan.  where's the fear? my point exactly; there's not a whole lot of it (besides  the opening 20 minutes where the troops are under DIRECT attack). not  enough for my taste. contrast this with malick's machismo-less The Thin Red  LIne.  fear is a common palpable theme running the ENTIRE movie. this makes  for some uncomfortable viewing, sports fans, but that's war. (2) malick is  the man to watch. do yourself a big favor and buy "Days of  Heaven" on DVD. and rent "Badlands." "Days of  Heaven" is a profound movie-watching experience that (like all classic  movies) IMPROVES WITH EACH VIEWING. i'm keeping this review short because i  want the people who gave The Thin Red Line 1 or 2 stars to keep reading all  the way to the end. you know how it is when you've got a short attention  span ...
