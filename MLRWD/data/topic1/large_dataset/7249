Friends, I have watched this movie five times and find myself enjoying it more with each viewing.  My very first reaction was that I thought it was better than the first "Pirates" movie.  Though it is a sequel, you do not need to have seen "Curse of the Black Pearl" to understand "Dead Man's Chest."  Which is one of the reasons I like this movie.  In my opinion, the only thing seeing "Curse of the Black Pearl" will do for you, is heighten your enjoyment of an already enjoyable movie.

There have been those who have complained about the length of this movie, about the abundant use of CGI (Computer Generated Images) and about the plot.  Well, let me just say this.  For a movie that is two and a half hours long, it does not feel like two and a half hours.  While the use of CGI is prevalent, it is believable and doesn't look like CGI.  As to the plot, I would say that it is in the spirit of an old sea tale.  Which, as you may know, do not depend on such trifle things as reality and believability to tell a good yarn.  And, by Jove!, this is a good yarn.

"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" is a most enjoyable film, that I would highly recommend.  It leaves you wanting more.  Which you will get, come summer '07.
