In a society where learning and responsibility are viewed as burdens, it is refreshing to encounter a heroine who likes learning, particularly about science.  You go, Barbie! Regarding a complaint about Barbie's not getting angry; is this really a bad thing?  Instead, she possesses a level of self-control that leads to a healthy and effective approach to problems. This movie presents a positive role model for youngsters (and oldsters) who watch it. Even though the computer imaging is a relatively new experience for me, I find the nuances of many of the moves pretty natural and graceful, and combined with the artwork (scenery, colors), the animation makes a pleasing viewing experience. This non-aggressive video is a positive shift from many of the aggressive characterizations that flood the market and negatively affect those who watch them. My favorite part is the "outtakes" at the end. Let go of literary hoity-toityism and just enjoy this production for what it is meant to be - a lighthearted KIDS fairy tale!
