There are few pairings that work quite well together, and undoubtedly in this instance, Luc Besson's usual flair for action coincides with Jet Li's martial arts skills.  Most of the "American" movies Jet Li had made had been lackluster at best.  They've tended to focus on his acting skills rather than his fighting skills.  Unfortunately in his movies "Romeo must Die" and even in "The One", his martial acrobatics are few and far between.  "Kiss of the Dragon" blends a balanced mixed of Jet Li's fighting as well as the suave yet sadistic acting by Tcheky Karyo, whose solid performance complements that of Jet Li's.  Seeing these two do battle blends into a menagerie of action sequences reminiscent of "La Femme Nikita" and "The Professional".  As with all great action stars, it is my hope that Jet Li continues to choose to surround himself with the best of Hollywood as he makes his foray into the American market.  "Kiss of the Dragon" was a great start.
