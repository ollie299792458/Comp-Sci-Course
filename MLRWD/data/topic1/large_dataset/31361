I don't understand how the previous reviewer gave this 1 star.  It seems that more and more people these days think horror is supposed to be an over the top gore and creature fest.  I live in San Jose and was lucky enough to see this film originally at Cinequest and believe me, there were plenty of people disturbed by the images that they saw.  I've never seen such a realistic portrayal of a gross anatomy lab and now I'm glad I never pursued the medical sciences.  Believe me, I'm a big fan of the horror genre and about 90% of the stuff seems to be more campy than creepy, but this movie is a keeper.  Especially if you know somebody going to med school.  I have a couple of friends who are in med school and I'd sure like their opinion of the gross anatomy lab.

This movie was part of the After Dark Horrorfest that I missed locally so I'm glad the whole collection is out on DVD.  Personally, I'm glad that there has been a revival of Horror films and I would encourage everyone to support these kinds of films because they are at the forefront of content (video games also) that is targeted when people look to place blame on all that ails society.  Am I being overly generous with my 5 star rating?  I think not.  I usually only give such ratings to movies that have genuinely moved me, made me change my perspective on a subject or teach me something new.  In this case I see autopsies and organ donation in a whole different light.
