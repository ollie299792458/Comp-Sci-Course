As you see the spagheti westerns are geting very popular nowdays. I think that this kind of story telling is very rearly shown on the sp. spoof,like FFDM,whitch is an other great example withe two great acters: CLINT EASTWOOD &amp; LEE VAN CLEEF.with similar story.I rememberd when i was 12 year old when my father showed me for the first time DEATH RIDES A HORSE on VHS.I felt in love with the movie,even though after is sew THE GOOD ,THE BAD AND THE UGLY,whitch is an other great SERGIO LEONE'S western.The film is classified as one of the best non-Leone SP- WEST with consistent story flow, superb sondtrack and good use of time element,mutch like Leone's sense of rythm.Vincenzoni did his best to apply Leone recipe for that film, and assigned many of Leone's crew members like:MARIO BREGA, LUIGI PISTILLI, JOSE TORES,ANTHONY DAWSON etc. LUCIANO VINCENZONI is the screenwrighter.One of the best screenwriters of the sp- genre. LUCIANO VINCENZONI was also the writer of SERGIO LEONE's two great westerns: For a few dollars more &amp; The Good The Bad &amp; The Ugly. DEATH RIDES A HORSE ,the director GIULIO PETRONI was supervised by VINCENZONI up on UA's directions. What i can sagest is that the copy of DEATH RIDES A HORSE on DVD is of poor print ,it should be  sheame when you compere with the other LEONE'S westerns on DVD ,when you look at there quality. I can count if the studio re- releases with mutch better print and better sound, because this movie stands one of the best classics of NON - LEONE'S spaghetti westerns at all times. Please do take my effort.
