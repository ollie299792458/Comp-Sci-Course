Well, I loved the movies. It was great, and had a Scream/Urban Legend feel to it (that being essentially what it is). So, if you liked those film, go for this. Continuing the review...

First movie was great, a bunch of nice twists, and a feeling like this could actually happen, not a Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street rip-off at all. The killer is a living, breathing man who wants revenge for these kids hitting him with their car and leaving him for dead. Some pretty good death scenes. Featured some great actors: Jennifer Love Hewitt, scream queen Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Freddie Prinze, Jr.

Second movie: Hey, you just can't expect a sequel that's better than the first film. Once again, a feeling of realism in this movie, and there are some good kills. Once again stars Jennifer and Freddie.

Third movie: Pssh, this sucked. Essentially the first movie remade with a sequel's title. Yeah, NOW the Fisherman's a supernatural killing machine that can't be stopped. Okay kills, but this was just a movie that should never have seen the light of day.

Collection: Fairly good. No commentary, but all trailers are included. There may have been a 'Making of' for the third film, not sure. The first two discs have blank sides, one for widescreen and the other for full. The third has a cover, and is in wide-screen. So, if you're a horror buff like me, get it. If you have the first one or two, I wouldn't get it. But if you saw it in theatres, or never saw it before, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. I got mine at Wal Mart for 20-so bucks. Worth it for three films.
