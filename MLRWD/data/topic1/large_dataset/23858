I am a sixty yr. old woman who loves to read. I was given the first book to read by a friend. I do not usually read books like this. I am a big Faye Kellerman fan for mystery/action reading. I absolutely loved the Twilight Sagas! I felt terrible for Stephanie Meyers after seeing Twilight, she was clearly taken advantage of as a novice to the world of film. I felt that Katherine Hardwicke was very narcissistic in her direction, all you have to do is listen to her commentaries on the film as to why she did what she did. don't even get me started with Ms. Rosenberg. she took a wonderful story and totally rewrote it!she inserted characters and scenes that were not even in the book. I had to re-read Twilight (not that this was the only time I had)to find out where the line " the kids liked those little bottles though" was in the book. guess what it isn't in the book like the character who said it. please for the sake of Stephanie's genius, get another writer before she destroys the last two like the first two. if she could write she would be, not doing this ie:..... those that can't teach".
