With quite a different story and much darker tone, Tim Burton's new twist on this spooky tale still brings to life the eerie autumn atmosphere of  Washington Irving's classic.
Set in 1799, "Sleepy Hollow" follows the adventures of Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a New York constable who is sent two days journey north to the tiny village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate who has committed a recent spate of gruesome beheadings.  A man of science and logic, Ichabod is most skeptical when the townspeople claim "The Headless Horseman" is responsible.  That is, until he witnesses a sample of the Horseman's handiwork himself!  What follows is a delightful blend of elements, with the film alternately a horror, fantasy, whodunit, romance and suspense.
The one problem with the film is that it delivers the goods too soon; there is little time spent building the mystery around the macabre spectacle of the Headless Horseman.  However, that does nothing to undermine an almost sufeit of visual and auditory treats - Tim Burton's intensely stylish (as always) direction takes off with Danny Elfman's brilliant (as always) score, uncanny visual effects, superb period detail, and scrumptious art direction, evoking the haunting and surreal atmosphere of Sleepy Hollow and the surrounding forest.  The scenes in which the Headless Horseman applies his trade are really fun, and while graphic, hardly gory, and done with a sense of wit and dark humor.  Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci stand out in a cast that could not be better.  Depp's idosyncratic portrayal of Ichabod Crane is perfectly complemented by the child-like beauty of Christina Ricci, and her delicate performance as Katrina Van Tassel.
On a misty October night with a crisp breeze blowing, I could suggest no better film to watch.  Just be certain not to loose your head.
