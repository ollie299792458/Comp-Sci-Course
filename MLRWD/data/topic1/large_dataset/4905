Although I can understand Hayden not being a top-rate actor, I think he does provide a decent performance for his genre. I feel as though he is given a bad rap when, well, in star wars he was kind of supposed to be a whiny teenager and in jumper he was supposed to be a dumb kid.

I felt the movie was quite entertaining. Period. Alot of people felt they wasted their time with the movie talking about how some things didn't make sense and how these people didn't explain themselves enough blah blah blah. Bottom line, it's a movie meant to entertain. I'm baffled by these people on here trash talking the movie when clearly we all know that Samuel L. Jackson doesn't do a whole lot of top shelf movies. Walk in to the theatre looking to be entertained, walk out entertained. Walk in pretending like you want to be entertained, walk out trash talking.

If you liked the bourne movies and don't mind filling in a few gaps, you'll enjoy the movie. The movie reminds me alot of Transformers, though I don't hear many bad reviews for THAT.

Flame on, but I probably wont look back.
