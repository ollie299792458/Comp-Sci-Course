There's a parallel here with another Warner Brothers documentary,the one that they released about Jimi Hendrix,in that the musical performances are all available on other video programs and with better sound or picture quality.In the days when this film was prepared,The Beatles' company Apple was stil adamantly opposed to the CD release of any unreleased Beatles music,and so The Beatles are represented on the soundtrack CD by standard released Beatles recordings.As a result,in order to make this film "conform" to the soundtrack CD,whenever Beatles concert performances are presented in this film,the real soundtracks are not used.Instead studio recordings are (sort of) synchronized to the on-screen lip movement,and in most cases this means ridiculously slowing down or speeding up the studio recordings,presenting them out of tune,and souped up with annoying quantities of reverberation to fake a live sound.John Lennon's career deserves a better documentary than this.Maybe someday we'll get it.This film should never have been released in this form on DVD.Buy "The Beatles Anthology" DVD set instead,or one of the other Apple/Capitol John Lennon DVD's,and see/hear these musical performances with better quality.
