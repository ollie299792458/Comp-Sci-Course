This movie did not turn out to be what I was expecting. Movie trailers quite often paint a different picture of a movie than what it actually is, and that is the case here.  This being said, I still enjoyed this film.

It is not a grand masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but that's fine.  Not every film I see has to be.  This story revolves around three individuals, and their experience with death.  One listens to the dead, one has a near-death experience, and one loses his twin brother.  The common thread in the film is that all three struggle to cope with their experience with death.  They each try to run away from it, try to understand it better, or try to bring closure to it.  The story finally brings the three characters together, and we see that they are united by the one thing that eludes them...death.

I thought the movie was well made, except perhaps for the beginning few things and the ghastly special effects during the tsunami. I think they could have simply done without that, and shown the French woman sinking in the water having her visions, which in the end is what we were to take away from her experience during the tragic circumstances she endured.

In good Clint Eastwood fashion, the film advances at a pace that allows the viewer to see the characters for what they are intended to be.  The movie is slow at times, but not disturbingly so.  It is meant to be.  I think there is meaning in each scene, and that is what I enjoyed.  In the end, we see that no matter what we do, death is always present, and is part of the cycle of life.

I gave this film a 4-star rating, mainly to offset the 1 or 2-star ratings it received, which I believe are not merited here.  I think a true rating would be a 3 1/2 star, which I believe this movie is currently receiving.  It is definitely worth seeing.
