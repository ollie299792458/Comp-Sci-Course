Excellent movie with a new type of heroine. No one rants about how beautiful, gentle, kind and intelligent she is. She's clumsy, insecure and feels like she's failing her family. Mulan is someone that most girls will relate to at some level.

Yet, she displays courage and stamina beyond any other Disney heroine. When it all comes down to it, (with the possible exception of Pocahontas), all the Disney gals need to be "rescued" by a prince or other supporting characters. She doesn't. SHE'S the hero at the end, combining both masculine strategy with feminine guile. The romance isn't quite so blatant and she can get along perfectly without a prince at the end. He comes to HER.

On another note, the grandmother was better comic relief than Mushu.

The animation is spectacular: the battle with the Huns, the Imperial palace and the mountain scenes are particularly breath-taking.

However, as a student of medieval history, I would have liked the Huns or Hsiung-nu as the Chinese called them, to be shown as shorter and that their saddles had stirrups--they were the first people to make widespread use of them.

Still, great movie.
