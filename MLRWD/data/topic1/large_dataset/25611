I wanted this movie in DVD format and was not displeased in any way. This movie is a timeless classic that reminds us what is important in life. I received the format in black & white and color (which I did not want, the color version I mean). James Stewart played the part of George Baily like no other person could have done. His girl-next-door wife played by Dianna Reed was the perfect part for a woman with her charms. I think we all have regrets in life over what we have done and have not done and plan to do. But this movie helps to keep us focused on the people around you and how your treatment of them affects them for years to come. Each of us influences the other and touches them in large and small ways, and the effects are long-lasting. It's A Wonderful Life also tells us that you don't have to work at some big Wall Street Firm, or in Hollywood, or in politics to make a difference. We all make a difference in our own way. Choosing to do good us up to us. You won't be disappointed with this movie.
