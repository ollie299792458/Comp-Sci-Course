Fringe is more about supernatural, which somehow is a very dangerous thing that the writers might be find it too easy to conceive a story without thinking too much of everything else, so for me, these supernatural thing are all about the overall feeling, especially the characters, and fringe is one of the best, the other being x-files, of course

Unlike the huge cast team of Lost, Fringe keeps the main cast to 4-5 people in the first two seasons and (now doubled, in season 3, as they have their alternate version), which allows them to develop fully and naturally without being compromised by others, (however I do worry as they enters season 3, there're too many people need to be taken care of)

Personally I really like the team of Olivia, Peter and Walter in the first two seasons, there're so much chemistry inside and the interaction is so brilliant, and the supporting team of Broyles and Astrid are top notch as well

Being the most difficult part of this show is too keep it within the frame of fringe while talking about the big picture, the parallel universe, in the first two seasons, I think Fringe did a great job using the pattern to lead the development, there's really nothing to dislike for me in this show for the first 2 seasons, so 5 stars

(I just wish they will still focus on fringe when they tell the return of Olivia in season 3, do not turn her into a superwoman capable of everything, please)
