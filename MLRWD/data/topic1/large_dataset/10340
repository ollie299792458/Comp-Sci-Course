THey absolutely RUINED this movie! I recommend reading the book, and NOT SEING THE FILM!! It should not say that it is absed on the book becasue it is NOT! THey are two different stories all together. I read the book and then saw the movie and I was disgusted. The book was amazing, It is now the best book I have ever read, but the movie is horrid! I don't even think this movie deserves ANY stars at all. Sure the movie was cast greatly, Little simon is the cutest thing inthe world, but the took out vital parts of the book, and never put them in the movie, they don't even end the same, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT??? The shot, The finger, EVERYTHING that was portrayed i nthe book, isn't even close to the movie! I hated this movie and it disappointed me greatly. They could have done a reat job, but no they had to go and ruin it for all of us. WHoever made tis movie needs to actually read the book and base the movie on the book, instead of making up stuff to make the  movie short and sweet. Sure if someone wh ohas never read the book would liek this movie, but not anyone in God's green earth would EVER liek the movie if they have read the book. Thanks, but no thanks.....
