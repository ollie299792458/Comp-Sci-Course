Grad students and their teacher who are also  helped by a very scared Priest of an unusual Christian Catholic holy order, investigate a green (very scary color... I guess) liquid in a glass receptacle or container in the basement of a rundown city cathedral -- the basement being a kind chapel "to Satan."

This receptacle holds the green shiny liquid trapped essence of Satan who is very Insistant on getting out of said container and causing "the Apocolypse"--"the end of the world as we know it"--a very very bad bad populated earth (scary-zombie-type-people ).

Trying not to give away much more of the well done plot, I will state it is Unusual in that the movie has a Long Scary buildup...which...

enhances the  terror to the ...breaking point (I, myself, was scared of nightmares/insanity..so to speak)

And, I Loved Every Terrorizing Minute of This Movie!

Also, sincerely, this movie was rented and watched by me thru "Video On Demand" and a less expensive and more satisfying movie experience is..rare:))<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P3KMVC">ASUS UL30A-X5 Thin and Light 13.3-Inch Black Laptop (12 Hours of Battery Life)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046HAO2C">ASUS A52F-XA1 15.6-Inch Versatile Entertainment Laptop (Black)</a>
