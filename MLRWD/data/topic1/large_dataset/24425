I saw "The Omen" on July 4, 1976, with my brother's fiance and her best friend.  The movie scared - literally - the mortal hell out of me.  So much that I, in pouring rain, emptied my VW of every conceivable upper, downer, laugher, screamer, etc. Now: Skip ahead 4 years:  I've just gotten fired from a great, well paying modeling job, and I'm living with a Brooke lookalike.  So what do we do?  Yup. Go see "The Final Conflict." Sam Neill is indisputably the most frightening, insidious character in any movie I've ever seen (with the exception of that terrifying bald woman who played Satan in "The Passion").  And the scene where the priest tries to stab Damien with one of the "holy knives," and gets caught in a blazing inferno....this is one frightening film, folks.  But you know what I like most about it?  At the end, Jesus kicks Damien's @$$.  Watch these flicks, especially the first and third (everybody says that the fourth installment ruined the integrity of the series).  And I can't stop without a warning:  PLEASE, folks, remember that somewhere in the world right now, whatever "Damien's" real name is, he's getting ready to start all this.  We are living in the end times.  You allright with The Lord?
