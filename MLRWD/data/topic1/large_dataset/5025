I want to preface this review by saying I have never watched the original Fullmetal Alchemist series or read the Manga. I'd hear good things, saw the Blu-Ray on a gold box deal, and bought it on a whim. That was a great decision.

First thing you'll notice when you pop in the blu-ray is that this show is GORGEOUS. I haven't owned any other anime on blu-ray yet, but the animation and the transfer look as good or better than any American animated films you can get on Blu-Ray. Animated films that aren't produced by Pixar anyway.

I'm fairly new to Anime, but I've jumped in head-first. I've watched the full runs of Bleach (ongoing), Soul Eater, Darker than Black and several others. This show belongs with the best of them. The story is compelling, the characters are fleshed-out and interesting (for the most part), and the animation is stellar. For an Anime fan this is must-see, but even if you've never watched an Anime this is just great television.

A few minor complaints: The show can be a bit melodramatic. The motivation of the brothers' and their past is upsetting and the emotions are earned and genuine. Following the first few episodes though the music starts hitting you a bit heavy, and the characters start giving many long tearful speeches about their feelings and what it all means. It's far from subtle. It's a small complaint early on, but as the show progresses it starts to take over a bit more. Still, it definitely earns the 5-star rating.

Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys things that are good.
