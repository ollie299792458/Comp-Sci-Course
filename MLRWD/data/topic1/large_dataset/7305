OK, People are complaining about the lack of commentaries on this set but it's really unavoidable. Commentaries on the other sets have been done mostly by the actors in the scene and they have no insight into what is behind the story of the scene in the scope of things which is what the community craves. They just make small talk and reminisce. That is because they don't want to give things away so if they gave you more commentaries it would just be more of this pointless small talk that adds nothing to the story. Do I want to listen to that kind of commentary, no! So why complain when they spare you from dealing with this ?

Unfortunately what this leads to is the conclusion that they "may" decide to re-release the discs with real commentary at a future date but only if they decide it's not better to let people endlessly speculate!
Patrick McGoogan only did limited talks about The Prisoner and the original series still spurs discussion. From what we can glean, he was guided by "gut" feel on a lot of it and he may not fully understand all the levels of it just as Bob Dylan is surprised by things that people find in his songs as he tries to make them rhyme. Sometimes there is divine inspiration coming through so it couldn't be fully explained anyway. But I digress...

1. I don't want to have anything revealed to me that would spoil my surprise as the show wraps up so I don't want significant plot points revealed in the commentary and I feel the show's creators feel the same way. After the show ends, My feelings on this subject will change but the show's creators opinion may not.
2. In light of first point, the only thing to do for people who want more commentaries is to have a whole bunch of actors on the show make small talk for each episode. Do you REALLY want to listen to all that?

So that's why it is what it is.
