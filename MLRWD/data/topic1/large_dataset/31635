Denzyl Washington stars with Tony Shaloub as FBI agents who ultimately must battle the U.S. Army, led by evil general Bruce Willis, who through some shenanigans, convinces the President to declare Marshall Law, allowing the Army to corral and torture Muslims in Brooklyn following several fictional bombings (including of the Federal building in NY where the FBI's offices are headquartered, leaving more than 600 dead).  Annette Benning plays a CIA agent, whose hands were dirty from the CIA's originally having trained (and later abandoned) the people who are behind the bombing.  In viewing the movie, we are reminded of what domestic evils might have occurred, had another couple of attacks taken place post-9/11.  We are also reminded of what evils actually did occur which might have been avoided, had we held ourselves to the "Denzel Washington true American values" standard.  The movie's depiction of  protests against torture and abuse of Muslim citizens by Jews, Blacks, Catholics, and others (and some good speeches by Denzyl) make us yearn for Denzyl-like leaders who would stand firm against extrajudicial rendition, torture, and other violations of U.S. and international law in a post 9/11 world.  Prophetic and cautionary movie in a number of ways, well worth watching.
