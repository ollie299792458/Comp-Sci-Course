I was 10 when I saw this movie in theaters.  I thought that it was hilarious.  Apparently others did not.  I've seen the film at least 10 times and it is just like Dumb and Dumber and Ace Ventura, it never gets old.  I consider this to be Jim Carrey's best performance and that is given alot of consideration..  The history behind this film is interesting (to say the least, it was originally a Chris Farley vehicle instead of Jim Carrey).

The DVD was pathetic.  It changed the 2.35:1 aspect ratio down to 4:3 and gave no special features.

Finally we get the release that this underrated dark comedy masterpiece deserves, complete with commentary, deleted scenes, gag reel, etc.  Also, the commentary isn't some crappy pre-release commentary that has been sitting in a can for 15 years, it is very recent and interesting because they give some very honest insight into their lives at the time of making the film and they reflect on how poorly the film was received.  Jim Carrey also mentions that this is the first commentary that he has ever done and he, ben stiller, and judd apatow briefly discuss the perks and the price of fame.

Hopefully we'll get a good release of Ace Ventura next.
