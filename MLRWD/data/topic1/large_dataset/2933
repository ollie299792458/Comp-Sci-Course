This story is based on a true medieval legend about a condemened thief,  Philippe (played by Matthew Broderick) who is rescued from an evil bishop's  guards by the former Captain of the Guards, Navarre (Rutger Hauer).  During  the day, Philippe is with Navarre and his trusty hawk.  At night, Philippe  is visited by a beautiful lady, Isabeau (Michelle Pfieffer) and her wolf.  Slowly, the horrifying truth comes to light.  Now Philippe must work with a  drunken monk (the always marvelous Leo McKern) to save Isabeau and Navarre  from the evil bishop (John Wood) who lusts after Isabeau.  The lighting on  the DVD version is better than the video and LaserDisc.  Previously, the  night scenes were too dark to see clearly what was happening in the story.  It has been corrected on the DVD.  The scenery is absolutely breathtaking  and the characters are very enjoyable.  You laugh at Philippe's antics and  feel frustration and sorrow with Isabeau and Navarre's plight.  This is a  wonderful story and one of my all-time favorites.
