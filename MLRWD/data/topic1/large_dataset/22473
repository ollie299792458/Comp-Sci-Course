Hey guys, Don Mcqueen here again.  I'm reviewing one of my favorites "Jack Frost."  Now I've read some of these othere reviews, and I not seeing much respect.  This movie is a classic.  The script was amazing, as were the actors.  In fact I wish I was in the movie.  It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole movie.  The ending is hard to beat.  It's a non-stop thrill as they try to kill the mighty snow man.  The shefiff in the movie was so convincing.  He even made it to the sequel, unlike most movie stars.  This man has talent and will keep you biting your nails the whole movie through.  It was snowing while I was watching this, so I was really intimidated.  I didn't go out of my house 3 days later, once the snow had melted.  I thought Jack Frost might jump out of the snow and kill me.  I'm gonna go ahead and give this one 5 stars.  If you want to see a real movie, check it out.  It may change the way you see Jack Frost completely.  Take care now ya hear.  This is Don Mcqueen signing off from Gators breath Florida.
