There are always certain movies we see in our lifetime that stand out in our memory.  For me, Curse of the Demon falls into that category.  Dad took the whole family plus a couple neighbor kids to see it at the Jungle Drive-In the summer it was released.  Imagine sitting in a car on a dark cloudy night with all the windows rolled down, crickets chirping softly in the woods that surrounded the theater while watching the chase scene through equally dark woods with the eerie "the demon is coming for you" sound as a backdrop. Ah, the sheer terror and we loved it!

Over the years I would watch it whenever I could find it on TV.  To say I was overjoyed when I found it was being released with both versions on DVD would be an understatement.  It arrived from Amazon in late August.  Imagine sitting in an unlit room on a dark cloudy night with the windows open in a house surrounded by woods, crickets chirping softly while watching the chase scene through equally dark woods with the eerie "the demon is coming for you" sound as a backdrop. Ah, the sheer terror and I loved it!
