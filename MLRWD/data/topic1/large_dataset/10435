Being someone that has grown up in Kansas City knowing that this is the only area in which the Civil War was fought where there are no statues or memorials to either side, it was very exciting that Hollywood finally made a movie which acurately depicts how it was here along the Kansas and Missouri border during the border war of the Civil War years.  Tobey Maguire is excellent as a German immigrant's son who is swept up in the Missouri "bushwhacker" cause in the border war against the "jayhawkers" headquarted in Lawrence, Kansas, a town founded by Massachusetts abolitionists.  The supporting cast is good as well, especially Jeffrey Wright who is spectacular as a slave fighting with the bushwhackers.  The Academy made a huge error overlooking him at Oscar time.  This film was released only in Kansas City, Los Angeles and New York.  This is as good as Ang Lee's other films and why it was not given a general release is a mystery.  But not to worry, now you can enjoy it in the peace of your own home.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed!
