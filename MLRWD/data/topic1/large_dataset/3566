Loved that first episode and am gladly ordering this new season based upon season 1 and the start of season 2..This show is the best thing on TV now and in all honesty ever. Timothy Olyphant as Raylan has improved which is amazing since he was awesome in season 1. Raylan is just so much fun and you just know with Boyd lurking about, there are more fun and fireworks coming between the two men. Plus the Bennetts are just going to be edge of your seat fun. So yes I am buying season 2 NOW

It is now a month since season 2 ended and that first impression after just one episode was not premature. Season 2 was so good. The critics say it best. Season One Justified was a good show and most shows in their sophomore year falter. Justified is the exception...it went from good to great. Season two was incredible and for the many who have yet to watch...trust the many reviews you are reading. This is a great show. It can be funny, emotional and violent in one episode. The humor is subtle, the violence surprising and the love stories done with taste and not an ounce of fluff. I hope this convinces even just one person to watch season 1 first and move on to season 2...I promise you will be glad you did.
