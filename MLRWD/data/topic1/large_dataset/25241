Here's a review from someone who actually has this item. So, let me get to the point. The box set is out of this world! I have all the seasons in my collection from their first release date. So, when I finally decided to go ahead and pick up the Complete Series, I was alittle worried that I was wasting my money by buying the seasons agian. But, when the box set came in by UPS yeasterday. I was blown away by the sight, wieght and very high quality of the item. It's has two book like dvd holders that are split by 1st to 5th seasons and 6th to 10th seasons. It's made of highly compressed board and will stay togather for a very long time. WB pulled out all the stops on this great set. It also comes with a very detailed Daily Planet news paper and a high gloss 24 page epoisode quide.

Not only is it the best set I've ever seen. It's has over 24 hours (two dvd's) of new features that will not be on the regular Season Ten set. I am a blu-ray owner and I can tell you the DVD's qaulity are great (plus any player will up sample the discs to almost 1080 dpi) So, this set only being released in DVD is not a problem for me. The set is so well put to gather I know if you decide to pick it up. You will not be dissapointed.
