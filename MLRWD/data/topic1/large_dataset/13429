Rhino joins the myriad of smaller companies that apparently know more about DVD authoring and extras than Paramount. While I was disappointed that Rhino couldn't put it in widescreen, they more than make up for that with a new 5.1 audio track, 25 PSA's from the cartoon series, two classic toy commercials from the 60's and tv trailers for the movie. Another nicety would've been possible an alternate track with some commentary either by the voice actors or writers, but I can live without having it.
If you have a good audio setup you'll really appreciate the audio remastering Rhino has done. Little touches like background conversations and items falling to the ground become easier to hear and understand. For someone that has watched this movie several times before these little nuances give you a reason to watch it again. Definately one of the best transfers audiowise I've heard in a longtime.
Storywise I won't lie to you: it sucks. What was meant as a joke by the writer who fully believe no one would take it seriously became loved by the boys at Hasbro and Cobra-La was born. Old favorites are pushed to the wayside as new characters are introduced to coincide with the release of their action figure counterparts in the stores. And while not as sad as Orson Welles doing the voice of Unicron in the Transformers movie, Burgess Meredith's addition to the cast may bring a slight tear to the eye.
For the Joe or DVD addict this is one meant to be owned and rewatched. The additions by Rhino make it worth the price (a lesson Paramount needs to learn) If you're not into the niceties that DVD's offer or you're buying for the not so rabid Joe fan I'd save the greenbacks and get the movie on VHS.
