This is Hitch's least "heady" film -- the sheer physical beauty of Grace Kelly in her prime, Cary Grant in his, and the French Mediterranean in its, they all conspire to confound intellectualization. The screen seems slick with the vapors of the stars' physical luminosity.

Even the simplest props, like garments, echo this celebration of stylized cinematic glamor and beauty. Grace's whispy gowns and Grant's bespoke casual attire seem to animate the screen with enough energy to be characters themselves! Kelly's eyes hypnotize! Watching Grant slip his hand into his trouser pockets or stride across the street is equally mesmerizing.

The tale combines suspense with comedy in a way that is utterly unique in all of Hitchcock's American work. TCAT lacks the gravitas of Notorious, the polished and self-conscious artistry of Spellbound, the metronomic rhythm of Rear Window, the spiraling tension of North by Northwest and the emotional range of Vertigo. But it offers a telling sidelight -- the shimmering splendor of pure sensuous beauty.

I suspect that this strain of hedonic delight represents a significant, if somewhat rare, component of Hitchock's ethos.
