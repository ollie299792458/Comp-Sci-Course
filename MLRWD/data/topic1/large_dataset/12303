First, I would like to review the film. I am only 14, and my dad made me watch it on television. I agreed because it was good excuse to stay up until 3:00 in the morning. He grew up only miles away from the setting, and was there during this time period. He says it really depicts what life was like then. 
The movie is great, and has supurb acting. I'm sure you will see all about that in the reviews, so I will get to my next point...
As for all of you agianst the movie simply because of what you think is racism: I think many of you fail to see, or just down want to believe the truth. Sure Americans killed many Vietnamese, but the Vietnamese captured soldiers and did do what is depicted in the movie. Perhaps it was a selective depiction of us as the "good guys", and them as the "bad guys", but the movie wasnt to inform you about the Vietnamese. It shows you how people are affected by war, and why it is such a horrible thing. It made me extremely anti-war now, and so I think it conveys a wonderful message. As for Russian roulette... that was to show how "Nick" loses his sanity. He was scared and couldn't bare to do it for the Vietnamese, but his quality of life was so ruined, he began to think it didn't matter...
This is a great movie... don't believe the narrowminded reviewers that gave it one, two, or maybe three stars!
