I'm prejudiced because this is my all-time favorite screwball comedy and it might just be my favorite comedy of all time.  To watch the purely gorgeous and suave Cary Grant play an absent-minded professor complete with glasses and dinosaur bone and to see him caught up in this insane adventure with the free-spirited and looney Katherine Hepburn is a treat not to be missed.  I've been anticipating the DVD special edition even though expanded editions of classic movies can sometimes be a disappointment.  I haven't seen all the features on disk two but can comment on the commentary of Peter Bogdonavich.  I enjoyed it because of his obvious love of the movie and I liked that he enjoys watching it as much as I do.  He also quotes extensively from an interview he did with Howard Hawks and a lot of what he shares is fairly enlightening.  DVD's of classic movies just don't have great commentary because everyone associated with the picture is, well, either dead or greatly infirm so Bogdonavich's is decent and better than most.  So to fans of Hepburn, Grant or just brilliant comedy in general, I can heartily recommend this DVD edition.  It's such a cliche but they really do not make movies like this anymore.
