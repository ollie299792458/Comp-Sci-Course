This romantic comedy, featuring an array of the best of British actors and actresses, is very well-made and clever in many places.  I would love to show it to my whole family, but that's not possible. It contains a number of romantic subplots - some heartwarming, some humorous, some poignant - interleaved with what can only be characterized as pornography.  
The movie honestly troubles me.  I want to watch it with my wife.  Yet, while I know she'd love 90% of it, that 10% which would be completely offensive spoils the whole thing.  If I could convey one message to the producer and director, it would be:  what good is it to make a romantic comedy that couples can't watch in each others' company?
I have to recommend the movie.  It's got many good storylines, and a lot of excellent acting.  Sixty seconds of additional editing, and it would have been absolutely exquisite. But don't watch it until you've reread the above paragraphs and concluded that you're broadminded enough to tolerate the tasteless parts.
