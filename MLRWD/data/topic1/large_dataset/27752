I have always loved Kurosawa's Samurai movies.  From Yojimbo to the Samurai Trilogy, from Ran to Seven Samurai.  I think his greatest two movies though are not samurai but more realistic (down to earth) movie dealing with the human mind.  Red Beard is one and Rashomon is the other.  I think Rashomon is a great movie to sit down and watch over and over again just to try and figure out the true answer in the movie.  Yes, yet another movie that Director Kurosawa-san brought out Mifune-san as one of the lead actors, although this was one of the early years.  
I beleive that Toshiro Mifune is the greatest actor of all time.  I beleived that he was a compassionate doctor in Red Beard, a very strong Miyamoto Musashi, and even a Noble Makabe Rokuroto in Hidden Fortress.  In Rashomon, I actually beleived he was a little son of a gun thief and lunatic.
Another good, but short role is played by Minoru Chiaki.  It seems that he always gets the same role and always short.  He also stars in a few other movies with Mifune/Kurosawa.
