A non-horror movie of definite interest to horror collectors! Courtesy mainly of King Kong, Jaws and Jurassic Park, Harry Hoyt's ambitious 1925 film version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic novel, The Lost World, carries some heavyweight genre lineage. Wallace Beery plays the inimitable Professor Challenger who leads an expedition to a lost land roaming with dinosaurs. Few reviewers of Steven Spielberg's abysmal Jurassic Park sequel The Lost World appear to have had sufficient-enough genre grounding to recognise any connection to its 1925 namesake, let alone the remarkable and probably (given Spielberg's admirably consistent homage to cinematic antecedents) deliberate - similarity between Spielberg's awful final act (a T-Rex rampages through San Diego) and Hoyt's (a brontosaurus rampages through London). The creative genius responsible for design of the dinosaurs in Hoyt's Lost World, Willis `O Brien, would go on to achieve genre immortality for his decidedly more sophisticated work in King Kong (1933), thus laying the ground for later horror-fantasy make-up and design legends like Ray Harryhausen (Jason and the Argonauts), Stan Winston (Jurassic Park), Rick Baker (An American Werewolf in London), Tom Savini (Friday the 13th; Dawn of the Dead), Dick Smith (The Exorcist) and H.R. Giger (Alien). Another one for your collection.
