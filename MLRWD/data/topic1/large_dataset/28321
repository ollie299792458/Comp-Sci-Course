Let me begin by saying that I am not a fan of Disney movies--live or animated--made after their 1982 classic TRON.  None of the subsequent formulaic bilgewater has any relevance.

Treasure Island was released before another classic 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by four years but is classic story-telling at its best.  With their well-timed incidental music and Technicolor tropical scenery, Treasure Island delivers on almost every level.  Robert Newton's portrayal of the pegleg pirate Long John Silver is iconic and set the standard for buccaneer speech with his semi-Irish brogue until Johnny Depp started the Jack Sparrow staggering style in a recent Disney pirate trilogy. (I am sure you know of what I speak.)  Newton's Silver has been the gold standard that virtually all pirate actors have used, even the sea captains on TV's The Simpsons and Family Guy.

Perhaps the only detraction I can offer is the scrunched face of actor Bobby Driscoll, whose facial contortions as young Jim Hawkins fill me with concern that he is in desperate need of a trip to the toilet.  It is unfortunate that, despite his success as Peter Pan three years later, he died an unfortunate death alone and broken.

This is a fantastic movie that children only exposed to pirate stories from Pirates of the Caribbean or Veggie Tales should be able to enjoy and treasure!
