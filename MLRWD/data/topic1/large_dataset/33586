This satire directed by Barry Levinson (And Justice For All) rather than becoming 'dated' gets more delicious and enlightening with age.
The title 'Wag The Dog', originally referred to the need for reality to fashion itself to conform to the power of television.  In order to play to the people, the facts had to be styled to meet the method of distribution. 
The film now offers a much greater lesson and a warning to the population of the great lengths to which politicians and the government might go to deceive the American people and/or fabricate 'truth' to suit their own end.
The commentary, although only five years old, has become the most 'dated' feature on the DVD.
The multiple occurrences of: the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal, the Gulf War, Afghanistan, the terrorists and 09/11/2001, colored ribbons, 'spontaneous' waves of patriotism, and the recent war in Iraq (particularly the revelation of the true facts surrounding the rescue of Jessica Lynch) have made 'Wag The Dog' more cutting edge with the advent of each individual incident.  
Today's viewers must continually and repeatedly jolt themselves back to reality with reminders that they are NOT viewing an  educational documentary on 'spin' or a how-to-film outlining  methods for fabricating and implementing diversion, but are instead viewing an entertaining and satirical film developed well before the occurrence of any of the events listed above. 
This is a film where David Mamet, well known for his realistic dialogue, had the character's speaking the future in a most frightening way.  
'Wag The Dog' is great viewing for new and repeat viewers alike.  It is a reminder of how we the public can be misled by what we see and hear in the press and on television.  The film itself is however not misleading, but thought-provoking, and as it chillingly turns out, perhaps even more realistic than we knew in 1997.
