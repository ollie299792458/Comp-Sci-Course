Ok well if you didn't like the "It's Gary Shandling Show" then maybe it's a pass but honestly I think you do yourself a favor for checking this out. I'm in my 30's and didn't really like the show when I was younger. The themes are adult and the general tone is likewise. But after putting on a few years, not to mention pounds...  This show now sparkles.
Mine was a backwards introduction I must admit. I enjoyed Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm more and more as the years went on. Now Curbed is a ritual in our house. Why does this matter you may ask...  They were the result of the brilliance that is The Larry Sanders Show. It was the trailblazer that began the comedy style shown in todays most popular shows (The Office, etc.)
Based on my love of these shows I decided to give this another chance some 20 years after I first had the opportunity and passed.  The show is built for an adult audience. This is mature humor and can be subtle in most instances. But that is what makes it truly brilliant. Instead of standing in a room and screaming out "look at me" the comedy is crafted. Rip Torn, Janeane Garofolo, Jeremy Piven, and Jeffrey Tambor highlight the supporting cast in this show devoted to late night talk shows and the stars that inhabit them. The stars range and include a who's who of todays stars. Just on that point alone the set is valuable. It's great to see the character interaction as Larry steps into problem after problem.
In short it is a great building block for the comedies of today. The set is nice and well put together with no packaging issues as you would expect for the price. There has been a price reduction which I think makes it an easier grab. Being someone who did not watch any of it.... It's well worth the price of admission. A solid bet for the comedy fan.
Thank you for reading.
