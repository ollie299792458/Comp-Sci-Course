I saw this movie 6 years ago. I still watch it every now and then. I enjoyed it so much and everyone I showed it to enjoyed it. It is about 6 people from different backgrounds who wake up one day to find themselves locked in a room (Cube) with six doors leading to other rooms. Each room has some sort of hidden mechanical torture device. The movie is about why what and how. The Cube.. who built it? Why were they thrown there? How to escape? Etc...

If you are a mathematician -or understand math for that matter- you'll appreciate the accuracy of the puzzle aspect of the movie.. Truly well done. It's a rarity among movies and very refreshing to see a movie where the movie maker actually done some research. The plot in my opinion is solid and if you think there are holes in the plot then look again and watch it again. It's worth it. Some people describe the movie as "too mechanical" but I think that was the point of the movie. Not to ruin it for anyone who didn't watch but after seeing it you'll get what the movie maker is trying to say.

As for the DVD version, not much additions. Just some deleted scenes.

BTW AVOID the sequel. It is named "Hypercube". Totally rubbish.
