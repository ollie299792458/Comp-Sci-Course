Once again, Pixar has managed to create something that is both visually stunning and emotionally heartfelt! Toy Story 3 is a wonderful end to the trilogy of the toys we have all come to know and love. Almost all of our favorites are back and Andy is heading for college.

I don't want to give any plot away for the few and far between who have not seen it, but it has something for everyone - adults and children alike. Nostalgia for us grown-ups and great imaginative development for the kids. The story is engaging and will make you laugh (and cry). It is not too long for a toddler to sit through and enjoy, but long enough to give enough time to the development of the newest characters, and bring closure to the story as a whole.

The 4 disc set is a great choice if you have a blu-ray player and also travel with your kids - you have the blu-ray for home, the regular dvd for travel to Grandma's, and the digital copy for on the go!

We took our daughter to see this in the theatre and she has been asking to see it again ever since! She has watched the DVD at least 4 times since it arrived - all the way through, beginning to end!!

Pixar knows how to tell a great story!!! We can't wait for the next one!
