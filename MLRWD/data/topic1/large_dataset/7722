I have to agree with "Boss Fan" in his desire to counteract the ridiculous and pointless bashing of a movie that isn't even out yet. If "John Q. Public" doesn't like the earlier films of Kevin Smith, fine. He's entitled to his opinion. If he would like to write reviews of each of those movies on their respective pages, also fine, although I hope he would explain what specifically he did not like and back up his opinions with thoughful, logical arguments.

That being said, I really like all of Kevin's past movies. I understand why some people don't like them and why none of them have been enormously successful. It's a mighty difficult tightrope to walk trying to balance poop and [...] jokes with intelligent, thoughful commentary on the world around us, but Kevin does a pretty impressive job of managing the feat. He's tackled the nature of male/female relationships, the profundity of God, religion and the Catholic Church, and the stuggle between single parenthood and career. All the while, he's managed to make me laugh like hell.

Is "Clerks II" any good? I don't know yet, but you can bet I'll be seeing it opening weekend. And if Kevin Smith's track record means anything at all, it will be riotously funny with maybe a little something to think about after it's over (even if it's only whether contract employees building the second Death Star were supporting a tyranical ruler and deserved to die or they were innocent victims of a war they had nothing to do with).

While waiting to decide for yourself if "Clerks II" is a good movie or not, check out Kevin Smith's other movies: "Clerks," "Mallrats," "Chasing Amy," "Dogma," "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back," and "Jersey Girl." I highly recommend all of them.
