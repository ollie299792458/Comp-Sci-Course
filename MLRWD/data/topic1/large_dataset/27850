This movie by HBO far exceeded my expectations. Having lived during the 1960s the Director Billy Crystal's authentic re-enactment is outstanding. Heroic quest by far too human players, very realistically and accurately portrayed. The featurette on how "61*" was filmed, directed and produced is a great foreward to the DVD movie itself. Billy Crystal created a special film and homage to Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle, that will stand the test of time and entertainment to future generations and all fans of sports. Billy Crystal has made a film classic. I recall a fairly big argument over the type of baseballs used in Babe Ruth's time and the era of Mantle & Maris. Billy Crystal never introduced this aspect of the homerun race and the 'lively' baseballs of the 1960s compared to the argued 'deadened' baseballs in the earlier era of Babe Ruth. Mark McQuire's suspected 'juiced' shadows over his breaking of Maris' record isn't discussed, either. Great sport story told as well as one would expect of a classic film for the record books.
