After having seen far too many gay independent movies that are promised/reviewed as being worthwhile (and finding out the hard way they're mostly not--for example most recently, "Is It Just Me?"), it's a relief to finally come across one that is genuinely wonderful.  I won't beat around the bush:  I loved "You Should Meet My Son."  It goes a long way towards making up for all the bad independent gay movies I've seen along the way.  It's a movie with a very big heart, and it's both funny and touching.  For whatever shortcomings there may be in the acting or script, they're largely irrelevant in the final analysis because the end result is so much greater than the sum of the parts.  It's not a perfect movie, but even still, it's extremely affirming, embracing, and rather touching.  I don't doubt this is a movie I will want to see again more than once in the future.  Congratulations to Keith Hartman (the writer/director) for a job well done.  Also, among the extras on the DVD are earlier short videos that Hartman made.  My favorite of the lot is "The Defenders" from 2009--it's fantastic and really funny, while also getting the point across rather potently.  You can also view "The Defenders" free on on YouTube.
