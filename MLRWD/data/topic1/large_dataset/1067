...which isn't saying much.  We've had Red Planet, Mission To Mars and, er, some others.  Made when "CGI" wasn't in the modern film maker's lexicon, it contains the best latex-driven, gross-out puppetry that has yet to be bettered.  Watching this film really does reinforce the opinion that on-set effects are far more interesting to watch than a moving image on an Amiga.  The film's story is more twisty-turny than most late 80's actioners, and by the end you'll still have questions.  Which is what SF is all about.

The extras on this special edition are actually quite rubbish.  There's a documentary on the making of the film edited by a gibbon.  Someone says "I ran to the office with the revised script" and we cut to a shot of Arnie running in the film.  Someone says "Paul Verhoven was making faces on set" and we cut to a gurgling Arnie at the end of the film with his eyes popping out of his head.  This happens ALL THE TIME.  We obviously can't imagine what the interviewees are saying so we have to have brief visual descriptions.  Because we're thick.

The Arnie commentary is pretty bad.  It starts off pretty well but then degenerates into "This is me pulling a bug out of my head."  Presumably descriptions for blind people.  He obviously can't remember the film at all which is criminal considering he was paid more than I earn in a year to do it.  There's another commentary by two Germans which was panned by critics for being in German.  But they're Germans.  So they're going to talk German.  Do you see?

Excellent film.  Wasn't worth the wait for the special edition though.
