Although not as thrilling as John Frankenheimer's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/079284047X">The Train</a>, starring Burt Lancaster, who did his own stunts, "Von Ryan's Express" is still a mild diversion.

The main problem with this film, as I see it, is that, unlike "The Train," there is no one particularly nasty adversary who embodies all the evil and stubbornness that stands in the way of the goal, in this case, an  escape by POWs. Instead, the escapees are merely trying to evade the German army rather than a monomaniacal officer.

Wolfgang Preiss, who also appeared in "The Train," does his usual turn as a Nazi officer, but he is not a major figure. 'Von' Ryan (Frank Sinatra) is only mildly opposed by the British officer (Trevor Howard),  who questions his methods. As a result, the tension between the two personalities is rather tame.

I suspect that Sinatra didn't want to share center stage with Howard, who is quite capable of portraying a nasty piece of work if given the opportunity.

Disc One contains the movie and "An isolated track score with commentary," a confused affair that didn't live up to expectations. Disc Two has four modest featurettes and a few odds and ends.

If you're looking for World War II excitement and don't already own "The Train," <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGTQ7U">The Guns of Navarone (Collector's Edition)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKNME">Where Eagles Dare</a>, I'd skip "Von Ryan" and go for one of those.
