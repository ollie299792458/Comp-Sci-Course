I saw this a few years back at the Fant-Asia film festival in Calgary and I was just stunned.  From what I've heard, they just don't make slasher/horror films that often in Asia, so when they set out to shock and horrify, they go to the extreme, in true Asian style.  This story concerns a serial killer posing as a restaurant prorietor who goes into violent rages and indulges in sadistic acts.  For those of you used to Anime and other far-out Asian arts, you may be already jaded and unaffected, but for those of you looking for something to disturb you, seek this out.  it's not an atypical story by any means, but the murder scenes are pretty grisly.  One guy gets chopped up into dim sum. In another sequence, a family gets hacked to pieces...you ever notice in Hollywood where murdered children get killed offscreen?  Not here. there's also a graphic rape scene involving chopsticks that ain't exactly feminist-friendly.  Needless to say, with every succesive murder during the screening. more and more people walked out.  It's rare you see a horror film provoking anything more than laughter nowadays.  This one is all out, gung-ho savagery.  What's even weirder is the moments of slapstick that pop-up whenever the cops are in a scene.  A strange way to lighten the darker scenes, but, that's Asian cinema for you...unpredictable, daring, extreme and the polar opposite of Western filmmaking.  The guy who plays the killer won some prestigious awards in awards for his portrayal, and he deserves them.  very creepy and convincing.  Go to your local Chinese videostore and try and get this gem and play it at your next sleepover party.
