I was very disappointed with this movie. I am not a big fan of Jane Fonda but she was the only person in this movie who can act. The male star could have been played by a monkey. No one would have noticed.

This is the third movie I've seen with Jennifer Lopez. I will NEVER watch another one. She cannot act. She has as much screen presence as a door knob.

It seems that Ms. Lopez has gained some weight since her last movie. Is it necessary for the cameraman to draw so much attention to her large rear? The camerman should also keep the camera off of Ms. Lopez's bare feet - too big.

Was this movie supposed to be a comedy? Why was the "assistant" portrayed as a black dialect speaking woman? What professional woman would have an "assistant" like that? Stereotyped blacks are so out of date.

Jennifer Lopez seems to specialize in making movies where she, as a poor girl, marries a rich guy. I guess there is a market for this kind of movie but the class and cultural differences shown in the movie were so obvious even suspended logic cannot make this movie enjoyable. This movie was not a "Pretty Woman."

I threw away the DVD after watching this film.
