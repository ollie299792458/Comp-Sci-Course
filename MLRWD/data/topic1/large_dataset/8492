I was all of three years old when Flashdance was released in the spring of 1983.  However, while I was too young to see the movie, I knew the soundtrack by heart thanks to my older sister.  My mom finally decided I would be allowed to watch the movie when it was aired on NBC in early 1988.  Needless to say I loved it after all the years of waiting.

Everyone knows the plot,  welder by day, dancer by night.  Jennifer Beals was an unknown when she made this movie, and the movie transformed her (briefly) into a sensation.  She had a hard time following this film up,  but luckily due to Showtime's The L Word, she is back on top of her game.

Flashdance is not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination,  if anything, it's some of the worst character development (save Beals' Alex) a movie this big has ever seen.  But all is forgiven when the music comes on.  This movie was made when MTV (when MTV meant music) was beginning to take off... this was in many ways like a series of music videos interspread with story.  From Maniac to Gloria to What A Feeling, this movie emphasised on music in a way unseen except maybe Saturday Night Fever.

I have seen Flashdance countless times, and I rushed out to buy the DVD the same week it came out, because I wanted it that badly.

I hope Paramount will give us a special edition DVD along the lines of Footloose... Beals is hot again, they can always bring her in for an interview or something like that.
