This musical takes one of the most popular stories of all time and makes it into a living, breathing drama.  Names we are taught to recite as children leap out of the gray annals of history into vibrant people with hopes, desires, and fears.
Judas becomes much more than the simple, vicious villain of old.  He is scared, and he is weak, and, incredibly, idealistic!  Herod is a vicious fop, Mary Magdalene is a kind-hearted woman, torn between her past and growing emotions for the man Jesus.  Pontius Pilate, in one of the most intimate and thrilling songs of the play, "Pilate's Dream", becomes far more than the Roman toady of lore.
The movie adaption of this musical does exactly what it should:  let the music do the talking (singing, in this case).  It is cinematically vivid, but more as a background than a part of the action.  The core of this film is the spectacular performance of the cast.
I feel, as a long time fan of this musical, that a first-time viewer should see the movie first.  Unless the viewer is very well versed in the bible, they need to see who these characters are to comprehend--they need to see the Pharisees in their vicious, scared gaggle, the lepers swarming about Jesus, and all that the movie has to show.  This movie helped me to place the sundry characters in the songs.  
Now, no one is going to watch this movie and think it was made last year.  You need to be aware, as a watcher, that this is cut from the same filmmaking cloth as Enter the Dragon, rather than the Godfather.  
However, if you can get past that, buy this, watch it, listen to it, and love it.
