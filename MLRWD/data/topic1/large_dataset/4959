I happened upon "Raising Victor Vargas" by chance.  I was surfing my cable channels on Sunday night and stopped at Indieplex.  The movie immediately seemed interesting and quite unlike all of the big-budget movies I had been watching on the usual cable channels.  The characters were so realistic that it was as if I was watching a reality tv show.  However, this was much better than any of those reality tv shows that are so scripted that they are beginning to turn into "non-reality shows."  While I watched the movie, I got this feeling that the characters were real.  In the credits at the end of the movie, I discovered that Victor and Nino are brothers in real life.  Their sister and grandmother were realistically portrayed as well.  While watching the movie, I noticed subtleties that made it even more realistic such as the way that Nino showed his brotherly love for Victor while sleeping in the same bed as him and the manner in which Victor finally kissed Judy.  It was obviously his first "real" kiss.  The setting became an integral part of the movie as well.  Victor's apartment and the streets were real and made me feel as if I could walk right onto the set.  The movie was so endearing that I did not want it to end.  I kept looking at the clock hoping that it would not be over.  I hardly ever do this when watching a movie.  I highly recommend that you watch the movie, especially if you are looking for a change of pace from the usual big-budget movies that are being produced nowadays. The movie left me wondering what Victor, Judy, and Nino would be doing today.
