From the opening image of a scorpion being swarmed by ants, to the aftermath of The Battle of Bloody Porch, this film holds you captive in a way few films ever could. It has few (if any) of the traditional trappings of Western films. There are no good guys. At best, the protagonists are murderers and thieves with a code of ethics. There is no damsel in distress, no town to save from the clutches of a villain, no opportunity whatsoever for the terrible men of the film to redeem themselves in any meaningful sense. Even the climactic gunfight transcends the Western genre, and can only be described as one of the most beautiful and terrible orgies of violence ever put to film. 
Ultimately, The Wild Bunch is more than the "last" Western. Though it is in a sense a eulogy to the genre (outside perhaps "Unforgiven", one would be hard pressed to think of any Western made since "The Wild Bunch" that is even remotely as powerful), it is also a eulogy to a lifestyle, and more importantly, an examination of the contradictory qualities of being human. Humans have great capacity for senseless violence. But perhaps even the worst of us have some lines we will not cross. Ultimately, it is not retribution for their sins that does in the Wild Bunch. It is their (likely distorted) since of honor for which they make their final stand. While this may not redeem the Wild Bunch as men, it does make the film challenging and compelling.
