It is a shame that the translation in subtitles is not optimal and that the dubbed voices lack the emotional qualities of the actors supposedly talking.  Cantonese is beautiful to listen to but when this film was dubbed the emotions and nuances were eliminated.  The actors in this film did a great job and if you can only understand English you are missing a lot.

That being said I think Hollywood has tried to rip off this movie already once (why not, there are at least 2 sequels in Hong Kong) but did not succeed.

The story is great and you have great actors in the top 4 roles giving good, intense acting jobs.  This film is about good and evil and that the difference is only by an individual's perspective.  This film is really about perceptions as much as "The Matrix" was, except it shows you both sides of the perspective as equal.  Never has such an intellectual movie been done as entertainment or a police / crime story although the alternate ending lessens the actual movie.  Check out the alternate ending only to see that Mr. Lau (yes he is one of the stars) chose the correct ending.

One last thing, I think Americans could have used a little more screen time for Kelly Chen (the therapist) so that they could find out about her talent.
