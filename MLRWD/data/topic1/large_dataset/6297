I first saw the Godspell movie in a high school religion class in the 70's.  As a kid who was raised on musicals and a recent convert to Christianity (I am Jewish), I was originally very inspired by this movie. The movie contains classic theatrics, wonderfully crafted music and inspriring performances.  The characters are all fun and can be related to.

I own the original score/record album, and had enjoyed the music for many years.  I thought I would fun to pick up the video so that my 10 year daughter, who is now very involved in the theater could enjoy it.

Watching this movie after 30 years was a delightful trip down memory lane. I depicts the Gospel of Matthew in modern and relevant terms (relevant to life in the 70's) that were enacted in a 70's form and fashion.  The combination of these factors make this movie very interesting and educational.  Dancing scenes on the roof of the Twin Trade Towers are especially inspiring. Sad too.

Some of the scenes depicting the parables are a bit dry and hard to follow.  If redone, this is where a good director could do a better job of bringing out the story.  Otherwise, this is a great investment for your video library (no DVD available).

Overall, this is a great movie for the family, I recommend very highly!
