As the title of my review reflects, I am a woman who luckily has only suffered the degradation and fear of being "Date Raped". But the most riveting line in the movie is the scene on the subway, when a young "gang-banger" asked her "Have you ever been f***** with a knife?" I am asking men who are reading this: What if a man who was stronger and pointing a gun at you, cornered you in an isolated place made this threat, clearly capable and intending to carry it out? In your most private and vulnerable place?

If you had a gun, which she was using as protection, because, for her, the world was no longer safe, I believe most men would find that they would do anything to protect themselves as well. Because rape is about power and humiliation and degradation.

Finally, she also saved a homeless girl (obviously underage)from a vicious pimp and got her to safety. This film was about vindication and protection and Terrance Howard's character, a detective who had been following the case, understood. He took her gun, and her promise that the killing would stop. And it did.

Thank you for considering my comments.
