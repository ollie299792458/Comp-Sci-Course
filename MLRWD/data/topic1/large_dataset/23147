I've watch hundreds, perhaps thousands of movies in my life. I only own one DVD though, and this is it. Don't let the previews or commercials fool you. They show some of the worst parts of the movie. Despite being a very stupid movie, it's also one of the most creative, original, and just plain funny movies ever made.
Half this movie is not original, but is taken directly from an old 1970s Hong Kong Film. What better way to spoof an old martial arts films then to actually use the film itself. Using modern technology, the main character, the Chosen One, is inserted into the old film, replacing the original main star. Then the whole movie is dubbed. Let me just say that those voices are the most hilarious voices ever. For anyone who has watched old Kung Fu films and made fun of them (especially the dubbing), or any fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, this movie is great.
The characters are enjoyable, especially the dreaded enemy, Master Tang, or as he likes to be called, Betty, or Wimp Lo, a young fighter who was trained wrong as a joke.
The DVD extras are great. The cut scenes are funny, but the alternative audio tracks are hilarious. The commentary gives a glimpse of the comic genius that created this film. There is also the Book on Tape track, where only one British guy, in the an extremely proper accent, dubs the whole movie itself. Finally, there is the what they were really saying track, where the actors, in order to preserve the bad dubbing quality of the 70s films speak entirely different lines than what is actually dubbed. Pretty darn funny.
If you appreciate creativity, originality, and a funny, stupid movie, you have to check this DVD out.
