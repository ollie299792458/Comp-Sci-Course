This movie is quite simply perfect.  Life and death, love and friendship they're all explored here in some detail.  There is so much more here than just a film for people looking for gay issues explored.  Here we have the story of the fictionalized last days of Frankenstein director James Whale, but more specifically what we have is the story of a friendship between two characters who need something from each other.  One who doesn't know how to live, and the other who doesn't know how to die.  They both have something to bring to the relationship that ultimately helps the other to grow, although in a sad bittersweet context in the case of Ian McKellen's character.

The movie is a wonderful showplace for Ian McKellen's talents as an actor, and he is mesmerizing as Whale.  And Brendan Fraser unexpectantly demonstrates that he is much much more than just another sometimes goofy Hollywood pretty boy, in his portrayal of Clayton Boone.  But it is the growth and development of the friendship between Whale and Boone culminating in the dramatic final scene between the two characters is what ultimately makes this movie unforgettable.  The beauty of watching Clay rise above his fears of homosexuality and leave himself vulnerable in an act of love and compassion towards helping his ailing friend is breathtaking to behold, and the final resulting climax when Whale  reveals what he really wants from Boone, will leave you in tears.

In short, no matter what subject matter you're looking for in a movie, if you just love movies that are brilliantly acted, can easily pull you into a story line, and that stay with you long after the DVD has ended, buy this movie.  You won't regret it.
