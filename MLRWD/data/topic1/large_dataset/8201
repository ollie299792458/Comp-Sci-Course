I only really remember seeing one other Chanel biopic in the 80s, but I don't remember the designer being portrayed as curmudgeonly as she is here.  As much as I adore Audrey Tautou, and as much as I enjoyed this latest peek into what is probably the most critical part of her life and career, I felt that the titular character was a tad gloomy.  In fact too much of a wet blanket to be credibly worthy of attracting not one but two successful members of the upper class.  "Really?" was a question that came to mind not a few times.  Even her attempts at breaking away from the current fashion of her day, I thought were dowdy and bereft of any sex appeal.  There might have been a tiny bit of elegance in the austere simplicity of her designs, but it is hard to imagine them taking anyone's breath away.  Her real genius is only given room to fluoresce in the end, when she is finally transformed into the Chanel that we have come to know.  But we are left wondering how in the world did she get there?
