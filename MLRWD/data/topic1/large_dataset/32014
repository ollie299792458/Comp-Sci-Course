This extraordinarily good movie mixes government intrigue with a normal run-of-the-mill guy, who would have been a computer nerd if the movie had not been set in the mid seventies. Robert Redford is the consummate bookworm, stuck with the rather innocuous job of reading almost everything published in search of hidden word patterns, etc. that operators may have planted in otherwise innocent material, so as to organize covert operations right under the nose of the CIA and the U.S. government. Having submitted a report in which he believes he has found hidden meaning which may jeopardize our way of life, he unwittingly finds himself right in the middle of unimaginable danger, trying to escape from those responsible for the killing of everyone in his office - and being accused by everyone else as being the perpetrator. Top notch development of the story line filled with plot twists and turns, accompanied by excellent acting. Though not overly complicated, viewing the movie a second time greatly enhances the experience due to the intelligent depth of the story. A true masterpiece.
