I was about 10 years old when I first saw Metallica's "One" video on MTV.
This was a time when MTV was actually a music channel, with music video's on air all day and all night.
Today, MTV is a completely worthless channel that has nothing to do with music anymore.
But anyway, back in the good old days the "One" video introduced me to real music and made me fall in love with it permanently.
Later on in my life, I learned what the brilliant lyrics of James Hetfield were all about; both the song and the imagery told the tale of a young World War One soldier who lost his arms, his legs, and even his own face during the battle in the trenches. But he lives on, trapped for life in the deepest Hell-bowels of his own mind. These fragments came from a ruthless anti-war film called "Johnny Got His Gun". I never found a copy in shops nearby (I live in Belgium), so I bought the DVD online. I think every old-school Metallica fan like me should see this film, because maybe we have the privilege of understanding the pain and tragedy of this story in a deeper way than the rest of the world.
