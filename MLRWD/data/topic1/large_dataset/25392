I love this movie!  My daughters are completely enthralled with everything princess (especially Dinsey), and I appreciate the jabs that this movie makes at the usually sugary-sweet princess fare.  I can't imagine better casting.  Amy Adams does "wide-eyed innocent" like it's never been done before (even better than Judy Garland in "Wizard of Oz").  Patrick Dempsey is the ultimate skeptic and general naysayer - nothing in life is ever as good as it seems.  James Marsden plays the fairy-tale prince to the hilt, and is hysterical doing it.  After all, "what's not to like" about him?  Timothy Spall as the simpering assistant who finds redemption in the end is hilarious.  Susan Sarandon is completely over the top as the evil queen, and has never been more entertaining!  The best part, even my 2-year-old likes this movie, and the "scary" scenes aren't too much for her to handle.  Both of my girls are now singing songs from the movie, all of which are catchy and endearing in their own way.  I actually laughed out loud when Dempsey's character showed amazement that everyone seems to know the song Giselle breaks into in the middle of Central Park (he knows the song, too?  how come I've never heard this song before?) - after all, isn't that how musicals work?  I am thrilled to add this to my DVD collection, and won't mind watching it every day with my kids.
