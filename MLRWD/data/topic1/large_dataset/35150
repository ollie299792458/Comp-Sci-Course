If you are not familiar with Beth Hart and her music, I have to say that if you purchase this, she will not disappoint.  I have been a big fan of Beth Hart's for years.  However, I am sad to say I have not been able to see this wonderful person perform live.  I Had tickets to see her at a festival in Mobile, Alabama years ago but she cancelled. So I left and bothered not to see any of the other acts.  She was the only one I wanted to see.  Now that I have this dvd, I have not been able to go a day without playing it.  She is absolutely mesmorizing on stage.  There has been no one I have ever seen that has been so powerful, honest and raw (no lip-synching, staged choreography). Just Beth being herself. And she really connects with her audience like no other performer ever has.  I have had her latest cd "Leave the Light On" for a while and since I am not a very religious person, I did not give it a good listen because of some of the religious references in her songs. After viewing her live performance of her new songs, I went back to listen closely to her latest CD.  I could've hit myself for being so narrow-minded and making false assumptions.  It, in my opinion, is her best work yet.  I hope she can make a larger break-through in the U.S..  With a lot of the top 40 being consummed by manufactured "singers" it will be hard, but hopefully she will get the recognition she deserves.  It seems the Europeans already know what a talent she truly is.
