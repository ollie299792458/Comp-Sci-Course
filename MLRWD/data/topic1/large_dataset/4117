The package arrived quickly, courtesy of my Amazon Prime account.  The movies came in a tri-fold case, with a shiny cover sleeve. I like the artwork on the package, simple and not cluttered.  To my surprise upon opening up the package, I found six discs, three are the actual blu-ray movies, and the others are the "Digital Copy" versions.. You need these discs to be loaded up into your computer before you can download them.  I am sure these discs are there as some sort of Digital Rights Management (DRM). I was expecting a leaflet with a code and website to download from, but that just may be my expectation derived from my Downloadable Content (DLC) experiences from game consoles.

The film seemed grainy, the audio however was superb. I dont have a fancy setup, I watch my Blu-Rays using my Playstation 3 connected to my TV via HDMI. It seems that the movie studios are taking a generic approach to the menu options.While there were some animations, it felt very similar to other Blu-Ray menus, which i suppose is fine, kind of bland and boring in my opinion. I really dislike the load new movie previews from the Internet, fortunately if you mash the menu button you can bypass most of these.

The films themselves have aged well, as they still manage to keep me entertained from start to finish. I did not notice any aspect ratio issues, that other reviewers pointed out. All in all a solid product, and an awesome set of movies. I would recommend to anyone who has a blu-ray player, based on my audio experience alone.
