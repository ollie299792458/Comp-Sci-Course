I am referring to the Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy cheap cardboard triple encasing of 0 2454370750 9 80.

Of the more than thousand DVDs we have bought this is absolutely the most terribly stupid boxing I have yet come across!

I had to use a long chemist's spatula to separate the quadruple fold cardboard discs/book holder from the second box it was glued to the inside of.  Then I discovered the perpetually sticky glue was also on the surface of both the Blu-Ray and the DVD discs as well.  They are not on any kind of central plastic retainers but slid into the cardboard sides like the oft scratched cheaply enveloped $1 DVDs sold at Walmart and Dollar stores - ONLY THIS IS MUCH WORSE AS THE GLUE HOLDING THE SIDES TOGETHER GETS ALL OVER THE SURFACE OF THE DISCS LIKE NON-DRYING CONTACT CEMENT!  With care I was able to extract the discs and with a clean micro-fiber cloth polished off the glue on their surfaces leaving them clean and unscratched.  I then used the spatula again to open the sides up enough to accept some plastic DVD/CD envelopes to keep the glue from resticking to the discs but I had to trim off the corners of the envelopes to get them in and stand any chance of extracting them again.

Being really POed about the experience I am posting to prevent this from happening to others.  WAIT UNTIL THIS COMES OUT IN BETTER PACKAGING OR BUY ANOTHER VERSION. I'm 59 and a professional craftsperson who's made thousands of items professionally, not some spastic adolescent.  My description is accurate.
