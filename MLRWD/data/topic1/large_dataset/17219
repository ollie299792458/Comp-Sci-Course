"Monster Squad" is a good movie, if solely for the fact that it combines all the Universal Monsters and a bunch of kids who swear. This is not the kind of movie you would see on the Disney Channel (for good reason) and it hearkens back to a decade I can barely remember, but who cares. It has some great one liners and some modest performances. With memorable characters such as "Scary German Guy" (there is a great holocaust reference in the movie with him that I never understood before when I was 11).

The special features for this 20th anniversaet edition are quite enjoyable. They go through most aspects of the movie including sepcial effects, character makeup and design, I would say the most interesting part is the cast interviews from Duncan Regehr (Dracula), Andre Gower (Sean), Ashley Bank (little 5 year old Phoebe all grown up!), Ryan Lambert (Rudy) and Tom Noonan (Frankie) . I was hoping for more cast interviews (because it is always great to see actors 20 years after the fact getting all misty eyed and nostalgic right along with you).

Bottom of the line: This movie is worth the buy for any kid or adult that grew up on this movie or the Universal Classic Monster movies. I would dub this movie part of the nostalgic, feel-good, where-was-I-then movies. You don't buy this one for academy performances. It does what a good movie should do, especially the ones that have a legacy: they engage and entertain.
