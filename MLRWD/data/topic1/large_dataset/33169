I BEGIN BY WRITING IN ALL CAPS. FANS OF THIS FILM WILL UNDERSTAND WHY AND ITS CRITICS NEED TO BE YELLED AT! I WONDER WHAT FILM THOSE CRITICS WERE WATCHING AND, MOREOVER, ON WHAT PLANET? IF EVER A FILM PRESENTED REASON TO DISREGARD PROFESSIONAL REVIEWERS, THIS IS IT. THEY TOTALLY MISSED THE BOAT ON THIS ONE. ACTUALLY, BEING SO STEEPED IN THE TRADITION OF PRAISE FOR THE ALASTAIR SIM VERSION, I BELIEVE THEY DIDN'T EVEN PERMIT THEMSELVES THE LUXURY OF A TICKET TO JOURNEY, FOR A MOMENT UNBIASED, ABOARD THIS GLORIUS CINEMATIC VEHICLE. I PITY THEM THEIR PREJUDICE, FOR THIS FILM IS BRILLIANTLY CONCEIVED, PERFECTLY CAST, BEAUTIFULLY SCORED AND FLAWLESSLY EXECUTED!
In a quieter but no less enthusiastic tone, let me say that Albert Finney is nothing short of miraculous in the role of this famous Dickens character. His portrayal is definitive. If in any way he's not the Scrooge of the novel, then he's the Scrooge that should have been penned. Indeed, to those who fault the film for deviation from the novel or the times portrayed therein, I say - SO WHAT? The film, after all, is NOT a documentary. It succeeds at the highest level at what it was designed to be - a musical adaptation and engrossing entertainment. Try not getting misty-eyed as Scrooge laments his lost love. Try not playing along with the 'Minister's Cat'. Try viewing the 'Thank You Very Much' scene and not wishing you too were wearing a hat that you could toss in the air.
I had the good fortune to see this movie during the holiday season of its premier year at Radio City Music Hall. I have viewed it yearly ever since. Each and every year and even on my little screen, when Scrooge places Santa's hat on the doorknocker and closes the door behind him, it's all I can do but stand up and cheer. Do yourself a favor and see this movie in its un-chopped, commercial-free entirety. The laser disc, though offering a less than pristine transfer, does include the wonderful musical prelude. I truly hope the film will someday see the light of DVD. It is not just among the best Christmas movies but, rather, one of the best films ever. A thoroughly marvelous production. To its critics, one word - HUMBUG!
