This wonderful film encapsulates all you need to know about Ireland's tragic passage from oppression to liberation to civil war between 1919-1922.  As its brutal counterinsurgency campaign was failing the British were forced to negotiate, and the Irish republicans chose -- wisely, in my opinion -- to accept peace, independence in all but name (Dominion status), and the forfeiture of Northern Ireland rather than continue the revolt in the face of a British promise to wage all-out war.  Although the treaty was ratified with a popular vote majority, the more radical elements of the IRA chose to continue armed resistance against the new goverment.  The movie eloquently shows how little real difference there was, in practice, between the counter-guerrilla operations of the British and those of the Irish Free State; the sense of tragedy is palpable.  Visually the movie is spectacular, rural Ireland at its most beautiful.  Home viewers should be forewarned that accents make the dialog hard to follow at times.  This is a historical drama that will stand the test of time.
