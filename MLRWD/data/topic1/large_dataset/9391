I finally saw this movie and for the life of me can't understand why it is so highly thought of.  When you strip everything away it's just a stoner movie with an awesome soundtrack - the problem is, the film's not's very funny or interesting.  There's the meandering storylines (since everyone is either drunk or stoned through most of the movie I guess we don't need a real plot), the glut of way too many characters whose names you can't even remember at the end of the movie, the weird obsession of the male jocks to pound the butts of younger boys with paddles, the female hazing rituals that sexualize the young freshman girls in uncomfortable ways, and perhaps most importantly, the creation of a false 1976 reality that no one actually experienced. In this world, the students roam free in the high school (with hardly a teacher around), pot and beer are freely available to any underage person who wants them, and hardly anyone in the whole town seems to have a curfew.  As another reviewer noted, Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a far superior coming of age film with a lot more believable situations and sympathetic characters.
