I must say that I went in to this movie with hugh expectations.  Unfortunately, I was extremly let down.  Even though the performance by Steve Carrell is extremely good, and I think he was perfect for the role, it was the plot of the movie that blew it for me from the beginning.

It was hard for me to comprehend how somebody that was still a virgin at age 40, and obviously a person of much integrity, would have very few friends, and the friends he does have are just total meat heads.

From time to time the movie was quite charming.  The scenes with Carrell and his new girlfriend played by the always wonderful Catherine Keener, were interesting to watch, however, the plot always seemed to revert back to the frat boy humor that seems to be prevelant in so many movies today.

There is no way a guy like this would end up engaging in the ridiculous scenarios the movie portrayed.  As far as I'm concerned, I wasn't endeared to Carrell's character for this very reason.

Take away the raunchy shenanigan's and add a little bit more substance, and you've got one heck of an engaging story.

My biggest complaint about this movie is that I just didn't find it very funny.  I've seen these scenes played out before only much better.

Steve Carrell is a funny guy, and a decent actor.  Give him a movie with a more believable plot and he'll pull it off, but in this movie Carell and his cast of idiots seem to just be getting laughs from acting stupid.
