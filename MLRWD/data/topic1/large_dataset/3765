I saw this box on the shelf and thought it was a hardcore horror flick.  Turns out it is a pop - teen kind of horror flick.  I won't be fooled by those box covers anymore.  The movie overall is not that bad, but if I knew what kind of vein it was in before I rented it I wouldn't have rented it.  There are a few places in the movie and at the end credits where the soundtrack is this god-awful pop music crap that I hate and basically ruined the movie for me, I wanted to turn it off the second I heard that first pop song. (one song I believe is by Cake, who I loved with Fashion Nugget, but hated ever since).  The actual thriller music is good.  Real good complex plot twists and a little bit of irony.  There is a Ferris Bueller's Day Off reference (try to find it).  Bon Jovi also stars in this movie and acts out one of his lyrics.  I can honestly not recommend this to anyone over 19, not under 19, I mean OVER.  I'm 22 and I felt like an old man watching these crazy kids run around to their dag-blasted pop music.  Another complaint, and my principal compaint, is the UNRATED added to the box cover of this movie.  There is absolutely no nudity, very little gore, and not a substantial amount of cursing (I can honestly not recall any cursing from the movie, but maybe i've become desensitized), all of which are ingredients in a good horror movie.
