A powerhouse performance by Barbara Stanwyck carries this film noir suspense thriller straight to the end. She plays Leona, a spoiled pharmaceutical heiress who's bedridden due to a hypochondriatic "heart condition". Pampered by her widowed father, she's always gotten everthing she wanted by manipulating her illness to her benefit. She's married to a younger man who's poor but given a good job by her father in his company to keep Leona happy. One night, when she is left alone in her shadowy house, she accidentally overhears a murder being plotted on the phone (her access to the world) and then later discovers it's her own murder being discussed. Frantically, she tries to get help and begins piecing together the events leading up to this moment through flashbacks. Stanwyck is awesome in a performance demanding neurotic hysteria as a hypochondriac who has alienated everyone including her husband and father with her demands and behavior. She should have gotten the Oscar she was nominated for. Burt Lancaster plays the hapless husband who is driven to extreme means to achieve success on his own terms but winds up in over his head and lives to regret it. This was originally a radio thriller by Lucille Fletcher (who also did the film's screenplay) with Agnes Moorehead as Leona. The story is well transposed to the screen and is a nailbiter. The ending is surprising for the time and must have been a shocker in 1948. Under the superb direction of Anatole Litvak, Stanwyck pulls out all the stops as a woman who cried wolf once too often. A real treat on DVD as it looks and sounds fine and a great collectors' item for Stanwyck fans as well.
