Christopher Nolan has followed his impressive mainstream debut, Memento, with a film that once again examines the psychology of manipulation. The sunlit nights of an Alaskan summer distort the sense of time in a more subtle fashion than its predecessor. Al Pacino gives an impressive performance as a cop at ease with the compromises sometimes necessary in his chosen profession. Robyn Williams is the perpetrator of the particularly violent and meaningless murder. It is Lieutenant Dormer, played by Pacino, that the audience sleep-walks along with as the days merge together, and Robyn Williams that proves to be a plausible, accessible and fiercely intelligent "job" for Dormer to complete before the lack of sleep and Internal Affairs catch up with him.
Nolan's direction is accomplished, the setting compelling, and the atmosphere palpable. While remakes tend to lose the full-bodied flavor of the prototype, there seems to be no such concern here (although I haven't seen the Norwegian original). The principals - rounded out by Hilary Swank as a young, dedicated local policewoman - are each utterly convincing in their portrayal of the guiding principals each has set themselves to live their lives by. But there are no black and whites here - sometimes it seems that only the crispness and beauty of the Alaskan scenery (mostly shot on location in Canada) gives us an unambiguous point to steer by. As Dormer's control of the situation slips away, we can feel him being tormented by uncertainty over his own motivations. It is a testament to the strength of the acting that while the final chapter, in hindsight, may seem predictable, it seems anything but as we are inchingly drawn into it, like a dream we wish we could begin with an elusive but much-needed sleep.
