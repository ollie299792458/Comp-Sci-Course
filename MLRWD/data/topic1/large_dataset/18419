What's to be said about this film that has not already been said it's been called controversial,praised by critics and audiences alike,and yet this film is titled "the scariest movie of all time" it earned several oscar nominations.Ellen Burnstyn was nominated Best Actress for The Exorcist(1973),William Friedkin was nominated Best Director, Linda Blair ultimately won for best supporting actress for her role as Megan,the young girl who becomes possed by satin himself.A great film and one of my personal favorites.So the question is how does this film look on Blu?Scanned at a 4K resolution on a 50gb disc in 1080p with an aspect ratio 1.85.1 16x9 The Exorcist has never looked this good in any home meduim until now.It's a big improvement over the previously released dvds.The transfer is very close to the orignal source material,Warner Bros.comes through again in keeping their classic titles true to the film's origanal look.Details are never lacking and theres not a single trace of Dnr(digital noise reduction).Film grain is apparent throughout which adds to the grittiness of the piece.The Exorcist has a very filmic look however if you're looking for this to look anything like Avatar think again.On the audio side there are 2 lossless  tracks DTS HD MA 6.1 on The Director's cut and DTS HD MA 5.1 ON The Orignal Theatrical cut.Both are excellent with plenty of surround activity especally in the rear surrounds this is a pretty beefy soundtrack for a movie from 1973.The ertras are plentiful all are carried over from the orignal dvd release with new exras in HD those include:Raising Hell:filming The Exorcist(a rare behinds the scenes look at the making of this classic with rare footage from the set),The Exorcist locations Goergetown then and now(comparisons between what the city looks like now and how much has changed from 1973),Faces of evil:The differnt versions of The Exorcist(an in depth comparision between the 2000 DIRECTOR'S CUT and The Orignal Theatrical cut),and commentary by William Friedkin.On disc 2 1973 Orignal Theatrical cut,2 commentaries William Friedkin and William Peter Blatty,The 1998 documentary :The Fear Of God:The Making of The Exorcist and much much more.The Exorcist is nicely packaged in a 2 disc digibook form with 38 pages of full color and b&w photos with tid bits on the movie the book has a beautiful gloss finish a nice edition for any Blu-ray DVD collection.So if you're a fan of The Exorcist this is a no brainner or if you've never seen The Exorcist it's worth the buy because now you can see The Exorcist the way it was truely meant to be seen and heard.
