I saw this movie in the theater &amp; I loved it.  They "kept it real"...not ghetto.  The men in my life appreciated the authentic depiction of what goes on in a barbershop...controversy &amp; all.  I enjoyed all the characters, especially Mike Ealy...the brotha is H.O.T! Sean Patrick Thomas---ooooh! ...Eve put it down earnestly &amp; Cedric...y'know, is there anything to say?  He's a master. I most love the special features on DVDs and this one didn't disappoint.  The commentary with the director Tim Story &amp; producers Robert Teitel, George Tillman, Jr., and Mark Brown was HILLARIOUS!  These guys are funny &amp; they did a great job walking us through how scenes were developed &amp; the back story of the actors...didn't know that Isaac Rosenberg is Jane Fonda's son?!
I enjoyed their commentary, their inside jokes, their insight, vision &amp; passion for this movie.  After hearing the commentary, I appreciate more how the actors worked to help keep this movie authentic...and it shows.  I'm going to count this one among the classics!
