I wanted to see this movie because I was living and working in downtown Seattle at the time of these events. I was able to watch a lot of the protests unfold from my office window, and walked through the protests on my way to and from work. I won't quibble with some of the historical inaccuracies - hey, that's movie-making.

But I did want to point out that this is like some bad war movie from the 40's or 50's -- just a bunch of pot cliches and paper-thin characters strung together to try to make a movie out of a very interesting historical event: Angry cop. Pregnant wife. Overwhelmed mayor. Heroic young protesters, debating over who is more courageous and idealistic.

I did enjoy the way they edited in some actual historic footage. Otherwise, this was more like watching someone's film-school mid-term project than an actual commercial movie release. It would have been better if they would have twisted the facts more, and had some UFO's blast downtown Seattle with laser beams or something.
