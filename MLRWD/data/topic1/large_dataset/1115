This is one of the greatest movies of all time.  It's got everything -- action, mystery, suspense, comedy, and a little romance.  The visuals are stunning, the story fascinating, the characters compelling.
Disney's English translation and dub, unfortunately, captures maybe 20% of the power of the original soundtrack.  The dialog is dumbed down, the delivery emotionally flat.  Most unforgiveably, the amazing sound effects of the original have been pushed so far down into the mix that they're often inaudible.  This results in the disconcerting experience of seeing, say, a roaring engine or a massive explosion, but without the accompanying sound.  The sounds effects are almost completely buried in unnecessarily intrusive background music which has been added to the English version.
This is a great movie, enjoyable by people of all ages.  For the best viewing experience, turn on the subtitles and switch to the original Japanese soundtrack.
Six stars out of five for the original movie, minus two for the English soundtrack.
