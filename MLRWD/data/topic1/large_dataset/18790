I came to this miniseries after being a fan of other, later Civil-War dramas produced for TV, North & South and Gettysburg. With respect, my experience of The Blue & the Gray is rather opposite to that of Amazon's reviewer: the battle-scenes, next to those of the more technically advanced films, Gettysburg in particular, seem rather underpowered (although accurate and representative of what happened); while the personal and historical dramas are authentic and compelling. Even that line of dialogue about "sacred soil"--far from being hackneyed--perfectly fits the dramatic and emotional situation in which it occurs. I think the Civil War has been very fortunate in the depictions it's received on film. The Blue & the Gray, despite its modest means or perhaps because of them, is especially good at capturing what mattered to the people of that era, and at showing what happened to them. For that reason, it does seem to me to be the freshest, the most eternally young, of Civil-War movies. By the way, the uncut version is what I watched and it's the one I can recommend.
