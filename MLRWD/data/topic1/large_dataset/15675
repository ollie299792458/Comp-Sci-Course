There was a small window of time, before reality TV and manufactured teen idols, when creators were allowed to create.  One of the offsprings of this archaic golden age was Disney's Gargoyles.

 Walking the path of Batman:  The Animated Series and opening the door for Roughnecks:  The Starship Troopers Chronicles and the like, it stands as the pinnacle of after-school entertainment (or any other type).

 Accessible to children and geared toward an older audience, Gargoyles used epic storylines and a developed cast of characters to keep the attention of its demographic.

 Clean, intricate artwork combined with a powerful score and talented voice actors make this series one that should not be passed up.

 This collection is reported to include all thirteen episodes, uncut.

 With that in mind, "Deadly Force" should still deliver the original impact that got it pulled from syndication and the artwork of the Manhattan skyline in the early nineties' should remain untouched.

 So set aside six and a half hours.  Because once you start, the second season won't come fast enough.  That's the one that will help you ace your Macbeth exam.  It's even better than Cliffs Notes.
