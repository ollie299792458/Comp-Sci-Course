Ok. America now has a high quality copy of Drunken Master available at your local... If you don't have this on DVD, get this one because it's high quality. Big deal if the subtitles and audio tracks get mixed up here and there because we should feel lucky that they were kind enough to release this for purchase at... 
With that said, This is the Greatest Movie of all times. Forget all that Pretentious, Hollywood Oscar nominated ... with Gladiators, Wizard's, Monster Balls, and whatever ... they make and nominate at their ceremonies, because this film blows them all away. 
Why? Because it is the greatest film of all times.
No other picture manages to combine Grace, Beauty, Sadness, Action... all the things Hollywood Producers, Actors, Directors, etc deliberately set out to do so they can win that little trophy... 
Drunken Master is a million times better than all of those films put together.
This is a True work of art that should have been included in The Greatest 100 Movies of all times. It should have been number one on their list!
Well, if the type of movie you like is about people crying and making you want to cry and feel sad and depressed, don't watch this. But if you want to see people cry and go through sadness and pain, but it makes you to laugh, then watch this.
This film is a masterpiece of cinematic brilliance.
Those same top 100 list people didn't even give this an honorable mention! It's too bad because many people will never get to see, or even become aware of this film. 
Oh well. That's their problem and not yours because if you are reading this, then you have become enlightened and should watch this movie if you have never seen it yet.
