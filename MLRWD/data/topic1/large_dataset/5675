I was quite amazed by this series. I enjoy science fiction as well as animation, but only when it is SF based. And, although this is an action series with plenty of violence, that is not what attracts me to this show.

The animation is very realistic, and the stories are on par with movies like Minority Report, I, Robot, The Matrix, Blade Runner, or Johnny Mnemonic. If you enjoy the cyberpunk sub-genre of gritty, near-future SF realism, then you will likely enjoy the Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex series. Yoko Kanno's electronic music is brilliant, and the main title theme gets you right from the start with its eerie, mysterious sound and mix of Russian, English and Latin lyrics. I felt like I was watching a crime and espionage show that was actually set in the future. That alone puts this series far ahead of much of the SF that is out there today.

If you are a science fiction fan who has not tried much Japanese animation, this might be a good series to start with.
