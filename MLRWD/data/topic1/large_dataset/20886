While perhaps a bit much for a true beginner I think most people in decent shape will be able to run with this one. The fact is that at any time you can drop out of the asana and take a break. He even tells you this.
The comments in some reviews about the "touching" are to put it bluntly ridiculous. It is called instructing and I am truly sorry that some reviewers were not able to get by this. Many people have also made comments about the "look" of the video be it about Brian or the students and they have been both positive and negative comments. I ask you what does this really have to do with the instruction of the video? I do not know. It seems off base when the video was not made to be a model review. The true intent of the film is instruction and it does this well.
I do not think you will be let down at all by these videos and if you look at the overwhelming reviews you to will see what an asset these can be to ones workout/practice. Get the DVD cause you may wear out the VHS.
