How did I miss this? Finally the Extended Version with Director Mel Gibson's Commentary, which is well done--you feel like he's sitting in the room watching it with you. By that I mean he does not overload you with commentary, you actually get to watch the movie with him. And it's done in with a good dose of filmmaking knowledge, storytelling expertise and his wonderful sense of humor.

The 2nd Disc has a mesmerizing historical documentary of William Wallace and the beautiful country of Scotland that will make anyone with a slice of Scottish descent--proud. Screenwriter Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson also contribute to the documentary narrative.

Then there's a nicely updated version of the Making of Braveheart with archival interviews and a detailed interview with Screenwriter Randall Wallace that is enlightening.

For me this Special Collector's Extended Edition is a classic...a classic without CGI effects...ah...those were the days. From a personal record of theater viewings that has never been matched by any release since, as well as wearing out two video tape versions, the LOTR series proved that it is best to wait for the commentary extended DVD and this is well worth the wait and another Award in the best DVD of a Movie Classic category.
