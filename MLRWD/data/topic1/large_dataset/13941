I find most "stoner" movies to be too juvenile to bother with.  This is not a typical stoner movie, though, because the leads are not slacker losers, they're intelligent guys (one's an investment banker, the other an aspiring med student) who happen to like to hang out together and smoke dope.  Which, truth be told, is pretty accurate of a lot of twenty somethings today.

The best bits are hilarious.  Watch out for the British twin sisters, the evangelical tow truck driver, and Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser) as a sex crazed drug addled party animal.  The only scene that fell flat for me was the one with the cheetah.  Pointless and not funny.  That said, this is not highbrow humor.  But if this were just a series of frat boy jokes it would have fallen as flat as most other movies of the genre.  What really elevates this movie is the Harold and Kumar characters.  Silly antics aside, these guys are really likeable and have great on screen buddy chemistry.

I don't know why I haven't seen John Cho and Kal Penn in more movies, but the ending makes me hopeful that there will be a sequel.
