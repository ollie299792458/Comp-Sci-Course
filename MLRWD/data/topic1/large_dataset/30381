This is on my list as the hit gift for every boy on my list when he hits his teens!  Months after I got this for a younger cousin, his sisters told me he kept watching it, and he'd pull it out to watch with his friends.  [No, he's not an asocial dangerous nutcase, he's hardworking sensible guy.]  So the next year when he turned 16 and got his driver's license, I got him the soundtrack as his "driving music."  His huge grin when he unwrapped it and saw my note told me he was happy with it!  I have friends and cousins whose boys are getting to the right age to appreciate this, and it's going to each of them.  An added bonus: not only goes this give young men the story of an American icon, it does actually show them what war is like for guys on the ground [a shock for me the first time I saw it, and probably for everyone] AND -- this can really wake up an interest in history.  A couple of cousins have read books on WWII, and done better in history classes since they started to be more interested.  A lot to get -- and give! -- with one present.
