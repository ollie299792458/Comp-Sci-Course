I was a bit surprised to see any negative reviews here, but I guess different people feel differently so I won't get into anything other than why I thought this movie was off the charts!

First, like others, I'd heard all the hype, and just last night my wife brought it in and we watched it...

I can honestly say for my part, with all the awards it got, I was thinking prior to seeing it, could it really be that good?

Well now having seen it, I have to say it definitely is!  I thought the filming was exceptional and the scenery was incredible!  I've traveled a bit in my time on this floating sod of earth and I've always been amazed when in what are referred to as (Third World Countries), the people can have so little and still seem to be happy with life.  Well not all of them but this movie delves into the underside of humanity also and although repulsive and shocking to some, it unfortunately is a reality as well and very graphically depicted in this film.

It jumps back and forth but it is very cleverly put together so that it all makes completely sense as it unfolds.  I don't want to say more and spoil it for those that haven't seen it, but if you have ever wanted to see another country or the country of India, if you can't get there, this is a film that will take you there!  And I thought the acting was superb!

We rented the movie.

I will definitely buy this movie having seen it now and I truly think it is one of the most amazing films, I've ever seen or that has ever been made!

Hat's off to everyone who made this project come to life and it's deserving, (Again in my opinion) of all the praise and then some!
