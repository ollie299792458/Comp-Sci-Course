I walked out of the theate with my then girlfriend and with a straight face predicted that Unforgiven would win Best Picture, and if it didn't, I declared, there was no justice in the world.  She laughed at me and called  me a macho pig and two weeks later I was eating cold pizza alone in a  studio apartment with a sinkful of dirty dishes. Anyway.  Unforgiven is a  perfect combination of script and cast, a movie that never could have been  made even ten years before because Hollywood would not have allowed such a  complete debunking of a genre and because only an older Clint Eastwood  could have pulled off the hero/anti-hero's existential conflict.  Beautifully filmed, written, and acted, Unforgiven finally depicts the west  as it may have been, in razor contrast to Eastwood's previous westerns (all  entertaining, but never long on believability). Until Blood Meridian is  made into a movie (and God I hope that never happens) this is as close as I  imagine you would want to get to the west in the late 1800's, and if you  can take a little knife work and some cold blooded killings, this is a  wonderful movie with many subtle and not so subtle lessons about our common  humanity.
