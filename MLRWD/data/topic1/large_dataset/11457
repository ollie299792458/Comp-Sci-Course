I have seen Big Jake several times over many years and still find it fun.  However, I've always had a real problem with the ending which apparently no one else writing a review even noticed.  Dog and Sam SharpNose are important characters (none of the calamities would have been salvagable without the two of them), yet they are the only two "hero" casualties in the adventure.  That would have been acceptable though not welcome, if their sacrifices had been acknowledged.  I could not believe the ending when it seemed as if everyone was tired of filming so decided to close it down with a happy conclusion and go home and go to bed.  Is it possible there were a few more scenes which were edited out

for some reason?

All the McCandles "boys" walk away happily smiling with absolutely no mention of Dog and Sam who were hacked to death making the happy ending possible.  No one even seems to notice they are dead let alone think of burying them or pausing a moment for reflection/appreciation of their contribution.  Little Jake can be excused --- after all he didn't know them, but there's no excuse for the others --- especially Big Jake who supposedly valued and respected them as companions.

Though not on a par with his movies like The Shootist, True Grit, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, or even Stagecoach, It could have been better if the ending had any heart.
