I never saw this in theaters because everyone's reaction seemed to be that of disappointment. Then it dawned on me, everyone kept telling me it was not as good as 300 or Sin City. I finally rented it and I can honestly say it was excellent. The film from beginning to end was beautifully done; all the visuals were eye candy and fascinating.

I think the film loses the possible merit it could have had because it was marketed so strongly with Frank Millers previous connections to 300 and Sin City. Both of which were very dark stories.

The Spirit is a dark story with a tongue in cheek attitude that does not take itself too serious.

That is what I found so amazing about the film. Frank Miller's ability to capture the gritty action of a crime noir adventure while controlling the cheese factor results in a solid and balanced movie.

I also have not followed any of Will Eisner's original Spirit comics so my opinion of the cast's portrayal of the characters is based solely on their performances within the film. Of which were excellent, especially front man Gabriel Macht's performance as The Spirit.

This is Frank Millers first feature length debut film and I am thoroughly looking forward to his future works.

All in all I would say to approach this movie with an open mind and not to compare it to Sin City or 300. You'll be in for a surprise that is fresh, different, and enjoyable.
