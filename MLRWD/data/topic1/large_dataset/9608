Incredibly bad and on the same level as Autumn in New York which was a Gere film with a similar premise.

The worst parts:

1. No real depth to characters.

2. Over the top acting/behavior during scenes when a person would not normally behave that way in real life.

3. Zero chemistry between Gere and Lane and I mean zero.

4. The first time the characters kissed it was so bad we started laughing. The general sentiment was, "Now? They've chosen this moment of all moments to make out?"

5. Watching Gere and Lane kiss, especially in the driveway scene, was like watching two senior citizens grappling around in the dark. Zero chemistry, zero passion, and actual fumbling. Yeach!

Maybe they should cast Gere with someone he can't stand. At least in An Officer and a Gentleman he and Debra Winger were passionate even if it was only in their dislike for one another off screen. Lane has no sex appeal and her played out hairstyle and drab wardrobe in this film were awful. Skip it!
