Unless you've been living under a rock for the past 12 years, you have seen (or at least know about) "When Harry Met Sally." So, I don't feel I need to comment on the plot of the movie. Suffice it to say: This is the most astute and funny commentary on male/female relationships, friendship and life in general. An extremely funny film with a great (and believable) romance.
The DVD offers some great extras (in addition to the fantastic movie) for When Harry Met Sally fans. The documentary is interesting and funny: Rob Reiner talks about how he acted out the "orgasm scene" (to get Meg Ryan going in the right direction) in front of his mother. And the filmmakers reveal just how much Harry was based on Rob and Sally was based on Nora Ephron. Seven minutes of deleted scenes aren't much compared with other DVDs, but its enough. They're short, funny, and just what you'd expect from When Harry Met Sally.
For me, the best thing about DVDs is the chapter selection -- you can go to a favorite scene without massive amounts of fast-forwarding and rewinding. Having a bad day? Skip to a favorite scene ("baby fish mouth!" does it for me) for a quick laugh. After all, you've seen this movie more times than you can count...
