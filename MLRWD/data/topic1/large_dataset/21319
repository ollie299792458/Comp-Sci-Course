This should be called The Best of Jack Benny and More!  There is so much more, from the now long-banned cigarette commercials, to GE Theatre (you've got to see these, hosted by none other than Ronald Reagan), the Easter Seal Teleparade of Stars, and the Bing Crosby GE Show.  This set is four DVD discs full of early television history; television in its infancy.  Jack's show was basically an early variety show, featuring many stars of the silver screen, and musicians of the day, such as Fred Allen, Eddie Cantor, Bob Hope, Humphrey Bogart, George Burns & Gracie Allen, Johnnie Ray, Danny Thomas, Irene Dunne, Vincent Price, Liberace, Jimmy Stewart, Audrey Meadows, Ernie Kovacs, the Beach Boys, Dick Contino, and so, so, so many more!  We simply do not have programming like this on television today, and that is a shame.

The Jack Benny Program aired on the CBS Television Network in the 1950s and into the 1960s.  In the early days of television programming, many programs, while deemed "regular" programs, did not air weekly.  Jack Benny's show alternated with Ann Sothern in "Private Secretary" for some time in the early years.  I have also purchased what I could of that series through Amazon, and will write a review of that (preview of my review:  BUY IT!  IT'S SO FUNNY!)

Quality of some of the programs sometimes suffers from fifty-to-nearly-sixty year old technology; they did not have videotape back then.  That, however, is all very forgiveable; for what this set lacks in technical aplomb is undeniably more than superceded by the priceless content.  This is a monument and tribute to mid-20th century post-War America and the artists of that period, and is a must-have for anyone who is either knowledgeable of and enjoys early television programming, or someone who wants to learn about the medium and its roots.
