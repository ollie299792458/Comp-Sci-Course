Unless you are a comic book fan, my advice to you is pass over this one. I saw it without realizing first that it was an adaptation of a comic book and I was expecting something Matrix-like. WRONG!

I'm apolitical. I couldn't give a flip either way about the political message that the movie absolutely BEATS you with. However, if you take away the political aspect of the movie, what have you got?!?!

GEEZ, this movie was tedious and boring, not to mention plain STUPID on so many levels I can't even begin to list them. I have to say that at the beginning of the movie I was intrigued. The cinematography is excellent, and at least in the beginning, the characters and dialogue are very interesting and mystifying. But DANG, by the middle of the movie the mask and the wig and the tedious verboseness of "V" became just laughable. Literally. Well, more of a weeping laugh, like is this for real? When will it be over? What time did we start this thing?

Maybe I'm just too old(40). Maybe it's because I'm NOT a comic fan. Maybe it's because I don't give a crap about politics...

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
