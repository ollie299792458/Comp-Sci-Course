I tried to accept it as a stand-alone project, rather than a continuation of the classic "Donnie Darko".  Sadly, this film doesn't work on either level.
  "S. Darko" is a film sorely lacking a plot, clarifying (or even multi-syllabic) dialog, or particularly interesting characters.  References are lifted from "Donnie Darko" and sprinkled on top of what really is a scrap of story.  Whereas every element in DD served a purpose and left you genuinely wondering why and how the Tangent Universe existed, what is reality or fantasy, and had a likeable cast and was filmed with sly humor, SD is a ragtage assemblage of one-dimensional characters that drift in and out but explain nothing. Nothing becomes clearer on repeated viewings or from the Director's commentary. Being confusing or writing a poor screenplay is not the same as being cryptic or clever.
  The film itself has some impressive scenery of Utah at its disposal, but otherwise the special effects and sets are of low quality. As mentioned, the dialog is just awful. The mid-90's timeframe is not utilized as was 1988 so successfully in DD.  In fact, this could take place in any small town.  Instead, we're in "Conejo" (Rabbit) Springs, Utah, where there's an auto repair shop named "Frank's" and a reappearance of the bunny mask.  All these winks to the original deserve better explanation than just being random placements. There's a character "Iraq Jack" who looks vaguely like Jake Gyllenhaal, and he, along with Samantha, are the only ties to the original that could have been developed in a way to give this film a point.  But they're not.  The much-discussed "twist" is neither shocking or effective in setting up any conflict or resolution.  At the end, one is left wondering not "What happened", but "why did someone go to the effort of making a 100+ minute film where nothing makes sense"?
  Save your cash, folks.  If you're morbidly curious, rent it.
