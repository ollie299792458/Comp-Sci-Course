I am a graduate student studying for a PhD in History.  My dissertation is on the French Revolution, so I know many of the key events that took place during this momentous moment in history.  I understand that this video is truly made for 'the masses,' and not for scholars, but there still a few things the History Channel ignores.  First and foremost, there is no mention of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy.  This key document which unfolds into its own episode within the Revolution, and has recently been cited as one of the turning points of the Revolution where 'things started to go bad,' is not even discussed once- neither is the Marquis de Lafayette.  The historiography also tends to focus too much on specific people such as Robespierre and Marie Antoinette, who were of course important in terms of the unfolding of events, but other important figures could have been discussed more.  All in all it is an informative, well documented production that will most likely leave the viewer feeling much more informed about the event that ushered in the modern era.
