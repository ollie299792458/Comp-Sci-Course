I can't join the other reviewers in their praise for this movie.  Tom Gries attempts, through character development, to present a "thinking man's" movie, but winds up with a s-l-o-o-w moving "entertainment" movie.  My take: STORY (2*) This is merely an extended diary of what Will did yesterday, today, and tomorrow.  Although the events do have some relevance to each other, they are presented in a slightly dis-jointed fashion that keeps the movie from segueing smoothly from scene to scene.  I was also uncomfortable with the finish and it's failure to complete the minor tensions in the plot (ie what will happen to Hackett and her son? How does Ben Johnson's character respond to the events?  Has Will Penny retained his honor (most important trait for any western hero?, etc.)) ACTING (2*): Heston carries this film with an understated performance, closely followed by Hackett as the love interest.  Johnson is his usual solid self.  All others are forced to the point of caricature, particularly Donald Pleasence.  The result is an ensemble that I am not emotionally invested in.  CINEMATOGRAPHY (3*): I have pan-and-scan, but even in wide screen this is an average presentation from an artistic viewpoint, with very little sense of big-sky.  MUSIC (4*): The opening theme is superb western movie music, the rest forgettable.  For Heston-Hackett fans, go for it, otherwise not recommended.
