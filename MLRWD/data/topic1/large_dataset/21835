When Robert De Niro appears in a film this bad, it seems like a cry for help. Maybe De Niro is ready and willing to retire, but lacks the financial security. Driven to desperation, he might be jumping on any lame script that crosses his desk. I'm reminded of the twilight of Orson Welles' career, during which the once-heralded filmmaker and actor resorted to TV spots and cartoon voiceover work to pay the bills.

The story, such as it is: A couple (Greg Kinnear and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) lose their son (Cameron Bright) in a car accident shortly after his eighth birthday. A mad scientist (De Niro) appears out of the woodwork and talks them into letting him clone their late son. When their newly-cloned son reaches the age of eight, all hell breaks loose...or it would, if this were a better movie.

Perhaps in an effort to keep a PG-13 rating or perhaps due to a lack of imagination, the "hell" that is unleashed amounts to nothing more than naughty behavior and bad dreams. By the time the evil clone ups the ante, the story has dragged on uneventfully for far too long, piling improbability on improbability.

I'm not even going to get into the questionable science at the core of the film's premise.

My advice to you: Watch _The Omen_ and _The Omen II_ instead of this garbage. They aren't exactly great movies either, but they're in a similar vein (innocent looking caucasian boy is actually evil incarnate) and they're more entertaining by far.

My advice to Robert De Niro: Unless you want audiences to wonder why you were ever considered an A-list actor, you'd better stay away from stinkers like this in the future.
