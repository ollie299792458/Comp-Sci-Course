For any Pacino or gangster flick genre fans, this movie is a must own. I wouldn't say its Pacino's best film hes ever been in, but to me Tony Montana was his best role and one of the best film characters in history. Pacino burns up the screen with his trademark intensity and bravado in a way only he can deliver.

The movie itself involves the tale of the rise and fall of a man. Pacino starts out as a Cuban immigrant with nothing and eventually becomes the druglord of Miami. Of course once he makes it to the top the only way left to go is down...and down hard he goes. Tony is the classic anti-hero; hes the "bad guy" but you can't help but root for him throughout the movie. There's something in Tony's character that anyone can admire whether its his ambition, honesty, boldness...or over the top accent. We are left to realize that Tony's way of life is the only way out for someone of his status to be in his mind a success. Its either living the thug life or breaking his back washing dishes for minimum wage.

Scarface will strike you with its authenticity and realism in a way most movies can't. It also has some of the most memorable lines and scenes you'll ever see. Just hands down a great flick.
