How this movie got so bad reviews is beyond me. Apparently everyone who didn't enjoy the film doesn't like the story of the Alamo. The film is pretty much historically acurate. From what I know of the main characters of the film, they are definately portrayed well by Billy Bob Thorton, Dennis Quaid, and Jason Patric.  The Alamo has the qualities of old epic films from the 50's and 60's, which is a great thing to see in the new century. I think another thing that really makes it so great is that Davy Crockett isn't the main character. Unlike all the other older films based on the Alamo. It's split between Crockett, Bowie, Houston, and Travis.  Quaid makes a great Sam Houston, acts kinda crazy in a suttle way.  Patric does awesome job as Bowie, sorta mysterious in a way, with a past that is not quite clear in the film.  Thorton as Crockett, acting as if he really doesn't like living up to his legend, but does anyways. It's a shame this film didn't do that well, cause it deserves all the acclaim as other films with 100 million+ box office success. If you're expecting a western, it is not.  One of the main problems I've had with other films on the Alamo.  They tried to hard to be a western film. The Alamo is a peroid piece about soldiers coming to terms with the inevitable, they are all alone and must fight for what they believe in. Texas.
