Having grown up in a family where my father's substance abuse problem was a daily issue, and where often times our own lives were threatened by the destructive consequences alcoholism can bring (along with hunger and  desperation), watching "Angela's Ashes" was no easy task.  Many  times, reminded of the feeling of hopelessness I once experienced, I had to  take a deep breath due to the stirring of emotions the movie was affecting  in me - how could such an accurate and detailed account of my life be put  into the big screen without my previous consent?  I consider this movie a  masterpiece (the acting is unique), but those who have survived alcoholism  in their own families and who have, at any particular point in their lives,  just "gone through life without the feeling of being alive, and just  moved on out of stubborn determination when nothing offered any hope"  will be able to appreciate this movie to a deeper level.  Frank McCourt,  you are a survivor, and you've done a terrific job growing up as a young  lad, going against all the odds, obstacles and blows life inflicted on you.  Many will benefit from your courage to put in writing the narrative of  your deepest sorrows, frustrations, dreams and ambitions -  Alan Parker's  directing skills kept your narrative honest, and the final product only  falls short when compared to life itself!
