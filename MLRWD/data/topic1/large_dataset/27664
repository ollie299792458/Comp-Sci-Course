Kristin Scott Thomas has long been a favorite actress to watch, a friend describes her simply as "compelling." I loved this movie! Ms. Scott Thomas embraces the role with intelligence and keen insight. She is multilingual, speaks flawlessly in French, wears no make-up in the film, and conveys most of her inner emotions through grey blue eyes and kinesics. The verbal brevity of her character, Juliette, sustains the dark family secret that resulted in her becoming a pariah, shunned by family, friends and colleagues... imprisoned for 15 years, leaving the viewer patiently awaiting any tidbit of information. The movie's title and premise is centered around the unwavering, yet cloudy relationship with her younger sister, the only family member willing to give her shelter. The viewer is chomping at the bit to know the secret, but the pace of the film allows one to comfortably wait it out as you follow her travails. She shines in her performance as a newly released inmate handling a demeaning position at work, dealing with a hostile brother-in-law, a new social interest, and an uncomfortable living situation. The viewer is drawn in immediately to her tremendous strength and despair, waiting for the unveiling of her past and how it will play on the present and future. No more information or it would take away from the restrained suspense! A fantastic movie, subtitles are not even noticed, shortly after the initial scene, a difficult car ride home, with the sister she has loved so long...
