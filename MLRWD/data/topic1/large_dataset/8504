When one considers director John Frankenheimer's career, it's almost a wonder he was ranked up there with other top names of his time like Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorcese; because for as many classic hits that he turned out (THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, THE TRAIN, BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ, GRAND PRIX & BLACK SUNDAY), there were just as many stinkers.  Anyone remember FRENCH CONNECTION II, 52 PICK-UP and a particularly bad monster movie called PROPHECY?  His 1996 remake of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU was so bad, I concluded then and there that Marlon Brando should never again be in front of the camera!  Perhaps if RONIN had been released a couple of years later, Frankenheimer's final swan song would not have been the forgettable REINDEER GAMES.

Through all of its tense spy thriller action and several genuine car chase scenes, the viewer hardly feels cheated by never knowing what's inside the mysterious case (a-la PULP FICTION) that the team of mercenaries, lead by Robert DeNiro, is after.  Jonathon Pryce plays a chilling, frightening role as Seamus, a rogue Irish terrorist hell-bent on retrieving the case for himself.  Hard to believe this guy is a song-and-dance man, also.

Hands-down, RONIN is one of the most intelligent action spy thrillers ever made; a film that easily puts the more popular genre of DIE HARD and LEATHAL WEAPON movies to shame.
