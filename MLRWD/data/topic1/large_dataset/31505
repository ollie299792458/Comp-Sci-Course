Speechless!  That is how Urbania left me.  The frenetic first half, surrounding the plot with tales or enactments of urban legends, leaves us a little confused about what is real and what isn't.  It all comes together during the last half, and boy, does it hit you hard!  Dan Futterman sizzles in this film.  His acting nuances, tiny facial expressions, and emotional explosions are the stuff of great acting!  Where has he been hiding??  The movie must be seen twice so that the sheer brilliance of the plot lines can be rediscovered (there's no cheating by the director to get to the surprising twist at the end), the super-16 saturated colors and the scene color schemes that add emotional hue to each "story" are mezmerizing.  Even the cameo actors approach their characters with care and passion--so much so that they pop into your head days later. This film is haunting. Futterman is utterly believable (and this MUST be the best acting of his career), and the not so tidy ending leaves us wanting more (but it doesn't just stop--there IS some resolution and hope at the end).  Rarely have I seen such powerful images that they stayed with me for days.  This film is one of the best of 2000; others may not have appreciated the story, but there is so much more going on in this film.  This movie definitely deserves more credit than it has gotten.  One can only hope that it is rediscovered soon!
