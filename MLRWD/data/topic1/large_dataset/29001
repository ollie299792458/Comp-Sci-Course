Next to Batman: the Animated Series, Batman: the Brave and the Bold is my favorite cartoon series based on the character. I tune in every week to see the new episode and am always wowed about how surprisingly great the show is. When the show first came out on individual volumes, I waited until a complete season would eventually come out. To my dismay, instead of releasing a Complete Season 1 Collection, Warner Home Video only released the first 13 episodes as Season One, Part One. Why couldn't they just release the entire season? My best guess is so Warner could collect more money from releasing two volumes. Once I got over that, the real thing that made me angry was that there are no extras of any kind on this set. No creators commentary, no behind the scenes footage, nothing. Sigh, I can only hope that they'll release something for Part Two. Anyways, the actual episodes given are quite good. Although this is only the first half of the season, this set ends on a high note with the episode "Game Over for Owlman!" The DVD transfer is also quite good with no scratches or cel dirt visible. The sound is also clear and crisp. It's obvious that Warner aimed this set towards younger kids and wanted to cash in quickly. Overall, this DVD is really only for die-hard Batman fans and it's unlikely that Warner Home Video will release a complete Season 1 nor a complete series. Fans can only hope for future volumes to have more extras.
