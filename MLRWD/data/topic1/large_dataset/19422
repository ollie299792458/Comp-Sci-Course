First of all, let me say two words... "Point Break". Anyone see that movie? I thought the plot was too close to Point Break's plot, only, instead of surfboards, it was street machines. 
Anyhow... the movie definitely fit the name. Ive seen reviews which totally trashed the movie. Isnt it odd, the movies that get trashed by so called critics, always seem to have a great following? I think Paul Walker did a great job in his role, even though I think he was trying to portray a cross between Keeanu Reeves and Ryan Phillippe. Vin Diesel... perfect in his role as well. I mean, you couldnt go wrong with a guy named Diesel in a movie involving street racers. He delivered a nice little monologue which will probably become one that goes down in the books as a favorite... when he preached to "Brian" about winning by an inch or a mile, winning is still winning. Tons of action, and lots of high tech systems in the vehicles featured made this a definite winner for the guys. The hotties in it seemed to help too. The only thing wrong with the movie was the over use of brand names being used, and the fact there were only 3 american cars in the whole flick... the Red F-150 Lightning that "Brian" drove around in, the Charger that "Dom" suped up to over 900 horses under the hood, and the police vehicles. I definitely dig the ending as well. I wont spoil it hopefully, but I will say this... I agree with "Brian", he owed "Dom" a 10 second car. As far as anything else is concerned, its a DEFINITE MUST SEE!
