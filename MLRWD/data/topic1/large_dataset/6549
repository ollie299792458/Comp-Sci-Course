I saw this movie in the theater with my church youth group way back in my early teens.  After the movie, while we were all loading back into the church van, our pastor walks up wearing an eye patch.  Now that was classic!  Out of this trip to the movies, I became hooked on all things Stephen King.  Today, I own all his books in hard back and all the videos made from his works.  I hope that lends some credibility to me when I make the statement "This is one of the best Stephen King films".  Corey Haim is excellent as Marty (a wheel chair bound pre teen),  Gary Busey is hilarious and steals the show as Uncle Red (who builds Marty a wheel chair that is faster than my car). Everett McGill plays the pastor and the turmoil of his character is evident and well protrayed.  The special effect are very good considering the time period, with the ending sequence when the werewolf is killed still among the best of all werewolf movies.  Not very scary, but a very good story and well acted.  There are some scenes that give away who the werewolf really is and it doesn't take a keen eye pick up on these.  This predictibility is the only major draw back to a pretty solid film.  Very much worth picking up.
