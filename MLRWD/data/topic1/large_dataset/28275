This film has multiple levels of involvement for everyone. Following the playwright's original intent (via the DVD's special features), it's much more a commentary or observation on British life and society over the decades as anything else. It's obviously directed square at Eton College, but for my money, doesn't ever go overboard. Yes, they had fags, young boys who did things at the behest of the older boys, but they are not portrayed as being at all abused. Yes, they caned each other, but the film does not make it sound anything more than the kinds of punishments that are meted out by judicial systems to adults later on in their lives, in other words, life at Eton (and other similar schools) is really all just a metaphore for actual later adult living.
The visuals are fantastic, the dialogue thoughtful. The characters are rather stereotyped, but that is quite necessary I think. The film is most certainly not a gay film per se, but does clevery allow that society has gay folk and they must play a part. Bennett is gay, but that really has nothing to do with his moody presence. He wants too much from his culture before he is due, much like today's youth. Harcourt, his lover, is fancifully innocent of all this. Characters like the hated Fowler are all too real and in fact are the most honest of them all. Barkley portrays what I think is much more realistic, a prefect who wants others to trust him and he would never betray anyone. All in all, a great movie, a classic of British film in my opinion.
