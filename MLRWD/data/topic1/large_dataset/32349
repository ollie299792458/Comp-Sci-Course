For those of you who enjoy time travelling back to a simpler time, but haven't been able to find out how, then Lost In Space, Season 3 is the DVD package for you.

Sure, the SFX are cheesy, the plots simplistic, and there is an "Oh, Gosh Darn!" Serial Sensibility about it, but therein lies it's charm.  It's classic 1960's TV.  However, for those of you males who are the demographic known as the "Baby Boomers" there is a whole new way to look at it.  Remember when Penny was an "older woman" and her sister Judy was, well ... hot ... but an adult...  And "Mrs Robinson"... :) wasn't even on the radar?  Well guess what?  Forget about the girls...  Mother Robinson is now a "Younger Woman" -- and she's a fine speciman of a female at that.

This is great TV, and something that you can watch with your kids.  The serial format is a slice of Cinematic History that all can enjoy.  And when you see your young sons developing a crush on Penny, well, you can marvel at how some things never change.
