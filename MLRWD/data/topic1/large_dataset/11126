I give this 4 stars,simply because of originality. It is an 'underdog' movie..with an ending such as 'Seabiscuit', but

not quite like 'Million Dollar Baby'. The thing I like here, as in 'Seabiscuit' is the movie is based on a true story.

I am not old enough to remember Max Baer, but following boxing over the years I picked up a little here and there. Jim Braddock

played by Russell Crowe, ultimately has a date with Mr. Baer, It's how he gets there that makes up the story. Very moving, very real, and a little emotional. At the showing of this movie I went to there were a lot of young people. I had read a local newspaper critics review before I went and the speculation seemed to be would the younger crowd attend this movie , since it is set in the depression? Well, seems to me the answer would be yes. They will see a very well done human interest story about the depression and what it did to so many Americans, and how , we as a nation overcame that to become even stronger. Ron Howard does an excellent job as usual. It's hard to believe that 'little Opie' has developed into such a fine director. But that he is. This will be a good movie to purchase.
