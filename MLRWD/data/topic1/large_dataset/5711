I'm not a sports lover (yeah, yeah - I'm a girl), but I know a little bit about the business of baseball, and I really enjoyed this film.  From understanding how budgets were (are?!) traditionally managed to seeing an underdog team use their brains and savvy to get (close to) the top, it was a refreshing take on how things are in professional baseball.  With realistic humor, some tenderness (especially between Pitt and his daughter), some hard-line business (letting players go is remarkably unemotional, which is both admirable and heart-wrenching at the same time), and some interesting math/economic theory, I found this movie really grew on me.  I admit:  When it ended and I turned it off, I thought, "Meh.  It was okay; it held my attention; it was entertaining."  But as time went by, I found myself thinking about all of the components more and more, and they really added up to more than the sum of their parts.  It grew on me - and I even watched it a second time to see what I'd missed the first time through.  Stellar performances by Pitt and Hill; Seymour Hoffman was a little under-utilized - I would have liked to see a little more from his character's perspective (but admittedly, that wasn't what the movie was about).  Recommended.
