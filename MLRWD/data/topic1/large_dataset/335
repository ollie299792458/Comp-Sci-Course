Oh John~

33 years after Pink Flamingos you made this movie A Dirty Shame.
Poor John I know you meant well, to shock us but:
Darling John it's all been done before ~ by you!

I just bought this movie 5 years after it was released.
I had wanted to buy it but I had forgotten about it
Then saw it on sale and thought what a buy.
My parnter and I was so excited for it to arrive.
When it did we sat with snacks and were ready to roar.

John, John, John!
When does your adolescent sexual obsessions end?
It's just not funny at all anymore.
I felt like a 20 year old being entertained by a 5 year old.

It's all been done and this type of movie is Jaded.
Your films like this must be put out to pasture.
Before you waste our time filming one ~think to yourself~
"Have I done this before?" Yes, a million times.

We didn't laugh, weren't shocked, not amused
And certainly not entertained at all.

Divine, rest her soul, was the superstar of your films!
We loved your commentary on Mommie Dearest
And many other wonderful things you have done
But no more of this garbage please.

It's A Dirty Shame we wasted our time & money on this.
