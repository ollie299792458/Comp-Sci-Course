I love this movie, even as butchered as it was, and the new DVD with the restored film makes it even better. The new film score, however, was too placid, pastel for my taste. Some mod to the original score, take out the "sing along" and the "ding a ling", but leave the music might have been better. I still hum the original score as I watch the movie.

Some other minor "nit picking".

 The French never deployed lancers to Mexico during their intervention. The French cavalry consisted of Chasseurs d' Afrique (very tough, very experinced from ops in North Africa), and provisional regiments of hussars and chassers a cheval.

There was also a mounted etachement of the Foreign Legion.

Also, no French African colonial infantry deployed to Mexico. The only black African unit was a Sudanese battalion provided by the Kedive of Egypt.

 5000 rounds for 48 rifles is little more than 100 rounds a man. For such an extended ops, I would have figured more, especially for a level action breech loader like the Henry.

 Finally, the M1848 12pdr Mountain Howitzer couldn't elevate over 10 degrees.

  Just some nitpicking on a very fine movie. I also liked the documentary and Senta Berger's description of the movie stars as a collection of "manly men" with egos.
