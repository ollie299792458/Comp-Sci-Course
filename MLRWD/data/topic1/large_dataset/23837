This is the first time I submit my review to a movie.

If I can give a rating of NEGATIVE 5 star, I would. This movie is beyond terrible. I have not watched the the previous 2 Ong Bak movies, and judging by this one, I can't see how much better the previous twos can be. This movie is almost like an unintentional comedy.

First, the story is terrible. The movie is very slow. The first hour of the movie is just wasting time. We all know the reason to watch it is because it's a Thai martial arts movie. Therefore, I can accept a terrible script if there were plenty of good fighting scenes. Unfortunately, there isn't any. The final fighting scene is slow and unimaginative.

People are comparing the main actor, Tony Jaa, to Jacky Chan and Jet Li. Well, that is an insult to Jacky Chan and Jet Li. Jacky Chan's movies are like street-fighting style, while Jet Li's movies are more classic martial arts style. Tony Jaa is neither. The speed of the fighting action is really no comparison.

To me, the best of classic martial art movies are Jet Li's "Once Upon a Time in China" collection (the first one is the best) and "Fist of Legend", although his first movie "Shaolin Temple" is also very good, and Donnie Yan's IP Man collection (1 and 2). If you enjoy street-fighting style, then you will like many of Jacky Chan's movies. Watch those, and you will see how inferior Tony Jaa really is.
