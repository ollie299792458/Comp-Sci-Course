This movie is all about Jenna, a married waitress who just found out she is pregnant. Unlike most expectant mothers, she is completely undone when finds out she is pregnant.
Part of the reason she is upset is her husband is a psychotic bully named Earl,who beats on her,mentally and physically and watches her every move.

Part of the reason she is upset is her husband is a psychotic bully named Earl,who beats on her,mentally and physically and watches her every move.
She was secretly saving up money to run away and now that she is pregnant, she is worried she will be stuck with Earl forever and that he will abuse the baby as well.

The only semi - good thing about her life is working at the diner, where she is the pie czar. Jenna has this uncanny knack for making the most heavenly pies,In fact whenever
she is feeling blue she dreams up a new one in her head.
Even grumpy old Joe ( played wonderfully by Andy Griffith) who is very picky about what he eats ,adores her pies.They find out they are both Aquarius's and become very good friends.(The part where he reads her horoscope to her,is hilarious and touching)
She also has a romance with her OBYN Dr, the very caring and very married Dr, Pomatter.This was a little disturbing and weird, because they are both married and he is her baby Dr. But I couldn't really hate either one of the them, because her husband is a scuzzball and her Dr. is so so nice ...looking.
Her 2 best friends, who work at the diner ,Dawn, and Becky , feel bad about her situation and buy her a pregnancy journal. She begins to write letters to the baby, about how her life is going, and how scared she is to be a mother.
The movie has really great ending , but If you want to know what happened ,you will have to rent it for yourself.

Things I liked about it
the little montage's with pies, I wanted to stick my hand through the TV screen and take a piece or two. These pies are the most delectable looking desserts I have ever laid eyes upon (esp the cherry pie)
Dawn,Jenna's waitress friend, who has a cute little romance on the side
The lighting is very bright and cheery
Andy Griffith and Keri Russel(Felicity) are back - I have missed them both
Complicated and believable character's who act a lot like us
Their waitress outfits
The dialog
Becky, the other waitress friend who is always whining about her boobs being crooked.
Very uplifting if you are going through a rough time
