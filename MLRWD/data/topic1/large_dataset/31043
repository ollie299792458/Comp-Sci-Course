Based on a memoir by British journalist Lynn Barber, An Education is the story of a 16 year old girl living in 1961 London with her traditional middle-class parents.

Smart and witted Jenny, who speaks French, plays cello, and has just won a scholarship to go to Oxford envisions life on her own terms. Before she meets David, that is.

David, a 35 year old charmer, takes her to concerts and restaurants, art auctions and Paris, easily seducing her out of her dream. And when he proposes marriage, she accepts him, more than willing to forfeit her education for the glamorous life he seems to be offering her.

There is a catch though, as David is not who he pretends to be, and Jenny is, unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, forced back to redefine her life by herself.

Despite the dark undercurrent of deceit, An Education is an enchanting story about falling in love and growing up, played with charming conviction by Carey Mulligan, who received a best actress Oscar nomination for her role.  As Colin Firth, my favorite nominee in the Best Actor category this year, put it, An Education is an evocative reminder of "how it felt to be sixteen and believe we had all the answers, when we didn't even know the questions."

I agree.
