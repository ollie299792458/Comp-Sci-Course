First, I didn't hate this movie.  This summary won't contain spoilers because it's worth seeing if only for the acting.  I am very big fan of Kristen Scott Thomas.  Her work in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCUO6Q">I've Loved You So Long [Blu-ray</a>]was Oscar-worthy.  Her acting here is no-less perfect, but the script she is working suffers from a lack of common sense.  The story of French Jews deported into the hands of Nazis is worth telling, but the way it's done here is awkward and fragmented.  The present day mystery angle, where Thomas comes in, is also interesting, but the writer delved into scenes that truly wore on my patience.  For instance, when she is trying to track down a certain character in present day New York City, she has to take a cab from address to address to address trying to find who she is looking for.  Why could she have not used a telephone and saved herself the time?  Also, she has to fly all over the world to see some people, where she could have just done it either on the phone, e-mail, etc.  If the mystery portion of the film was set pre-Internet, than maybe I could buy more of this.  Also, when a group of characters make a discovery in an apartment, children are present in a moment where no adult in their right mind would allow them to be.  It was quite ludicrous.  So while this film gets high marks for acting and cinematography, don't expect to love it - and DO expect to roll your eyes quite a bit. 2.5 out of 5.
