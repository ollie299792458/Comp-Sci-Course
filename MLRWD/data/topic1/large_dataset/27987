This was precisely the right film for lifting WW2 American morale.  Bogey vs. the Nazis?  Nothing better to drum up patriotic fervor.  But its much better than that.  This film set out to distinguish between the truly multi-ehnic composition of allied forces and the truly ethno-centric character of the Nazi national identity.  Granted, there was still a great degree of bigotry among allied troops, but this viewer believes that WW2 was the historical point where racist attitudes began to crumble.  I point out the touching scene where Tambu and Waco learn about each others' homes and find common ground even in such a God-forsaken situation.  I still get a little bleary-eyed when I view that!  That Nazi pilot is quite a "nasty"(and something of a stereotype). Seeing a P-51 as a '109 with oversized black crosses made me squirm.  And that armored beauty Lulubell?  She's a true "land battleship".  What a fitting symbol of America's early entry into the war.  M3s weren't the best of tanks, but, like our early wartime aircraft, they were all we had until American engineering and production settled -in.  I recommend the repop of Sahara staring Jim Belushi.  Its almost word-for-word true to the original and nearly as well produced.
