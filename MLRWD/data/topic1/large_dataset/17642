Loved this little filme by director Diane Cresco about a friendship between two deeply religious female teachers - one Jewish and one Muslim, but both agreeing to arranged marriages.  Although everyone around them [the principal of the school, students, their families] views their relationship as somewhat unsettling or unnatural, the women prevail in their close connection.  It is a sweet film proving that shared experience is what truly matters, not labels and politics.  As the women go on their quest for a family-approved husband we see them go on some hilarious dates and meet several amusingly awful prospects and sometimes get frustrated and hopeless - turning to brief scenes of rebellion before ultimately choosing to stay true to their tradition.

Zoe Lister-Jones and Francis Benhamou are perfectly cast, no action seems like a stretch, they fit into their respective characters with grace and ease.  Moreover, the women are strong lead characters - much unlike women's roles in romantic comedies where all they do is whatever their man wants (or whatever will get them a man).  Rochel and Nasira choose their own fates, despite having them arranged.  They make the decision to follow the tradition of arranged marriages and then they go on to decide who they will marry.  Arranged in a wonderful showcase of friendship and love without boundaries or prejudice.  I highly recommend it.
