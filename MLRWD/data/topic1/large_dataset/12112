From the opening scene to the muted (audio) capture of Mr. Pink in the final scene, this movie demands your attention. The cast is drop-dead perfect. Tarantino has written and directed a minor masterpiece.  No,  Citizen Kane it ain't. Nor does it try to be. What it is, is a well told  story of a group of (supposedly) professional felons who have a rat amongst them. Michael Madsen is flat out scary as an ex-con with a bad  attitude. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Chris Penn are equally effective in  their roles.  Steve Buscemi, however, steals damned near all of his scenes.  ("Why do I have to be Mr. Pink?") Even the voice of Stephen  Wright as the radio DJ is perfect. It's hard to believe that a debut film  by an unknown (at the time) director could pack this much wallop and star  power. 'Pulp Fiction' is a great film but it still can't match  this one  for sheer power and energy. As for the DVD transfer, good job!  Two  formats, great sound, and extra goodies makes it a worthwhile addition to  your collection. (That is, if you LIKED the movie.)
