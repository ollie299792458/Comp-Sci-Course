If you are like me then you can't resist a good spy film; especially if my saint, Val Kilmer, appears in it!  The film doesn't really follow the storyline of the books or the series, with Roger Moore.  If you are nostalgic about the series then this probably isn't the best film for you.  The film itself is a blend of action, romance and comedy at times.  The stars of the film; Val Kilmer (Heat) and Elizabeth Shue (Hollow Man), have a genuinely believable romance that leaves any Val Kilmer fan wishing that they were Elizabeth!  As for the Russians in the film; they add a refreshing edge which reminds us of how corrupt the World can be.  The film follows the life of a thief who's only aim is to make $50 million, any way he can, and he uses the names of Catholic Saints to hide his trail.  Meanwhile in a small corner of the World, Dr. Emma Russel has just discovered a scientific Phenomenon.  The Russians want her discovery and they are willing to pay whatever and kill whoever it takes to get hold of it.  The Saint then gets caught up in a web of Russian Maffia, intigue and love.  When you have seen the film as many times as I have you learn to love each Saint for all their different qualities!
