A very famous novelist,probably the most or one of the most well known in the u.s. if not the world,and he's
unearthed in his novels,things about the legal profession we really dont want to know at times,in which all kinds of professional elements in society,are paid off and manipulated in all kinds of ways,so at the end of the trial we really dont know what's true or not,guilty or innocent,or that human nature is not always displayed at its best. The problem is not so much money or the system,but some bad people...and those elements are at play here. Supreme court choices also bear this problem in mind. Very often people put up a candidate,for a choice,simply for his views on abortion or what have you,and at times they may use the word conservative...but usually pro life...and in nomination procedures we hear this more than anything else...of course i find this a way that crass electioneering really interferes in the political process...and a reason why good vetting(a word i think used in this film)is necessary in the selection of the overall viability and good of a candidate...we have supreme court assassinations...and at one time abortion medics were assassinated...and endangered. So i find this a plausible storyline and there are all kinds of elements the writer throws in about presidential politics,the fbi bombs...which is just like a grisham novel we want to root for someone like a sports fan...and are left with many unsavoury characters...except for the julia roberts character which is why she was choosen and she in fact is exiled...what is this writer Grisham trying to say in a very shakespearean kind of way...however he is known as a page turner kind of writer but someone in the know...the story is fabricated(another disquieting word in this novel)about the legal system...its not really a julia roberts type film since the author's plot is the real hero or heroine,and the characters are for the most part blowing in the wind reacting to circumstances...that's why the Roberts character holds my interest,and characters like her hold my interest in life...the other characters in this film.....
