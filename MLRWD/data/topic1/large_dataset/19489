Creature from the Black Lagoon....few films have a name that nearly everyone in the U.S. hasn't heard of, or wouldn't recognize a small plastic figurine if they saw it, and with good reason.
This movie was cutting edge when it was made. It's production values were phenomenal, and the DVD is extraordinary.
The film follows a group of scientists exploring the untamed reaches of the Amazon. The find a secluded lagoon where they hope to find fossils of the 'gill man'. Well folks, they find more than the bargained for when a living gill man finds them, and decides they're not leaving the lagoon alive.
The actor who plays the gill man was apparently an olympic champion swimmer, and one scene in particular shows how great a swimmer he truly was. It has that 50's feel to it, so the drama is melodramatic at times, but that's part of the appeal of these old films.
When I bought this movie, it was part of a limited run to determine the films popularity. Because it wasn't advertised well, it didn't sell well, and I ended up getting it from a collector. Now that it's available mainstream, anyone who loves classic science fiction should get a copy of it. It's a classic alright. Get a copy today, before it's gone.
