The Patriot is one of the best films I saw during the summer of 2000. It is a step above most brainless action movies.
The plot, while based on  actual events and people, has been greatly twisted and warped for a  Hollywood story. I personally think the true stories of the Revolutionary  war are much more interesting. There was a big media frenzy in England over  the character of Mel Gibson's main adversary. Saying the cruel behaviour  did not take place. Towards the end some of the plot twists seem more than  a bit hokey. Example, the love interest between Mel and the character of  his departed wife's sister.
The movie presents first-rate production  values. The action is easy to follow even during the confusing and muddles  battles of the Revolutionary War.
The acting is what you would expect in  a big budget movie. The supporting cast provided the best in terms of  it.
Weighing in at close to 3 hours, the movie does not slow down at all.  There are almost no pauses to give you time to think how long this movie  really is. This is a recomendation to see from me.
