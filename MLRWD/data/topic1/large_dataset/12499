I like the 10 minute segment formats of this DVD series. Most of the segments worked me out pretty well, although the buns and thights section was pretty disappointing. The moves don't flow very well together during each segment. It seems like there is a lot of readjusting positions. The instructor was pretty good, although I didn't like her inconsistency giving breathing cues. For example, during one exercise, which only has 4 reps, she carefully explains the exercise as you do the first rep, then reiterates the verbal directions throughout the next 3 reps. She never tells you when to inhale and exhale (breathing is really important in Pilates), and does this for several of the exercises throughout the DVD. Sometimes she does make a point to loudly exhale into the mic so you can hear it. To get a good workout with this DVD, I would recommend these few things: 1. Watch the DVD once or twice to familiarize yourself with the correct form for all the moves.  2. Use a yoga/pilates mat. It will really help your knees from getting bruised.  3. Don't use hand weights over 3 lbs. for the arms section.  4. Stretch a bit before doing the workouts (some of the exercises are designed for the very flexible).  5. Make sure you have plenty of room to move around for the exercises.
