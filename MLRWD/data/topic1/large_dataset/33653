The Wachowski Brothers (writers of the Stallone/Banderas flick "Assassins") make their directorial debut with this film-noir thriller.  Bound is the classic tale of a gangster's moll named Violet  (Jennifer Tilly) wanting to escape the business and her mob boyfriend  Ceasar (Joe Pantoliano) and enlists the help of her new love interest (Gina  Gershon) to do it.
Except this movie has a twist.  The  "handyman" next door, Corky, is a butch dyke who's just got out  of prison for the "redistribution of wealth" and redecorating the  apartment next to Violet and Ceasar's.  Violet, pouty-lipped and  husky-voiced, seduces Corky and the two come up with a plan to steal 2  million dollars that Ceasar is holding for his mob boss, and escape from  mob life.
The plotline, seemingly formulaic, has many twists and  surprises for the viewer.  Not to mention a steamy love scene between Corky  and Violet, surpervised by real-life sexpert Susie Bright (who also had a  cameo in the film) to make sure the lesbian scene was accurate.
One of  the real standouts, besidse the great acting between Tilly and Gershon, is  Joe Pantoliano as the gangster Ceasar.  His portrayal of the small-time  hood is dead-on, and we find that even Ceasar, who is supposedly being  screwed over by his mistress and her lover, is also very clever.
Over  all, I found this movie very exciting and was spellbound when I saw it.  However, it is not for the squeamish.  There are a few violent scenes, and  some persons might find the lesbian sex scene offensive (what I don't get  is why?).
However, I'd suggest this movie to any fan of 40s-50s gangster  movies, and even Tarantino and Coen Brothers fans.  Another movie you might  want to check out is "The Matrix," which was also done by the  Wachowskis.
