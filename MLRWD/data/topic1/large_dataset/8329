This is one of the funniest movies ever. I'm actually not joking on this review, I mean its not a straight up, gag, pun, every second kind of movie but it tries to get these kids into these accidents and the kids are so dumb its so funny. Like the first killing when that guys house is on fire, he shimmies down that ladder and somehow he's stuck under it, ladder 2 inches in front of his face, he breathes a sigh of relief and then the pole goes through his skull at the speed of a car. Then theres this kid at the dentist and he gets a fish stuck in his mouth and he walks out of the building and a very tough piece of glass falls on his and he explodes!!! ITS SO F#$%*#& FUNNY!!! I could go on and on. Like the airbag stick part, it'll git CHA!!!  WAIT then comes the FUNNIEST PART OF THE WHOLE MOVIE!! Theres this one part where this ladies head gets ripped up by an elevator and this black guy is mad and is half wookie half fat albert and makes the funniest noise i have ever heard in my whole life. "URRRRRRRRAGHGGHG!!!" I HAVE'T LAUGHED THAT HARD IN MY LIFE, SINCE SHINDLER"S LIST!!! AHHH YHES!!!! They should have sold this movie as a straight comedy it would have done better. Ahhh if you want to have a good time rent this and KAZAAM and let the physical pleasure begin.

The ending is funny too
