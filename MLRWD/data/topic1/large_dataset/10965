Of course, a primer on deconstruction in the form of a movie for the consumption of the general public, or even an educated subset of that public would be a hopeless task.  So what can we hope for?  We get a taste of Derrida's quickness and playfulness and the everyday sequences may go a long way to dispelling the foreboding nihilistic spectre that those who wilfully wish to be blind to any understanding of Deconstruction have sometime constructed of him.  For those with some understanding, hearing Derrida speak, and work on ideas on the fly is a wonderful experience.  The interviewers focus may not have been on issues that seem to me more central -- there are quotes, perhaps such as from Margins on metaphor that might perhaps have been more interesting a focus -- but they are interesting nonetheless.  I do wish they had more footage with interview of others on Derrida.  The filmakers apparently claimed to want to avoid glosses on Derrida, but the selection of scenes, questions, times and editing of the filmakers are a gloss of the most obvious and intrusive form.  Apparently they interviewed Spivak -- I can't help believe that this would have been wonderful material even if put into the special feature component of the DVD.  Her take, focussed by her obvious deep understanding might have done much to allay the qualms of those voicing complaints about a lightness on the philosophy.

But all in all something that I was very happy to have bought and I'm very thankful the filmakers pressed on with this task.
