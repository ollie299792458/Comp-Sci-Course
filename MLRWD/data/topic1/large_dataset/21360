This review is for the "Collector's Edition" of "To Kill a Mockingbird". The movie easily gets five stars, and the transfer on this disc is well done, but nowhere in the product description does it say "letterboxed" as it should. If you have an older 4x3 TV this edition is OK. If you have a newer widescreen 16x9 TV then you need <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X7664">To Kill a Mockingbird (Universal Legacy Series)</a>, called "Special Edition" on the Universal website, for an anamorphic widescreen version. Amazon lists both as merely "Widescreen". Universal lists this collectors edition as widescreen, but does specify Anamorphic for the Special Edition. I usually do a bit of research before purchasing DVDs, but in this case I jumped the gun, and now I will have to pay another $20 to get the correct release for my needs. Usually these discrepancies are addressed in product reviews, but I didn't see any addressing this particular issue. IMDB.com does however correctly list this edition as letterboxed.
