Season 6 of Seinfeld continues the wonderfully thought up story's which sometimes are based on actually people! The laughs, character problems, plot combination's & overall entertaining show hasn't lost anything and gained plenty!
This season includes all hilarious episodes and to name just a few; "The Scofflaw", "The Chinese Women", "The Face Painter", "The Understudy", "The Label Maker"
I have watched every single episode, still laughing and enjoying the unique predicaments the characters get in and how things play out at the end!
If you're a Seinfeld fan like me and have all of the previous seasons on DVD, you have to get this one too!!!
