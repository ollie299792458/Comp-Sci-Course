High adventure, interesting if not maybe somewhat predictable plot, and Mel's great and humourus acting style made this the best of the post nuclear war motion pictures which was the trend in the '80's. These movies were very relevent at the time because as a recent high school graduate, nuclear war was something we all felt could be our future to face. This story picks up after the "almost tomorrow" storyline of Mad Max. It is not essential to view Mad Max before seeing this feature as I didn't even know of it's exsistence at the time of my first viewing. But you shouldn't cheat yourself because the three mad max films make for a great escapist trilogy. Other than a few outdated 80's hairstyles, this film holds up extremely well. I would prefer they reissue this dvd with a remastered deluxe version as they did with the first film, but from my understanding the American version is owned by a different studio which which makes it a property rights issue. Although this is my favorite of the max movies, I would have to rank them from the first film being the best cinemaphotographly to the last film Beyond Thunderdome as the weakest of the lot. But you should see them all.
