in maya tourovskaya's book on tarkovsky, the animal cruelty issue was raised in an interview with tamara ogorodnikova, who produced 'andrei rublev': 
"my god, mayechka, it is only a movie!" 
she  explicitly stated that no animals were harmed in the filming process, and  that the burning cow sequence was achieved through special effects and  asbestos. the cow scene never made the 183-minute cut because tarkovsky  felt it looked unrealistic. 
acceptance of  this disclaimer is your  prerogative, but disclaimers are all most of us ever really have.  o, and  the film? 
it doesn't sound great and the stock doesn't seem to have aged  well, but tarkovsky's intensely poetic vision and vyacheslav ovchinnikov's  unforgettable score cannot be denied. like literary counterparts dostoevsky  and tolstoy, tarkovsky has a sweeping, epic vision that can seem daunting  at times (203 minutes is pretty long). while some may find it interminably  and excruciatingly slow, i like to think that tarkovsky has enough respect  for the audience to take his time and allow the viewer to settle into the  experience. it's not just a great visual and audio document or merely a  powerful story - 'andrei rublev' is a gestalt experience, requiring and  rewarding total immersion on your part. watch it alone or with someone  who's comfortable enough with you to shut up for a few hours. you'll be  glad you did.
