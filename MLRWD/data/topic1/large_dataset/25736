Have you ever had the feeling, while watching a horror/suspense movie, that all of the violence and gore is just a cover up? That maybe it's used to shock you because the story is weak? Well, your suspicions are about to be confirmed. This film is the anti-horror movie, the one and only masterpiece that proves one thing: real life is far more terrorizing than anything typically played out in a movie. Rather than showing you the run up to a horrible event, as every other movie I've seen does, Funny Games is just as much a tale about the aftermath, and portrays the visceral human emotion in a way other filmmakers are probably afraid to do. We see the ordinary scenes that surround any horrible event, the things that make it so very real - and it's all under the shadow of the sadistic, creepy killers who show up any character that has come before them. This film drills you down and never lets up.

I'm not usually one to warn anyone against seeing a film, but this really isn't for the weak - In fact, I'd say it takes a special breed to come out of watching this film without being forever affected by it; I know I have been. It's powerful and dangerous stuff.
