I didn't read all the customer reviews, but I scanned about 50 of them and the featured review, and did not see one mention of the fact that Frank Booth is a very very funny character. Even Kyle MacLachlan, in an interview on the DVD version, said that he was supposed to be scared but found Dennis Hopper too funny to be afraid.

I sample:

Ben: 'Here's to your health.'

Frank: 'No. Let's toast to something else. Let's toast to f***ing...Say: here's to your f**k, Frank;'

Ben: 'Very well, then. Here's to your f**k, Frank...Cheers!'

Frank: 'God damn, you're one suave f**k.'

terrifying? oedipal? haunting? NO!!...Funny!!!

This movie would be terrible without Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth. Jeffrey is pretty cool, and Ben is awesome for a few moments, but, that's it. There's nothing else.

Best of all, Dennis Hopper spent years trying to distance himself from this role, giving all the credit to David Lynch, not wanting to be seen as such a depraved maniac by all the frat houses and elsewhere that love Frank Booth so much.

See this movie to see Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth. Skip the rest.
