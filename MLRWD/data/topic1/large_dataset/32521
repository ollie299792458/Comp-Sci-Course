This movie is outstanding as many others have mentioned. I remember seeing an interview where Richard Jenkins said that one of his favorite movies of all time is "On the Waterfront." I decided to see it, so I could get an idea of what he was talking about.

This movie is truly one of the great iconic films of American cinema.  The performances from Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger, Eva Marie Saint, and Karl Malden are all excellent.  Marlon Brando is hypnotic.  He knows his character intimately and disappears within his character.  He makes the viewer feel and believe that underneath his tough exterior is a tender soul that yearns for love and acceptance.  Brando is able to convey feelings,  thoughts and emotions in body language and facial expressions without even saying a word.  Among the many wonderful scenes, the scene in the car with Steiger and Brando  and the one in the bar with Brando and Eva Marie Saint are my favorites.

Each character is perfectly pitched and the story moves along at a good pace.  Elia Kazan said that Sam Speigel basically compelled Budd Schulberg to keep editing the script and the story, to wittle it down to what we have in the movie.  Kazan felt that the story was edited down to perfection due to the fact that Budd worked so long and so diligently under Speigel's insistence.  Of course, the finished product is a masterpiece, and a masterclass in the art of cinema.
