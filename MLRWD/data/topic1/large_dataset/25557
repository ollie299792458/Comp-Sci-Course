Bumps in the night and scary things return in "Paranormal Activity 2". This time the haunting isn't happening to Micah and Katie, but are now happening to Katie's sister and her family. Kristi and Daniel Rey begin to experience some odd things in their house after their son is born. These start with small things such as the pool cleaner climbing out of the pool at night and eventually grow out of control where people in the house are dragged down stairs.

  "Paranormal Activity 2" is not the sequel to "Paranormal Activity" but actually the prequel. This gives some nice backstory to the first one and overall turned out to be pretty decent. The effects were nice much like the first one. The feel of a handheld camera and the look through the security cameras really make this movie, much like the first one, feel real. That is what I believe makes audiences freak out, the fact that they aren't seeing it through an expensive hollywood camera but through the eyes of something that is physically present in the house. Some of the moments in "Paranormal Activity 2" don't really fulfill their purpose though. Some of the things that are meant to scare you actually turn out quite comical I will not mention these to avoid spoiling anyone's experience.
  While "Paranormal Activity 2" is more of the same it still makes a nice chill run down your spine and really works well with the first one. I was quite happy that the two stories were tied together. Let's just prey that they don't try to milk this for all it's worth and make a third one. Can we please let this end on a good note and not turn out like the god awful "Saw" franchise which died after the second one?
I give it a 6.5 out of 10
