I saw this show on Broadway about a year ago.  The premise was funny, the performances were good, the songs were great, but the ending was too forced.  I like happy endings, except when they seem contrived, which was the case with this show.  Interestingly and somewhat disappointingly, the movie strives to be no more than a copy of the Broadway show.  This creates a series of problems, especially with the dialogue.  Some of it does not work in a movie setting.  Recently, Chicago triumphed as a movie thanks to it very clever adaptation.  The Director of Producers considers filming a few outdoor scenes to be sufficient to adapt this show and that is not the case.  There are several other adaptation issues:  (1) Uma is beautiful but cannot sing--they really should have dubbed her singing voice; (2) Nathan and Matthew are too theatrical in their performances; and (3) Matthew is too old for this part and it shows on the screen.  That aside, I loved the supporting cast.  Gary Beach, Roger Bart and Will Ferrell are simply BRILLIANT.  The sequence of Sprintime for Hitler is BREATHTAKING.  Talk about showstopper!  This alone is worth the price of the DVD.  BTW, I also loved John Barrowman as the Lead Tenor of this sequence.  Sadly, the movie starts going downhill after this highpoint.  Still, I think it's worth the four stars.
