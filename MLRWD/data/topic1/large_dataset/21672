What would you do if you lived in the late 70s/early 80s and harbored a deep desire to watch a show that featured transdimensional time traveling agents, cryptic story lines, and obscure plot twists galore? You could wait for the X-Files to air, but since Agents Mulder and Scully wouldn't be along for a couple of decades, why you watched Sapphire and Steel, of course.

This was a series that way way ahead of its time, starring Joanna Lumley and David McCallum as the lead operatives Sapphire and Steel, with a penchant to deliver their dialog with minimal changes in facial expression (thus predicting the widespread use of botox in the not-too-distant future) and to frequently gaze into the middle distance as they...well, operated.

Bizarre but brilliant. There was one particularly  creepy arc of episodes of folks from the future who lived in an apartment that turned out to be alive....

And the title sequence was an all-time classic that began:

"All irregularities will be handled by the forces controlling each dimension. Transuranic, heavy elements may not be used where there is life. Medium atomic weights are available....."

They don't make shows like they used to.
