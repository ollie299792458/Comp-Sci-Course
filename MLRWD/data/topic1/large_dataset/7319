"Lawrence of Arabia" is, of course, one of the finest motion pictures ever made -- no secret there!! The current DVD release offers the highest quality picture on home video to date. Nevertheless, it still doesn't come within a mile of revealing the glorious clarity of this film when it's projected in 70-millimeter onto a huge screen. The audio on this disc -- notably the music -- sounds extremely compressed and nasal to my poor ears. Just as a comparison, check out the music on the Director's Restoration laserdisc. There's a big, BIG difference !! Which leads me to the following:
I would gladly support Columbia/TriStar bringing out a Superbit edition of "Lawrence", if only to have Superbit's added visual crispness and its uncompressed audio. And I wouldn't care one bit if Act One had to be split over two disc sides -- its running time alone is longer than most ordinary films anyway. "Lawrence" deserves the best possible treatment no matter what the format. The price of Superbit DVDs isn't significantly higher. Is there anyone at Columbia/TriStar who's listening?
