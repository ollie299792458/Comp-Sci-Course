i loved the movie. gosh, it was made in 1989 and it's 2005 and i remember it well. an unplanned pregnancy, they talked about the roller coaster of life and to just go with the flow. take whatever life brings your way and instead of whining about not being in control, learn to look on the positive side of it. as with tom hulce, it just shows us that some things can't or won't ever get better. love doesn't conquer all. we have to accept that too. he had to let go. i saw unconditional love from that parent. a part of him died when tom walked out of his life. when one door shut, another door opened when tom left his son with him. diane weist had to let go. her youngest son was growing up and he was going through changes that she couldn't help him with. her older son got a girl pregnant. she decided to accept it and be a part of it. she didn't have anyone in her life. that left her alone. gosh, there was SO much in this story. i wouldn't say the families were dysfunctional. there were just issues and everybody worked their way through them. dysfunctional is beating on your kids, being drunk, kids being disrespectful and out of control, etc. these were very loving families. in one way or another, the parents all had to let go of something, but they got something else out of doing that. being a parent can be painful, but it's also the best thing that ever can happen to a person. i loved the movie. i think it was before its time.
