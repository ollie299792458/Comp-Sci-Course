I enjoyed this movie as far as entertainment. I do realize that it is based on a book. My husband who was born in Ireland left this area of Boston because he wanted to get away from the Irish American element of the area. the Irish American attitude is to drink round the clock, eat corned beef and cabbage on St Patrick's Day and dye their hair green. This makes him ashamed and he wanted to separate himself of this stereotype. Irish American s have no idea of what being Irish is all about and most have never seen the sky over Ireland and never will. The Irish American women he met before he married me (A New York Italian American)would drink him under the table and used language as foul as it gets.
Our feeling about Casy Affleck playing the role that he did is that it was the wrong role for him. Who knows? Maybe Ben said "I can't pay you but, this hopefully will add to your Resume". We had a hard time taking Casey seriously. He is a stickman at probably 5'10" and weighing in at about 148 lbs. Thank God he had a gun permit and was carrying in the bar scene or he would have been crushed- snapped in two pieces like a twig.
