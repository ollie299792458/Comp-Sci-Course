I was waiting for these two movies to be available on DVD, and while the packaging leaves much to be desired (more in a moment), I'm glad that they're finally available on DVD, and having them both available on one disc at a very reasonable price--a bargain, in fact--is a good idea.

Those who saw these movies previously *want* them for their collections for a reason; the acting is top-rate, the story is a classic, and the presentation (i.e. cinematography) is skilled and artistic (which is a rare combination). I suppose that the lack of "remastering" of the actual picture is due to the "bargain" nature of the release. Still, it's a small flaw in an otherwise excellent pair of films... and I didn't have *either* of them in *any* quality, VHS or otherwise, before this release.

The major drawback, as others have said, is the packaging--specifically the lack of any accompanying material, even a simple two-page (i.e. one fold) insert with a scene selection listing and brief discussion of the importance of the films for French (and world) cinema would have been appreciated. I don't know what the obstacles to a Criterion Collection release would be, but that would be what I would demand if I were going to purchase these movies on DVD again. Perhaps that will be done in the next format (Blue-ray or HD-DVD), though if it were to come out on current DVD in such an edition I'd be likely to get it.

Nevertheless, until there is a "collector's edition" (hopefully by Criterion) pairing these films, I'm more than happy with this!
