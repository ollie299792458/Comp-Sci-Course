What is there to say? This is arguably the best of the rocky series.  Rocky vs Drago.  USA vs USSR.  Good vs Evil.  Call it whatever you want.  If you need a movie to pump you up there is nothing better than this.

Soundtrack still holds up to today's standards and when he's training in the barn in no man's land Russia, it's hard not to want to bust out some crunches and do it right alongside with the great one.  I find it hard to contain myself watching this movie without wanting to sign up for the boxing gym down the street so I can get in on the action for myself.  Sometimes I often find myself speaking in Rocky lingo, yelling out "Yo ADRIAN" to any random lucky lady who gets the honor of hearing my man call.  As long as you can do it correctly it has been proven to work 80% of the time.  The other 20% of the time, the women are able to resist, but just barely... I can see they are conflicted but then yell back at me "You CAN'T WIN"... which makes me just train that much harder for the next round.  This movie is great, I would say it's at least 110% more efficient than Insanity.  If you train like Rocky then you can knock out the next annoying person asking you to try Insanity.  It's a great feeling!
