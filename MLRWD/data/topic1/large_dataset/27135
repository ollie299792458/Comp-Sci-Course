This is the best Star Trek Movie hands down, you don't even have to be a trekker or trekkie to enjoy it.
It does help if you know where the hate began between Kirk and Khan, but it isn't really necessary, all you need to know is that there is some serious bad blood between these two, plus Khan explains it all in a perfectly done scene where he finds Chekov on his ship (or whats left of it) FYI, Chekov wasn't on the Enterprise when Khan made his original appearance on Star Trek way back when, but let's not get into that.
To see the Enterprise finally take a beating was spectacular, so far this ship had taken many lickings but never looked any worse, this time it gets it's butt whooped. The conflict between Khan's intelligence and Kirk's instincts and experience as a starship captain is what makes this movie so interesting. Just see it, remeber it was made almost 20 years ago, so the effects will not be up to todays digital standards of course, but they still are pretty good.
If that scene with Kirk screaming KHAN!!!! doesn't stick in your head , then maybe you're not a sci fi fan.
