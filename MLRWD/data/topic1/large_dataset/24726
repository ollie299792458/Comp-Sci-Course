This movie is definitely not your traditional hollywood movie. Its not about special effects, or big drama or even overwrought emotionality. Rather, this is about real people, struggling to find a path in life. Its a tale of humanity.
Laura Linney turns in a performance that deserved an Oscar nomination as Sammy, sister to Mark Ruffalo's character Terry. At a young age, Sammy and Terry were emotionally scarred by their parents sudden death. As they grew up, rootless Terry took off to explore life outside of their small town, and Sammy settled down - she got married and divorced, had a child, and began working at the local bank.
After one long extended disappearance, Terry shows up again at the home that they both own, asking Sammy for money. But then things begin to change as Terry winds up staying with Sammy and her son Rudy for a visit. Slowly Terry begins to act as a male father-like influence on Rudy, spending time with the sheltered young boy, trying to teach him "that life sucks". Meanwhile, Sammy begins to let her hair down again by impulsively starts an affair with her detestable boss, and her steady boyfriend proposes. 
A study in human contrasts, You Can Count on Me wound up touching me in both predictable and odd moments. Such as when Sammy cries out, during one confrontation, "I wish Mom was here." Or when she kicks him out for what he does to them. Even as he lashes out wrongly at Rudy, Terry's immaturity kicks you in the solar plexus. What really got to me was the fact that even as Sammy was Terrys anchor to stability, Terry is Sammy's anchor to a constant enduring bond.
This movie doesn't have a happy ending- or an unhappy ending. Rather, it has what I call a life ending. That is, it ends in such a way that you have to remember that life does keep going, and you have to life life on your own terms. 
This movie is definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year. I'd recommend it for people who want real characters and excellent acting.
