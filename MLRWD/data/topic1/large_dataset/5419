As an Amanda Tapping fan I was excited about the series when it first started out as a Web only production.  I was very pleased that the support of a network allowed the show to continue to blossom.

The first few episodes have elements that are the same as the web based episodes, but there are some differences as well including cameos by Paul McGillion and David Hewlitt (Stargate Atlantis).  The show does continue to have cameos from other Stargate Alumni such as Kavan Smith.

The production on the web series was revolutionary having been shot almost entirely Green Screen with digital effects providing the backgrounds.  This allowed the creators much greater flexibility when writing the environments (and some of the residents) of the Sanctuary.  The tv based show continues this production method and with the additional resources provided by the network, the results are generally excellent.  The characters are unusual and well portrayed by an excellent group of actors.  The requisit suspension of disbelief is made possible by the combination of setting and character.

The story revolves around Dr. Helen Magnus (Amanda Tapping) and the Sanctuary she has created for "Abnormals".  Robin Dunne plays Dr. Will Zimmerman - a doctor with an usual talent for noticing things overlooked by others.  He is recruited by Dr. Magnus to provide psychological counseling to the residents of the Sanctuary and to assist with "missions".  Emilie Ullerup plays Helen's daughter, and Christopher Heyerdahl plays several characters, all with unique twists.
