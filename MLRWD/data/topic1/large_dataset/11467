I enjoy this ballet, it's ever-so-English, very much in the style of a Covent Garden production.  I won't repeat what good comments others have posted here, but did want to suggest adding one or two later versions to your shelf.  Rudolf thought about R&J for a lot of years after this first one was filmed, and eventually he created a darker, more adult, and supremely gorgeous version in the early 1980's.

There are two films of the Nureyev choreography that I know of:  one is the Paris Opera Ballet DVD, mid-1990's, I believe, choreographed by Nureyev (but not with him in it).  It is visually dramatic from the beginning, and puts you on notice that something heavy will happen.  Also available, but harder to find, is the VHS from about 1982 starring him and Carla Fracci, a La Scala production, all Italian dancers except Rudolf. It's the same staging as POB, and gives you the opportunity to see Rudolf in action.  He's 44, and no longer boyish, but he pairs up well with Carla Fracci.  That woman has no trouble keeping up with him.

Owning both the earlier Fonteyn/Nureyev vehicle and one or both of the others makes for a nice R&J collection.  Fonteyn is girlish and dies a fairly ladylike death, no gut-wrenching silent howls.  Twenty years later, the other two ballerinas allow themselves to be not-so-pretty when they discover Romeo is lost to them forever.  In particular the portrayal of Juliet by Monique Loudieres (POB) is spot-on, her finale really gets to you.

I like the La Scala production, Carla Fracci and Nureyev together move fast, a lot of great lifts.  They dance with great physicality, and a few of Rudolf's solos let you see what made him so hot in the first place.
