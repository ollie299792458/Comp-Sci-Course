How this splendid documentary fascinates! I think of the "No Fear" slogans plastered here and there, and how this film tells us that, even among the best of us, fear is the TRUTH. Ali had good reason to  fear Foreman, a big and strong fighter who hit harder than anyone known.  Despite his antics and his loud assertions that there is "Nothing to  be scared of," the movie gives us priceless zoom-ins to Ali's face...  his eyes... and the essence of his fears. But "When We Were  Kings" goes on to explore how Ali kept himself focused on the  challenge, acting bravely in spite of it all. We can see the brilliant  "psychological warfare" that Ali waged, and how he used ingenious  ploys to rise above fears that would unravel ordinary mortals. 
 Beyond  depicting a splendid account of how one man faced his fears, and triumphed  in the end, this film also captures the "feel" of emerging  African pride in the 1970s. (A scene where Ali describes differences  between African American blues music and music typical of white tastes is  just hilarious). Also, it does give Foreman his due -- he went into a deep  depression after the fight but worked himself out of it, reinvented  himself, and emerged later as a different kind of champion.  Yes, it is not  surprising that a film like this would be popular with the  "motivational" circuit. Watch it when you feel the need to give  yourself a good jolt out of your own fearful inaction in confronting what  you need to do.
