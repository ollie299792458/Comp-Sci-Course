This review applies to the CineVu version of Thunderbolt. This is an illegal version of this movie. The DVD is actually a DVD-R. I could tell because of the purple color of the data side of the DVD. Also, the label on the DVD looks like is was created with a home DVD label maker. The images used for the DVD insert are blurry. The insert looks like it was printed using a home printer. The description of the movie isn't accurate either! Jackie is described as, "a top race car driver in Hong Kong," when he's actually a mechanic who attended a Mitsubishi driving school in Japan. There is no "Triad boss from Macao" in this movie and Jackie doesn't have a girlfriend either! I don't know where the description for this movie came from, but the creators of this bootleg version weren't even trying!

The picture and sound quality are terrible as well. This transfer looks like it came from an old VHS copy that was purchased at a Chinatown flea market. Stay away from this version of Thunderbolt! I wonder if Amazon even screens the DVDs they sell to ensure they aren't selling black market versions.
