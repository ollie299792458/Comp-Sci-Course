This is an endearing movie and a wonderful love story. Noah and Allie are two lovers torn apart by World War II and financial differences. At first things don't click but Noah keeps pushing. One look at Allie and he knows she's the one he wants for the rest of his life. He shows her things she couldn't imagine or appreciate until he stepped into her life.

Soon enough they are crazy for each other and are practically inseparable. But throughout the movie, you follow their doomed love story. Allie's leaving tears Noah apart. He writes to her everyday for a year, however, her mother who doesn't approve of Noah, hides the letters from her, thinking she is protecting her. Allie, hurt from the absence of letters, assumes Noah doesn't love her anymore. She goes off and finds someone else to love. Coincidentally Noah sees them together after all his hard work on the house she said they could live in. He built it to every word she said.

Then, as Allie is finding a wedding dress, she sees the house, so perfect, in the newspaper and faints. She visits Noah and you can probably guess what happens next in this love story that will touch your heart. This is a movie for the ages, destined to be remembered as fondly as Casablanca is today. I just loved it.
