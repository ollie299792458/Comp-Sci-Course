The "Urban Legend" franchise has been pretty steady for the past couple of years. I just don't understand why this movie was made. It shifts from the slasher feel of the previous two movies and delves into a more supernatural focus. The film is pretty bad. I'm definitely a huge fan of horror movies and it doesn't take a lot to impress me but this was just mediocre.

The acting is extremely sub-par and this is especially disappointing because Kate Mara is in the cast. She delivered some pretty good roles in "Nip/Tuck" and "Jack & Bobby" but she goes through this movie, along with the rest of the actors in an incoherent storyline that shifts from scene to scene with no depth. It's hard to care about the characters at all. They just float around with seemingly no purpose. I even almost quit watching the movie halfway but being the avid horror fan I am, I had to continue.

There is only one really cool death scene that gave this movie 1 star. It involves a pretty girl and a spider. Most of the rest of the death scenes are just retreads of urban legends the characters talked about in the past two movies. The film even has a cameo scene from "Final Cut" in which a character is watching a porn on the TV.

Overall, not even worth a rental. Luckily for me, I didn't have to waste 3 bucks because it was available for free on my Comcast ON Demand.
