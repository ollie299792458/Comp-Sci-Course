i'm trying not to spoil anything ... but read at your own risk anyways. Ok now, first off I want to say that i'm a 26 year old and a bit of a movie freak, and i love disney movies in particular. I watched The princess and the frong when it came out and was so let down it was half hearted attempt from disney and it had a couple of cute momments but overall a huge disapointment. Having said that i can now say this, i was really doubtful when they released tangled, i mean after all i grew up in the second golden age of disney amimation, little mermaid, beauty and the beast, ect ect..  nothing could compare, until now.. i was shocked at how great this movie truely is, the animation is stellar, i mean the lantern secne  was so moving and beautiful,  it even topped the ball room secne from beauty and the beast, the voice acting was amazing i was kinda worried when i heard Mandy Moore was playing rapunzel, but happy to be proven wrong. the characters were well rounded, and the sidekicks are great. The music is catchy * even if it takes a couple of viewings* and brought to you by the always great Allen Menken. the last few secnes had me to tears. I was more then happy to find myself back in a real fairy tale story,where you can once again believe in a happily ever after, and if you read the story of Rapunel there are little things from the original fairy tale that are present in the re-telling if you look for them. So after a long long long absence, welcome back Disney, to what made you great.
