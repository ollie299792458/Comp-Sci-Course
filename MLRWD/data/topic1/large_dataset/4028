I maintain that The Beatles are the greatest musical influence since Bach.  You thought I was gonna say Mozart didn't ya?  I am a bass player, so Bach is more to my liking.  The reason I am a bass player is because of Paul McCartney.  I grew up in West Texas and before the Beatles, I was all Merle Haggard, the Everleys, and a little Miles Davis.  Hearing "Love Me Do" when I was 13 years-old changed my life.  I ended up playing bass guitar for a living, for not much money, for 12 years.  But, I digress.  For me, what makes this Anthology wonderful is watching The Beatles go through the changes they experienced.  It is so cool to see them progress as musicians.  One of the things that stood out for me was that through all of the changes they underwent personally, their music was their lives.  I think this documentary of the phenomenon is a must have for all Beatles fans.  These guys were the soundtrack of my life.  I still hurt when I remember watching Monday Night Football  on December 8, 1980 and hearing Howard Cosell announce that John Lennon had been murdered.  When I was married, my wife and I danced to McCartney's "My Love."  I can't hear a Beatles song without it taking me back to some point in my life; some good, some bad, but all still alive in my heart and memory.  I know it sounds sappy, but it's like the feeling you get watching home movies.  It's a sublime pain that I enjoy inflicting on myself.  Buy this and watch it after smoking a big joint.
