I only had this one on VHS as I'd somehow missed the original DVD releases of the first two Toy Story films. I'm glad I had to wait for this version. The video has been cleaned up with a higher bit rate (the original looked super to begin with!) and the sound is much improved with new options that weren't available before now.

The only negative I can see is the failure to include a short and I'm not even sure it's worth mentioning. I remember all of the Pixar films having a short except for maybe this one. The VHS release didn't have one but the original DVD release had one called "Tin Toy". Was this one even released with the movie or just on the original DVD? Try for the life of me, I just can't recall. I checked it out on the Pixar site and it sure didn't look familiar and we sure aren't missing much but it sure seems weird to have included this in an earlier DVD release but to leave it out from the 10th Anniversary, 2-disc version. It just makes the package seem a little incomplete somehow.

Other than the minor omission of a short, this excellent package should be in everyone's collection, even if you don't have kids or grandkids! If you have an original DVD release, pick this one up too. There are enough improvements and new features to make the extra $16 worthwhile.
