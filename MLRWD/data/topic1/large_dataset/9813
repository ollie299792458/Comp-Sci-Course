The technical advisors for this movie had to be retired Transit cops, Transit workers, and NYC Cops. Every detail, Every slang term, police and transit jargon, on location set was 100% accurate. I myself worked for the NYC Transit Authority as a cop and later switched to the NYPD as a cop. When I first saw this movie I woke up the next day and for a brief moment thought the hijacking actually occured.

Back in the 70's the Transit PD was second fiddle to the NYPD. The NYPD had all the big action and Transit PD was just a boring job. Transit cops basically stood around waiting and hoping for some action in the subway. The director illustrates this so accurately in the movie, I felt like I was there. The set of the Transit Authority's command center and the Transit Police control center were an exact replica's. Walter Mattau subtle humor is so typical of many veteran cops. The action was all on location, the streets of NYC, the tunnels of the NYC  subway and the actual train it self. It's so realistic your eye's will be glued to the screen. MY FAVORITE.
