Natural Born Killers is easily the best movie to come out of this decade. It is surreal, highly intelligent, sarcastic, and like the Exorcist, seems to have some kind of power beneath the simple plot. The actors and  actresses all perform perfectly as their characters, Tommy Lee Jones  rightly over-the-top, and Woody Harrelson a subtle, evil Mickey Knox. The  cinematography is simply amazing, pure amped beauty, the psychological  screens behind the action, the desert, and my god, the violence of the  riot... perfect.
There's something going on in every sceen of the movie,  like Owen at the beginning in the diner, or pictures of Mallory's father  when she's with the gas station attendant. The movie was deep (sorry about  the cliche) like in the whole Native American sceen where the word  "demon" and "too much t.v." flash on the muderers  chests. Later in the movie we hear more explictily about the demon in  Mickey's amazing television interview with Wayne Gayle.
But the main  reason about why is movie is what it is and somehow more, is its message.  It isn't subtle about it either. The media has gotten way too important,  fed itself fat on society's rich blood, and yet we scream for more, we want  our blood sucked. Every day our lives are permeated with violence, violence  in movies, television, the news, and we crave it. Natural Born Killers was  a wake up call, and a choatic brilliant one at that, turning a warped  mirror around and pointing it at the audience. You see those people  worshipping Mickey and Mallory at the outside the court sceen, that is us,  that is who we are, and this movie tries to get us to wake up and see that.
