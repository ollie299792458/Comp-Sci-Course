Just what my title says. Immagine the doomsday, totalitarian government and gritty realism of 1984 mixed with the power and derring-do of The Scarlet Pimpernel, with  a(n) (anti-)hero definetly reminescent of that deranged genuis, the Phantom of the Opera, all in the best way possible.

A bit more on the hero: the ordinary-guy past of the protagonist of 1984, whose name escapes me at the moment, the way he turned himself into a minor superhero through intense physical and mental training like Sir Percy (of Scarlet), and his obviously tormented mind, like Erik (of Phantom).

I truly loved the message. It could've so easily turned into "Life's a bitch, then you die. Whatcha gonna do about it?", but it turned into more of a "I help those who help themselves" sorta thing.

The world in which V and Evie and the others live is scarily accurate. In one of my favorite scenes, a purple-faced, bellowing dictator shakes his fist in the air as he stands at a podium emblazoned with his ominous red-and-black emblem, as rows of gray-uniformed, blank-faced soldiers march past in a neverending wave of death. Think Hitler's Nazis mixed with Stalin's Soviets.

Enough rambling and ranting, now. Go see it, and if you have, rock on. Vive la Revolution!
