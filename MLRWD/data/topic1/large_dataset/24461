**No Spoilers** The Craft is one of those movies that will ultimately become Timeless. It will appeal to young audiences, and will most likely carry on through to adulthood as a "favorite movie worth seeing again and again." (think in terms of the "cult favorites" Carrie, The Breakfast Club, Grease) I am not well versed in Wiccan and/or witchcraft practices, so for me this film satisfied an element of curiosity. The entire cast gives impeccable performances in their respective roles.  Fairuza Balk has one of the most commanding screen presence I have ever seen, and manages to further convey her characters feelings and attitude with simple facial expressions, furthering her character's "edge" - even when spoken dialogue isn't offered. She is a brilliant performer, and is a real gem on screen. Robin Tunney, Neve Campbell, and Rachel True also provide equally impressive performances. In supporting roles, Skeet Ulrich and Christine Taylor are amazing. Skeet Ulrich's skill as an actor is apparent as he very delicately and convincingly morphs his character as deemed necessary for the story, and though her character sort of breezes in and out of scenes, Christine Taylor also shines in her role as the "class bitch." As the audience we know we are suppose to dislike her character - and we do - but she has this way of playing villainy with a sort of comedic approach which makes her a stand out performer. She is a young Bette Davis, if you will. Since the release of this film, all of the cast have found success in their careers, but it's fun to revisit a film like this that showcases new or under-rated talent before they go on to become household names.
