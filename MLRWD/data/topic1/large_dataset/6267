The beginning of the movie was excellent.  Somewhere along the way, it turned into a unbelievable comic book adventure with Dennis Quaid as a near indestructible secret service agent.  Suffice it to say that the entire ending/climax rested on the most oblivious pedestrian in the history of the world.  Not only will this 10 year old year girl blindly bump into Forest Whittaker with her ice cream cone, she'll walk through four lanes of speeding traffic with a care.  Cars will speed past her and barely miss forcing her off the freeway, then incredibly she'll keep walking back into the lanes.  They were better off making her blind and retarded, which would have been much more realistic than a girl who repeated walked back and forth through highway lanes for no apparent reason.  Of course, all the Spanish drivers were too much in a hurry for, I dunno, any of them to stop or *gasp* slow down because a idiot girl keeps walking into traffic.  Of course, her equally stupid mother is off on the side of the road encouraging our female Magoo to cross even more lanes and come over.

Much of the movie felt forced and contrived like this scene.
