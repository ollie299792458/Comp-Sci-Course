This is a great movie and I would concur with the reviewer who said that it would have been phenomenally successful, if weren't a "foreign" movie.  The story of the friendship between an older man and his younger prot&eacute;g&eacute;e is wonderfully handled.  I was struck by how this movie explores what it is like for men to be platonically intimate in a way you almost never see in American movies.  This closeness between the two main characters, makes the later tension between them much more powerful as well as much more believable.  The woman's character is multilayered.  Her complex feelings for these men as well as her missing husband, is messy, which is the way in which man real-life relationship can be, particularly in the context of the trauma of war.

While this is a war movie, it is by no means just a war movie.  It really is a movie about mature human relationships, with all the nuances and complexities that they bring.  It's a story about characters that I come to like and believe are real and their struggles with love (both platonic and romantic), loyalty, and loss.  This might be one of those ultimate "date" flicks: enough action for most guys, but not too much for most gals; enough relationship stuff for most gals, but not too mushy for most guys. A nice balance and a great movie.
