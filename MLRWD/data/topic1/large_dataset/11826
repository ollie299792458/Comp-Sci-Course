This is a film that filmmakers dream of doing in their lifetime let alone at such an early film. "Mean Streets" like most of Scorsese's films is not about Crime but about America and the human soul and whats its  capable of doing when faced with the absurd.
  "Mean Streets"  is a simple story of new york italian thugs. The Charectors are all  struggling with interinal conflicts and when trouble comes they let it out.  Not alot of filmmakers in American can deal with subjects like these as  power as Scorsese can.
  The film stared two amazing actors in their  early careers. Robert DeNiro never had to grow up in Scorsese's films, he  knew what he was doing and this film shows it clearly. The second actor was  Harvey Keitel and this could possibley be his best roll. The film truley  sparks when both actors are put together in full force and display true raw  emotion.
  Martin Scorsese is possibley the best American director and  anyone who is a fim fan needs to see all his films and study them  carefully.
