The film High Fidelity is about a Rob Gordon, a man who owns a record store and has just broken up with his girlfriend. What follows is a trip through his "top five worst break ups" and everything inbetween.

The best part of the film though is the interaction between the cast. John Cusack got his first and only Golden Globe nomination with this movie and the lovable Rob. Then you have his instore employees Dick and Barry played by Todd Louiso and JAck Black. Black is absolutely hilarious and  Todd gets Dicks quiet and odd personality down to a tee. The film is also blessed with some great cameos by the always beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones as one of Rob's many girlfriends, Lili Taylor as another of Rob's girlfriends and Tim Robbin in a terrifcly memorable role as Ian, a old laid back hippy who has taken away Rob's newest girlfriend.

The film is based off Nicl Hornby's book of the same name. While certain things have been remove here and there the rewrite of the story is wonderful. I don't even like to use the word rewrite even.

And of coarse I cannot mention the film without talking about the soundtrack. With music from The Kinks, Smog, Jack Black, Bob Dylan, and Elvis Costello this film has one of the greatest soundtracks I can think of. No movie collection is really complete without this film.
