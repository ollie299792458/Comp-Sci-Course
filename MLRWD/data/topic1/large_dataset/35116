You always hear that Ridley Scott knows how to do the whole 'deluxe special collector's edition' DVD thing.

Well James Cameron is no slouch either.

ALIENS, the sequel to sci-fi/horror milestone ALIEN, is presented here in one of the finest DVD releases of any film.  As great as the film itself is, the features and extras on this DVD really make the set.  Disc one offers fans the original theatrical release of the film or the Extended Version, which includes approximately 17 minutes of extra footage, including the colonial Marines' robot-sentry guns, a look at Newt's family and Hadley's Hope before the xenomorphs arrive, and several other great new scenes.  Some other great movies(in my opinion, Amadeus is a fine example) can become tiresome upon their extension in a Director's Cut format, but ALIENS never slows down or has a dull moment, even amidst all of the extra footage.

The extras don't stop with the film itself, however.  The DVD's Disc 2 also features fine documentaries on the film-making process, from pre-production, to production, to post-production, including several interviews with the film-makers and cast.  The documentaries offer a plethera of insight into the film's creation, as we watch about how Fox wanted to write out Ripley's character, Sigourney Weaver's hatred for firearms, Michael Biehn's late arrival, and many other interesting aspects of the film's conception.

My first exposure to ALIENS was through this Collector's Edition DVD, and it almost immediately became my favorite film of all time.  The story, the acting, the action, the great quotes(Eat this!), the music, and every other little facet of the film will draw you in for a great sci-fi/action ride that you won't regret embarking on.
