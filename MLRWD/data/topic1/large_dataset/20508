As an amateur historian and reenactor of the Texas Colonial Period, I cannot recommend the is film as a historical documentary. The characters are all fictional accounts of actual people...some who were there and some  who were not...their characterizations fabricated and the military tactical  sequences totally incorrect.
But looking at the film as an action film  using the Alamo as a backdrop, I found it very entertaining. When I first  saw this film many years ago, before I learned the details about the Texas  Revolution and the Alamo role,I thought the action scenes were the best.  Americans of larger  proportions manhandling small insignificant soldiers  in droves was typical of the World War II Hollywood movies from the 40's  and 50's I loved as a kid. Later in my college film classes, I would learn  they were called propaganda films. And I would shed the influence of  exciting Hollywood versions of real events as support of understanding and  knowledge.
That being said, I think therefore this film must be given its  due as an exciting fictionalized American action film borrowing from well  known American legendary perceptions to add to the flavor.
