The show Good Christian Belles "GCB" is a very entertaining show. A great storyline with some really talented actors/actresses. I am a huge fan of Kristin Chenoweth and she is so good in this show. Anybody that has seen Kristin perform can attest she can play comedy or drama with the best of them. As for the opportunities she got to sing on the show, well those were spectacular! Kristin Chenoweth and singing is as natural for her as breathing is for everybody else. I always say .."A SONG has no better friend than Kristin Chenoweth!". ABC had a wonderfully gifted performer and set her and crew aside. Remember Pushing Daisies, that was another great show by ABC, only to exit out way too early. GCB was a show with a very believable plot and a very talented bunch indeed. I thought all played off of each other well and there was plenty of growth there for a young show. Many shows have slow starts (although I personally don't think of this one in that way). Annie Potts is a great actress. Leslie Bibb was really good in her part as well. They were so many good actors that played their parts well with some pretty good lines scattered in also. I still think Kristin Chenoweth is a real HOOT when it comes to comedy. The one-liners are priceless. When you use the term CHARACTERS in the show, they sure were that. That's a great reason for buying this treasure. I hope ABC will rethink there cancellation of this show and bring it back for a second season. You would think ABC would give a series two or possibly three seasons to show it's stuff, I know there is enough money invested in it to warrant a chance. I think it is more important than ever for a fan of this show to buy this season one, if anything to show ABC the potential for future sells is very much alive!  This is a great purchase!
