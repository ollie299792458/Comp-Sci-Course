Schindler's List
Though you see Oscar Schindler in most of this film's scenes, he
is primarily the narrator of this story, because the film is less
about him than it is about triumph of the human spirit and survi-
ving at a time when survival wasn't even one of the options.
He is portrayed by Neeson as cold and calculating, motivated
only by the expectation of windfall profits, but as the film unfolds,
the viewer witnesses his uneasy transition to that of a man
haunted by the horrors of mindless genocide. In the film's most
poignant moment, Oscar witnesses the obliteration of the Warsaw
ghetto through the eyes of one little girl, desparately seeking
a way out--but finding none. It is in this moment that WE see
all too clearly the single-minded ruthlessness with which the
Nazis' pursued the complete extermination of European jews.
And what we discovered in this cinematic journey is that Oscar
Schindler was a man who failed at every thing he ever tried to
accomplish, except for the ONE thing he was truly meant to do.
