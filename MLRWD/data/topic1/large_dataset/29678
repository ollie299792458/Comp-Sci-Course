The Birth of a Nation was a silent film made in 1915 by D.W.Griffith. I ordered one copy, to start of with, but instead got the Reel Enterprises version. While I enjoyed the film very much, I had some problems. First, the company kept it's logo at the bottom right of the screen for some reason, which kind of annoyed me throughout the film. Second, the projection speed was WAY too fast. I barely got time to read the titles, and if I did finish them, I was not given much time to soak in the message. This left me sometimes confused as to what was happening. Third, the audio was HORRIBLE! It had breaks right in the middle of important parts, and sounded like an old VHS audio track would sound like during the entire time. In fact I could swear that is probably where they got it. I was so disappointed with this copy, and at first I even wondered if I had gotten a bootleg version by some sick twist of fate.
I am actually surprised to see that the distributors here want to sell their version for way over the price I paid on the other version. Please, if you want to but this great silent film, buy another version, and do not get it used, you may get the Reel Enterprises version by mistake!
