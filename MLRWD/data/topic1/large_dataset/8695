My family and I loved this movie (but then we have been Disney movie fans for a long time).  The music was fun, the energy vibrant and the bad guy was reprehensible and evil - as usual!

For the people who didn't like this film, or make an issue about this movie not being family oriented, what the heck?  Cruella Deville - hideous to look at; AND even worse, she wanted to make coats out of those cute little dalmatian puppies.

The dark, beautiful, evil and ULTRA vain woman in Sleeping Beauty scared me to death as a child.  That woman wasn't messing around.  The fact that she turned into this deceptively 'sweet' old woman was even scarier because, who would be afraid of a sweet old woman?

I'm kind of hoping these negative reviews about this movie isn't what I think it is.  I've already read one ignorant post mentioning color, even going so far to mention the scatter brained white people in the movie.

Seriously?  Princess and the Frog was original and typical of Disney films - all of them fun and a joy to watch!
