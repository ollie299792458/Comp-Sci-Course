*Se7en* is screenwriter Walker's "love letter" to the city of New York.  And what a wonderful love letter it turns out to be!
The acting is all around superb.  Fincher's directing is brilliant.  The portrayal of modern city life and human relations is very much on the mark - apathy.  The extra features on the DVD have turned out to be very, very interesting thus far.
The problem?  The ending.  It doesn't make sense.  The first five deaths are supposedly because of the victims' own vices.  The last two are because of someone else's vices.  That alone makes the ending a disappointment - it seems that it was more for shock value than substance.  Which is really too bad considering the great substantiative dialogue and interaction that occurs just previous to the finale.
Walker should have spent more time coming up with an ending that actually fit with the rationale of the first five murders.  The ending that he came up with is a let down.
Other than that, the movie is superb.  Five stars.  Enjoy on an empty stomach :)
