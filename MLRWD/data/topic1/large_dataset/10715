This 1990 soccer World Cup concert, which launched the Three Tenors phenomenon, has a beautiful open air setting at the Caracalla Baths in Rome.  This means however, a loss of acoustics.  Orchestral sounds that would be enriched by a little reverberation literally drift away on the evening breeze.  But the singing is excellent.  They sing 4 solos each, then - after a sinfonia, or orchestral interlude - 3 more as a trio; 16 tracks in all.  All three singers are perfectly at ease in the Romance languages, but struggle with German and English, sometimes quite badly.  In the worst example, 'Maria' from West Side Story, Pavarotti bellows, "Say it soft and it's almost like praying".  Well, we'll have to take his word for it.

Despite these imperfections, the DVD remains a joyous celebration of some very fine singing and is well worth a look and a listen.

If you are yet to experience a Three Tenors concert, you might prefer to start with the 1994 Dodgers Stadium performance, when the soccer championship came to the US.  That has more songs and is a slicker, more professional affair.  It also has a celebrity audience, including Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, who are honored during the concert.
