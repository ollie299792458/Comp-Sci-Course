I rented the DVD to Mission to Mars and I wasn't expecting very much because of all of the negative reviews. Well this movie blew me away not only for the fact that Disney would put their name on this but that it was rated PG. This should have been a PG-13 pushing R so don't let the rating fool you. Some very gruesome deaths occur including a guy frozen in space and a guy who blows up into thousands of pieces. The special effects were great too. One of my favorite effects scenes showed the evolution of all animals overall, but there were definitely a lot more effects than that. The acting wasn't that bad either. Actually it was a lot better than another recent really bad sci-fi space movie, Supernova. Rent Mission before Supernova or the second can be skipped all together. Interesting storyline, but only an ok ending. Get this movie. At least rent it. It was especially added to my collection because of a great documentary and a great commentary. You won't be disappointed with this one. If only people hadn't gone into the movie hoping for it to be Apollo 13 which I thought was good but definitely something I don't want to see very much again. Think more along the lines of Armageddon, but change the asteroid part with mishap on Mars. Just as good if not better!
