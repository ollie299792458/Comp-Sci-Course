I just love, love, love this film. It's been one of my favorites since the early 1990's when I snagged it off cable on video tape. This 5 start DVD collection is tops in that not only is the transfer of the film fantastic, but the special features within are fantastic too. I thoroughly enjoyed the documentary on the making of MASH and how they had to go to great lengths to keep their vision of the movie intact and they succeeded handsomely IMO.

One of my favorite scenes is when they raise the walls of the showers while Major Hot Lips Hoolihan was inside and she falls and her outburst afterwords is just priceless, also the scene before that where she makes out to Major Burns and it gets broadcast all over the camp, also a priceless scene.

True, the film is based on the book of the same name, but about the Korean War and MASH the movie, is as much about Vietnam as it was about Korea as far as the war is concerned. I love the grittiness of the film, the overlapping dialogue and such, all ground breaking stuff back in 1969-1970.

Overall, this deluxe DVD package is well worth the price for what it contains.
