'Legally Blonde' is a hilarious and clever comedy. It is the story of a young sorority girl named Elle Woods. The movie begins to the song "Perfect Day" which really sets the mood. Elle is going out with a handsome, smart guy named Warner Huntington. Thinking he is going to propose to her, she buys a 'perfect' dress and meets him at the fancy restuarant he is taking her to, only to find out he is dumping her because he is going to Harvard Law School and wants to start a more serious life. Elle is heartbroken and devastated, so when she reads about a woman who is more Warner's 'serious type', she decides she is going to go to Harvard to so she can win him back!

I'm not going to give away all the good parts, but I must tell you, if you are wanting to get a fresh, funny, and totally blonde kind of movie, RENT (if you have not seen it yet) OR BUY THIS! You will laugh and if your a sensitive kind of person maybe even cry too. The acting is great, although I think the Warner guy could have done better. But Reese Witherspoon, being the great actress she is, totally makes this movie totally perfect!

If your a girl between the ages of 13 and up, you'll definitely love this. It's a really girly, chick flick type movie basically about a girl who goes very far for her man. Guys, on the other hand, well, if your a really tough type, you probably won't be that interested. :). It's a five star movie and one of my faves (I'm 13). You need to see it!
