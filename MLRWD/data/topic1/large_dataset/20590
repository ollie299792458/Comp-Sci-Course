Fans of Shirley Jackson's classic novel "The Haunting of Hill House" will remember that the story had a genuine frisson quality to it, as did the 1963 film starring Julie Harris and Claire Bloom. Those of  you who are expecting an improvement in either are going to be sorely  disappointed (as I was) in this laughable re-make. The gargantuan set was  overly done and the producers obviously wasted an AWESOME amount of money  on mostly meaningless special effects which, I suspect were meant to give  the picture "shock value" Liam Neeson gives a lifeless and  uninspired performance and Luke Sanderson is ridiculousy portrayed by Owen  Wilson. I like Lilli Taylor and think she's a decent actress, but her  playing of Eleanor was not effective, the fault of which lies mainly in the  stupidly written script which makes the audience laugh in all the wrong  places. There was no "Great-Grandmother" in the original story at  all and this makes the film ludicrous as does the insinuation that Hugh  Crain is beezlebub himself-he was responsible in the torturing souls of God  knows HOW many children?-Implausible and utterly unconvincing, this movie  is a sad ,sorry filmization of a potentially terrifying story (it could  have been more truly chilling on a quarter of the budget!) Grotesquely  overblown, poorly acted and written, the movie leaves ASOLUTELY NOTHING to  the imagination which any ten-year old knows is where real creepiness  begins. Catherine Zeta-Jones's beauty was the BEST thing in the whole show.  Shirley Jackson's masterpiece deserves better, more THOUGHT OUT treatment  than this hodgepodge;it would help to follow the original story-these new  Hollywoodisms STINK! .
