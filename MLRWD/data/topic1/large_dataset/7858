If i was Wes Craven i would sue the film makers of this putrid  film or at least state publicly that i hated this movie..There were no sympathetic characters, everyone acted as if they were the most stupid people on Earth...Let me count the ways...College girl(i will not mention character names because they don't deserve any recognition)who is a city girl..smokes pot with her dumb pal convience store girl in a hotel room that is littered with clothes with a boy they just met..  and they don't question him on any level about who else was occupying the room..and after getting stoned..they hang out instead of leaving..so they end up dead.. ..The hotel is the first place losers go to hide after they murder 2 policemen..yeah, right..and the cops never check those places out either..the rest of the movie is more of the same dumb dialog.Mom and dad are something else...total buffoons..that let nasty scum bags into their house..that is secluded and far from anything..they slowly take their time taking revenge..to the point of being laughable....would you believe the killers were out camping? No, i wouldn't either..i watched hoping something interesting would happen but it never did...and who was the sexual violence for? Not me..not reeled slowly for the sake of showing the brutality of the Killers murdering and raping, why show it? ..for the audience  I hope not..."Last House on The Left" is probably the last re-make i will watch..I do not recommend this movie..watch Wes Cravens original..and his other movies too..plus check out "The House by the Cemetary"..Hello Hollywood ..let me make a movie that will scare the hell out of people...i work within budgetary constraints.
