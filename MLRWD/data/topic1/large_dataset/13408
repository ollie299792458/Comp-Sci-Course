When I first heard about this movie, I was told "it's just another 'guy' flick" and advised not to go see it. Well, I ignored that advice and I'm darn glad I did cos it's a great movie! Although the plot is a little weak, the strong cast holds it together and makes it a movie worth watching. Brian is instantly suspicious and the explaination for his behaviour is no big surprise. What is a shock is who is behind the truck robberies; although the suspicion is there the film makers throw the viewer a few red herrings to throw you off the scent. The two female leads are so vastly different that complement each other perfectly and the "team" is so diverse that you never quite know where they're coming from. A bunch of nice cars, and nice bikes, adds the finishing touch to an intimate look at the illegal street racing scene of today's American youth.
If you're not sure rent the movie rather than buying it but WATCH IT as it's a great movie with a wondferful cast.
And there's always Vin Diesel with his shirt off for the ladies to look at ;-&gt;
