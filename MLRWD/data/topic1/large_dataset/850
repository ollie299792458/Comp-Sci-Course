Wow. That's the only word that comes to mind. I have never before seen a better romance in my life. The beautifully rendered tale of love about a "Trick" gone bad will certainly touch the soul. I don't know what  I can say that already hasn't been. The story follows the trail of two gay  men looking for a one night stand, a "trick." Unfortunately for  them, everything seems to be trying to stop them from consumating this  fling and in the process of trying to find a suitable place, they realize  that there's more underlying this relationship than lust. Together they  discover the troubles with love, distrust, and the fear of settling down.  Through the trouble of finding the right place to "do each  other," they learn much about each other and ultimately find the  romance missing in both their lives. In a great drama lightly sprinkled  with humor, the acting is superb. Campbell plays the shy, silent guy,  completely opposite of Pitoc's outgoing, party-til-you-drop, hunky go-go  boy, perfectly and Tori Spelling plays a wonderful ditzy best friend. Pitoc  does his job to the dot, and Ms. Coco Peru is the slightly needed backup  humor that brings the whole thing together. No matter who you are, you  gotta' love this movie.
