Shoot, I have to admit it... I absolutely love this film, even though I'm sure I've watched it about a 1,000 times.

Without a doubt, it's a work of celluloid art. I think it works so well because it does not try to be anything that it isn't- it's got the necessary shamelessly tacky romance- and has a wonderfully predictable plot, yet it's never boring.

Frankly, I think that most folks; if they're being honest, are naturally attracted to the 'great struggle' in film and literature. Where something really, REALLY scary and evil is soundly beaten by something small and unexpectedly potent, and as a result: all that we know and love is saved from extinction. Ah! The classic story of HOPE.

But for sure the BEST parts of this movie are the WAY cool special effects. For instance... Check out Gene Barry's Horn Rim glasses! Lawdy! Those things are PURE scary!  Then there's Ann Robinson's perfect 1950's sci-fi shrieky scream... not to mention the horror of her Hair... MY LANDS, Girl, you should have gotten SOME kind of film industry honor for that 'Doo!

Oh, and of course, WHO could ever get enough of those wonderfully terrifying alien ships slowly cruising over the landscape, zapping everything in sight!? That image gave me nightmares for weeks as a kid; so did the distinctive sound of the deadly Martian rays... They'll echo through the dark corridors of my mind for probably as long as I live!

Yeah, so, in my opinion... without a doubt, everyone who even sort-of, just a little bit, maybe kinda likes '50's Sci-Fi films needs this little beauty in their collection. Can't loose, here, folks!
