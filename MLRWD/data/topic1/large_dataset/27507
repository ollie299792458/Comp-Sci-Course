I would really like to give this movie infinite stars! It blows my mind every time I watch it. The acting is impeccable; Dustin Hoffman's genius is even more apparent in retrospect while Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson  resounds with fullness and contradiction. The writing is both hilarious and  wrenching and the cinematography, while wildly creative, is not at all  distracting or self-conscious. The perfect pairing of these components with  the incredible Simon and Garfunkle soundtrack make for the most nuanced,  subtle, and serendipitous film I have ever seen. I have seen this movie  innumerable times and it never fails to surprise me with a previously  unnoticed gesture, squeak, or breath contributing to the overall genius.  Finally, all of this would be superflous if the movie did not have the  enormous soul that it does. The flawless artistry of its production has  produced an immortal story that transcends the medium of film. This movie  changed my life and I recommend it to absolutely everyone.
