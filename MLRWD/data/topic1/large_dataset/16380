Having been more than a little disappointed with the lack of action in the first installment this movie did not let me down. The sequel improves on the original maybe three times over. The original X-Men have all returned, with Iceman having a more significant part, but the Brotherhood is missing Toad and Sabertooth (if anyone knows why please email me). The new additions to the roster are the fire-totting, hot tempered Pyro and the teleporting Nightcrawler. There is not a dull moment. From the assault on the White House in the opening scene to the Climax at the Weapon X facility in Canada. The basic plot is that Stryker has begun a campaign to destroy mutant kind and the mutants must unite to fight for their lives. One thing people who have seen the first one will notice is that this movie is much more brutal. X-Men and Brotherhood alike tally up a high body count. If your like me you were expecting cameos from Gambit and Beast, but unfortunately neither are anywhere in sight, but the movie does feature a short, but memorable, scene with Colossus. Expect larger roles for Colossus and Jubilee, who made a brief, non-active appearance. Comic Book fans will have a basic idea of what will happen in the next movie. Basically, go see it.
