This movie is one of those rare films that manages to capture some of lives deeper truths without getting heavy handed.  This love story is entertaining mostly due to the fine script and outstanding performances by Anthony Hopkins, Debra Winger (Terms of Endearment, An Officer and a Gentleman) , and Joseph Mazzello (Jurassic Park, Simon Birch).  Hopkins plays the mature C.S. Lewis (The Narnia Chronicles, The Four Loves).  Even though Oxford professor Lewis has converted to Christianity, he has built a world where no one can touch him emotionally.  His relationships with everyone, even his brother and closest friends, are nothing more than intellectual acquaintances.
Enter Joy Gresham and her young son Douglas.  Douglas is an avid Lewis fan from reading the Narnai books.  Both mother and child enter Lewis' world, oblivious to the walls Lewis has erected to protect his own emotions.  The resulting drama is one of the finest movies available.  This is English cinema at its best.  Particularly noteworthy is George Fenton's moving score.  His original compositions for the film are worth a listen on their own, and one of my favorite soundtracks ever.  In the tradition of Vaughn-Williams, Butterworth, and Parry - his music stands with other British 20th century romantics.
This beautiful film was directed by Sir Richard Attenborough (Gandhi, Jurassic Park), and shows us Hopkin's genius as an actor, making much more use of his talent than we've seen in recent years.  This is a tear jerker, but still highly recommend.
