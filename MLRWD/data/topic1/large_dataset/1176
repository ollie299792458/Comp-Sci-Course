As stated in the title, director Ron Howard has beautifully pieced together, in what is, essentially, a 2 hour boxing match. In one corner is Michael Scheen, who plays up-and-coming British talk show host, David Frost. And in the other corner, is Richard Nixon; the most despised man in the American political system, at the time.

As the movie progresses, and Frost gets an idea to stage an interview with Nixon (at which he pays an extravagant amount of money for), it is clear that Frost is overly confident, and not sure of what he is facing in Nixon.

As the interviews progress, the tides turn in favor of Frost. He gains the upper hand and exposes Nixon's weakest front...the Watergate scandal!

Ron Howard does an excellent job of giving a non-biased view of the event. Actually, the film portrays Nixon in a good light. Personally, I felt sad and sorry for Nixon, because it was obvious he was not a good public speaker, and not good with people.

A very good movie. If it was possible to give this movie a 4.5/5, I would. However, since it is not possible, I have to give Frost/Nixon a 4/5.
