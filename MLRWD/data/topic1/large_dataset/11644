I saw this film in the movie house shortly after it first opened, in Chicago, Illinois.  The film has haunted me ever since.  I have decided to purchase the film at this time.  I want it to be part of my permanent collection of memorable films.
This is basically the story of a bureaucrat, not an intellectual.  He is a man who makes his living as a bailiff who conducts foreclosures at the order of the local court.  His business often requires him to remove the person's property from a real estate location.  As a bailiff, he is allowed to keep the percentage of the property value as a fee for his services on behalf of the court.  It seems cruel.  This is not the sort of occupation that someone goes to college in order to become.  In the course of his private life, he has a sexual liaison with his housekeeper, who is as stern a personality as he is himself.  One would not call the liaison a rape exactly, however there is a very large element of pressure from him in the matter.  She becomes pregnant.  When he discovers that, he proposes to marry her, but he does so in a very dry and forced way.  She declines the offer.  Neither of them are very warmhearted people.  The child born of the relationship is a beautiful child.  That's the beginning of the story.  The remainder of the story is the interaction of the father and the child at a very great distance.  By the end of the film one has gotten a very clear idea of character in a human being.  I will not spoil the movie further by revealing more details.  However, if you see this film with a receptive attitude, it will be one of the 10 films that change your life. pws, Chicago.
