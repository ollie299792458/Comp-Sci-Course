Cameron Crowe's "Singles" portrays the lives of single men and women living in Seattle, Washington in the 1990s.  Like previous generations, the youth are seeking independence and identity.  The movie centers around a couple Steve and Linda, played by Kyra Segwick and Campbell Scott.  They first meet at a concert and she, Linda, rejects him on the spot.  Then they meet again the second time and she accepts him.  They both start off awkwardly and then they grow on one another.  But things take a turn which makes one question the other where the relationship is going.
The supporting actors Briget Fonda and Matt Dillon make the movie are just as good as the center characters.  Fonda, who plays a waitress, tries to get Dillon's attention.  He is more focused on his music career while working as a delivery truck guy for a florist shop.  She attempts to get a boob job to get his attention.
Then there is a neighbor who is an advertising exec that is searching for her "prince".  She goes through a dating service hoping to get her man.  Despite her schemes, she is optimistic.
This movie is a good watch as the couples are going through some odds and ends in the relationships and creating lifetime of friendships.
