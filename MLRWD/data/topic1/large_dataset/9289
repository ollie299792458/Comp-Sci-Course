First of all - let me tell you that I put Talented Mr. Ripley in my top ten movies of all time (yes- a much better film than Purple Noon in my opinion).  When I first heard about Cold Mountain, I waited well over a year in sheer excitement at the repairing of these two fantastic filmmakers.  Needless to say - the experiment met with Minghella's overambition, Jude Law's horrible southern accent, and Nicole Kidman's incredibly flat performance (especially in comparison to the other females Zellweger and Portman in the film).

Breaking and Entering, sadly, is even more of a letdown than Cold Mountain.  Minghella puts all his eggs (meaning time and high quality actors) into a story that just doesn't seem to leave much of an impact on you.  And it's a long movie as well.

* Beware of a spoiler here - but there is what is supposed to be a very dramatic scene near the end of the movie where Robin Wright Penn finally realizes her husband is awful (a fact the audience has been aware of for quite a while at this point), explodes on him, and then is far too quickly reconciled with her husband by some cutesy posh Englishman desperation.  At this point in the film I felt totally disconnected from these people emotionally and felt the film completely dropped the ball.  You just don't buy it, and boy am I glad I saw this film in my monthly Blockbuster package for less than a dollar!
