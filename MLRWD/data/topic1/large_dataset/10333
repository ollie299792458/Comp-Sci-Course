i have bought a few gay-themed movies lately, and must say i liked most of them very well (Tales,The Trip,Longtime Companions,The Band played on,Gods and Monsters,etc....)

This one, however, was a total dissappointment, unfortunately.

with the exception of the 3 male leads, the acting was very poor, over the top and very unbelievable. the female love-interest is annoying throughout the entire film, someone you just want to slap -and hard!

and when she finally becomes the nasty bitch you suspect she really is, at the end, she still gets the guy -i found it hard to believe someone would be stupid enought to still fall for her, the way she she disrespectfully treats everyone around her.

though i had hopes the movie would eventually pick up and turn into a decent story, i never felt particularly amused and had no laughs.the sex-scene was hard to swallow (no pun intended)and though you get to see the two sexy leads dicks, it didn't make up for anything.also, whether straight or gay, it would be nice to see some people kissing and actually be able to buy the passion they are supposed to sell on the screen.the "gay-love-confession" at the end was very lame.

"the opposite of sex", for example, dealt with a similar theme, but was very believable, and sporting a terrific cast of talented actors.

unfortunately, in my opinion,this movie didn't.
