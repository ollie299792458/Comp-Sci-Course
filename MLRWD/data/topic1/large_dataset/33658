This double feature gives us a good opportunity to watch Hedy Lamarr (who was said to be the most beautiful woman in the world) at the peak of her career. Once accepted that she has a flamboyant beauty, but limited acting skills, both films manage quite well to strengthen the advantages and to detract from the disadvantages. In my opinion, "Dishonored Lady" does it better. This typical psychological film noir is a permanent style extravaganza - note that one character says about the Lamarr character that she is "as beautiful as a PICTURE". Her character always being a little insecure as a "two-faced woman", Lamarrs deficiency as an actress perfectly fits the role! Long before his Disney career, director Robert Stevenson was a fine stylist of expressionist noir, i.e. in "Jane Eyre" - and in "Dishonored Lady".

"The Strange Woman" is a somehow labored period picture about a (very, very) bad girl in Bangor, Maine, in the first half of the 19th century. Jenny (Lamarr) ist decided to climb the social ladder at any price, which makes her seduce and destroy more than one man (e.g. Louis Hayward and George Sanders). It's strongly entertaining and has some fascinating scenes, but different from "Dishonored Lady", the film does explain too much in the dialogue. It is always good when we can SEE what Jenny does, instead of being told. However, we have some interesting exercises in style, symbolism and lighting - but not as constantly as in "Dishonored Lady". The picture is directed by Edgar Ulmer, and Douglas Sirk is said to have done some additional directorial work.

I would rate "The Strange Woman" four stars and "Dishonored Lady" five stars.
