I first encountered the original 1980's Night of the Demons last year while I was couch surfing my TV providers On-demand. I'm a huge horror fan and can usually find the good elements of film even if the director was Uwe Bolle....

Anyway, I don't know if the original was just that amazing or if it was because I wasn't expecting much from an 80s horror film, which obviously doesn't have the special effects as today's movies, but I absolutely LOVED it. It was a few months after I saw the original I heard rumors of a remake which got me excited. So of course I pre-ordered the movie, unfortunately amazon shipped the wrong item to me on the release date but their customer service is the best I've experienced so kudos to amazon for making things right.

Once the movie came in, I invited my good friend over to watch it. Unlike me, he never saw the original film. If you are looking to buy this film, I will give you the same warning I gave my friend, I consider this to be a fun B-rated horror movie that was filmed knowing it was a "b-rated" film. Don't expect to get scared but expect to have a good time when watching it. The acting was so-so, but I think that is also because some of the writing was lacking. The only actor who I thought was terrible was Edward Furlong. I mean his lines were pretty dreadful to watch but I didn't let that bother me during my viewing. I completely agree with the reviewer below me that Furlong looks like a "bloated reject from Fraggle Rock." One thing this movie really did get right was the soundtrack as it blended well with some of the scenes.

Remember this movie didn't have the funding like the mainstream franchises and this movie never saw a theater. Bottom line, if you don't expect too much from this film, and you go into it knowing its a B-rated film, you will have a good time.
