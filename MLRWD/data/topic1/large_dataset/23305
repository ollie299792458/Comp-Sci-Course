I love this film and watch it every year. The movie (set in WW2 America) stars Barbara Stanwyck as Elizabeth Lane, who writes a successful magazine article about her life in Connecticut. She lives on a farm, she has a husband and a baby, and she's a great cook and housewife! Or is she? In truth, she makes up everything in her articles, and her Hungarian friend, Felix, (a real master chef) sends her recipes to put in her articles. Her editor, Dudley, knows this. Her publisher, Mr. Yardley, does not. So one christmas, Mr. Yardley asks Elizabeth to entertain a hospital-striken sailor at her farm over the holidays. To make things worse, Mr. Yardley, feeling lonely for the holidays, decides to come to the farm as well. Not knowing what to do, her suitor, Mr John Sloane (works as an architect) offers to let her use the farm he owns in Connecticut, Nora, the housekeeper, will take care of the housekeeping and Felix volunteers to come and do the cooking. But even with an experienced crew, this plan seems to have "Titanic" written all over it (it seems doomed to fail). Humorous dialog, loveable characters, an old-fashioned christmas spirit, and a couple of annoying people whose halls you would love to deck (Sloane), make Christmas in Connecticut great holiday fun for the young and young at heart.
