I was introduced to this documentary in a college class and I've watched it 3x since then.  Each time I watch it I see something else in the story I missed the first time.

This story will shock you, make you cry, make you laugh and mostly (I hope) move you to action.  It's the story about the Sudanese (Lost)boys who walked thousands of miles to Kenya because in the early 1980's there was an order by the government to kill all boys no matter what their age.  These 1000's of boys walked with the shirt (and sometimes no shirt) on their back, barefoot, starving, emanicipated and emotionally wiped out to a Kenya refugee camp.  The things they experienced and witnessed are hard to imagine.  It's a story where their is proof that suffering really brings strength to a person's spirit.

The docementary focuses on 3 of them (Panther, John & Daniel) who get selected to go to the USA after spending 15 years in the refugee camp.  It's their story of struggles, their adaptation to American culture and their hopes and dreams.  They are truly inspirational.

I guarantee this story will touch your heart!

Thank you to the producers of this story for bringing the complete atrocity of Sudan to the light!

Today, Sudan's president has been accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. I can't help but think this documentary aided in getting the publicity of this injustice!

Watch the movie...it will change you (for the good) forever!

If you are a professor teaching a multicultural or international cultures class, this documentary would fit into your curriculm easily. It examines the culture of the Sudanese and then explores the culture of America from the perspective of the Sudanese culture.
