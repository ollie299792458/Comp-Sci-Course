It is extremely annoying when a title is re-released in Blu-ray format with no restoration, or for that matter with no improvement on the image quality provided by the original DVD. Most films placed on Blu-ray stand out because of their crystal clear image and excellent sound. This makes it worth buying again, even if one possesses the original DVD copy, simply to have the improved performance on the screen, which may be even further enhanced by good quality equipment. This Blu-ray edition is far inferior to the original DVD edition, which used to have a number of interesting extras and the Blu-ray has absolutely none!

As to the film itself, in my opinion, it still rates as one of the best comedies ever to be produced for the cinema. A very clever story, by John Cheese, with tremendous dialogue and very good acting from all the principals. There are some exaggerations in the plot, but this is true of most comedies.

I noticed that the Blu-ray edition of this film will be released in the UK in August. I hope that after this long delay, this release will have the necessary improvements, especially in image quality, to make it worth a 5 star rating, and possibly induce one to acquire once more.
