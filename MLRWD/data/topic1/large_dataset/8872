More eloquent viewers than I have reviewed this classic, but I'll gladly put my two cents in as well.
If you have not seen this movie, please treat yourself and give it a try.  All of the actors do an excellent job.  Colin Clive as the brilliant Dr. Frankenstein, who allows his knowledge and creativity to carry him too far.  Dwight Frye as mean little Fritz, a part played to it's creepy hilt.  The first time I saw this film, Fritz scared me more than the "monster". Mae Clark as Dr. Frankenstein's fiance, forced to watch her true love descend into temporary madness, and unable to do anything about it.  And last but most certainly not least, the great Boris Karloff as the monster.  His is one of the greatest non-speaking roles I have ever witnessed.  He growls, but says not a word.  Yet he is able to convey a wide range of emotion through body posture, hand gestures, and though his facial expressions were limited due to heavy makeup, he manages it anyway.  Yes, his monster is frightening to a degree, but he also makes you feel pity for this poor creature--created by an unspeakable process, kept in the dark, unable to speak, and ultimately rejected by his creator.  The one friendship he makes ends tragically, and you must see this original, uncut version to understand what happens there.  It has always been my opinion that Boris Karloff should have won an Oscar for his performance as Frankenstein's monster.
