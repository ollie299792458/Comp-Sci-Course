My message to them: KEEP WATCHING! It gets better after a while. I was turned off at first and thought the show hadn't aged well - but once I got "into" the humor I found myself laughing hysterically. Most shows will rarely make me laugh when I'm watching alone. SNL sometimes does it when a skit strikes gold (which is getting rarer). Although they're not all hilarious, SCTV Vol. 1 has some downright hilarious skits that had me rolling on the floor in laughter, and often chuckling, BY MYSELF, which is very rare. John Candy's Yellow Belly skit was great. Woody Allen meets Bob Hope? Classic! John Candy's Farm Film Report detailing all the latest foreign films? Hysterical! ("They got blowed up real good!")
Sure, some of the skits are outdated. Unless you grew up during the '80s you might miss some stuff. But the truth is this has some of the funniest impersonations and sketch ideas you'll ever see in your lifetime. As Conan O'Brien says, "These very well may be the funniest DVDs you'll ever own. So, enjoy." I don't quite agree, but they are ONE of the funniest collections you'll get the chance to see.
It's a bit dated but stick with it - after an hour or so it suddenly turns downright hilarious and I can't stop watching it. I never realized how great Rick Moranis was at impersonations...
