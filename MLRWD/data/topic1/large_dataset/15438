I was expecting to be bored throughout much of this flick, as many of the reviews were negative. Surprisingly, this is a decent movie with some memorable scenes (did you call me a jive turkey?). I think what holds it back from the normal zaniness is the screenplay, which tends to stick to the formula of sports films -- aging player's redemption, young player learning how to be less selfish, and general team camaraderie. This requires more of an ensemble cast performance but without the regular craziness that surrounds Ferrell, he seems a bit too over the top in some cases (consider the 'love' story with Harrelson & Tierney -- the only thing strange about it is Corrdry's excitement that his girlfriend is cheating with a basketball player -- otherwise, it's typical love story.) David Koechner, who normally goes just as crazy in his roles, plays this one straight. It seems like Ferrell is the only one reaching for wackiness or the only one the director trusted to reach for wackiness.

In the end, it's all about expectations. If you want the level of wackiness found in Talledega (sp?) Nights or Anchorman, the movie will disappoint. If you go in knowing the movie has an uneven but essentially enjoyable, you'll be better off.
