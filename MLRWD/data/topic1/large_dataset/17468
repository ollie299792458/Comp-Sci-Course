If some of the past cartoon characters could write reviews it would probably go something like this....."UUUGH!" by Charlie Brown. "This Stinks Doc!" by Bugs Bunny. "Ha! Ha! I agree with Bugs" by Mickey Mouse. "This show makes Urban Chipmunk look like a winner." By Alvin, Theodore and Simon. "Yabba Dabba Doooo...not waste your hard earned cash!" by Fred Flintstone. I've got an idea to improve the show. Combine it with NBC'S Fear Factor. Instead of eating something nasty in the second stunt. Have all the contestants (including the host of Fear Factor) sit through an episode for American Dad. The contestant that can go the longest without hurling wins! But, then again nobody would win the fifty thousand dollars, because they would all be eliminated. This proves how out of control the FOX network is. They cancel great shows in the past like...Titus and Grounded For Life. But, keep the stinkers like American Dad. The only thing they ever did right was cancel "That 80's Show!" and "Greg the Bunny". Hopefully Fox Sports can work on OUSTING Ole D.W. for a NASCAR expert.
