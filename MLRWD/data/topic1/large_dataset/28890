I remember when i was little that I heard the Buck Rogers  Film was going to be in theaters.
Couldn't go cuz i was too young.
I'm very happy that the movie was made into a TV series & got hooked.
From Gil Gerard (Buck Rogers himself a jack of all trades)
From the comedy relief in Twiki voiced by the man of a thousand voice Mel Blanc.
To the good looking Erin Gray (Col.Deering)
For space dogfights, brawls, beautiful women, Buck Rogers was like a James Bond Sci Fi style.
Season 1 has the Femme Fetale in Princess Ardala of the Draconian Empire, Gun runners, Mad dictators,A Vampire, Kidnappers,Killer Androids, Buck was the man to put a stop to these villains.
Season 2 has a Star Trek Feel as Buck, Wilma & Twiki are on the Searcher to find the lost tribes of earth.
He neets  a future ally in Hawk (Thom Christopher) a survivor of ancient earth who fled to the stars centuries before.
Journeys take the crew to uncharted planets new species & more adventures.
Overall its worth every penny.
