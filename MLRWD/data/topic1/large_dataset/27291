In the end, who cares if it's a documentary, a massaged / recreated documentary, or a totally fake, scripted and ad-libbed film?  What's important is that it's a good story, well told.  It's not a big story - no-one dies - but it's a thoughtful and worthwhile story.

It takes a lot for me to enjoy a movie, and as I started watching it I definitely didn't like it.  Nev smiles too much, he lives a privileged lifestyle and he's too good looking and nice to be anything but annoying - at first.  But with excellent directing (which amounts mainly to excellent editing), intrigue quickly builds.  Are we heading into psycho, Blair Witch territory, or somewhere else?

Seriously, don't bother with the naysayers or those endlessly dissecting it.  Go with your gut.  Sit back, relax, watch the movie and, dare I say it, think a little too.

Then, afterwards, you can rack your brains trying to figure out whether it was real or fake or half-fake and half-real, or mostly-real-but-reshot-to-make-it-look-realer, or...
