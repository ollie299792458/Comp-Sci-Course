First, let me comment on the quality of episodes. I am a diehard audiophile and videophile.
I viewed EVERY episode in a dedicated sound treated room on a 10ft Stewart screen with Krell audio processing at EVERY stage, faroudja video processing and the flagship dreamvision DLP projector. 6 high end state of the art speakers delivered the audio to my ears.

Each and every detail including defects are amplified and visible. Despite this the audio quality was FAR superior to any episode one can see on TV . The audio quality is naturally stereo only, however, the episodes were not aired any other way except perhaps in mono.
The video quality had some transfer defects with obvious pixelization and occasional blurring during rapid movement. However, the effect is only midly annoying even on a 10ft screen.

Overall, given the origin of the episodes the video and audio quality is good and enjoyable.

Now, I would NOT buy this particular version. My suggestion is to purchase the gold edition which contains every episode ever aired with bonus features. I repeat it contains EVERY episode EVERY season. It is far more economical priced around 200USD. Any number of online retailers carry the gold edition.
