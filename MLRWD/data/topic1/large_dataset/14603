What can I tell? A number of my previous "moderately positive" stereotypes were smashed by this remarkable work. I loved Andrew L. Webber, though may be not all of his works equally ... I respected Alan Parker since "The Wall". I thought Madonna was "just a popstar", though - certainly - a very talented one... I thought that Antonio Banderas is just a good "action" actor... Yet with all due credits - I did not expect this... Personally, I "had a crash" on this movie...

Together, they made an Epic, a classic work going far beyond a specific (however important) page in Argentinian history, straight into the heart of someone born (like me) far away from this country. The scene, the script / lyrics, the music, the acting and voices of Madonna and Banderas - are really admirable. And together, they make you feel - wherever you are born & live - this story is (or at least may become) about YOUR OWN country, your own nation and people, your own love for it, your own part  in the Century XXth... This movie cannot be just "watched" on "enjoyed"- you really have to live through it...

My sinsere thanks to all who made this work of High Art.
