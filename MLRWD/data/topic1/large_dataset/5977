The DVD Series 500 Nations is an excellent educational series, it shows a very good background history of the plight of the Native peoples of the Americas. From the time of Cahokia, and Mayans, Aztecs,and the Incas. It gives a look into the way that the natives were treated by the Spanish and Portugese Invaders and the true story of Columbus which the United States educational system doesn't teach the American students, instead a holiday is set aside for Columbus and backed by the US Government. The series gives an outstanding look into the true relations and maltreatment by the United States Government, towards the Native Peoples from the first settlers to the modern Government of our country, this is a shameful reality for those of us of the Caucasion ethniticity. The series is excellent and loaded with beautiful scenery and vital information into US history, but it cuts off way to quickly at the turn of the 20th century. When in reality the story continues to unfold even today and I believe there should be a continuation of the series to show the story of the Modern Native Americans, both there hardships and their Good fortune in some cases.
