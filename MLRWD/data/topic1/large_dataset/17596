Definitely not what I had expected--but at the same time, Bernie fit the profile for a sociopath killer. In a lot of ways people (especially those from rural Texas, like myself), can identify with this movie; everything to the last detail is legit. The actors, with their real southern accents (that sometimes can sound TERRIBLY fake in a movie from an actor trying to portray a southern drawl), the overbearing presence of Christianity, the black and white morality...even down to the Big Red bottle sitting on DA Buck's table during the court trial. And even if you didn't grow up in Texas or the South, Bernie's sweet/borderline psychotic (perhaps justifiable) behavior will leave most people pondering: Is he really evil? Or did he only succumb to a moment of passionate rage towards an evil woman? And even then, one can only wonder about the gray areas of human compassion...how far do we extend our understanding towards someone we think we know? Must we always keep perspective as objective as possible??

Excellent film...I'm telling everyone I know about it!
