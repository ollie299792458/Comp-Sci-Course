When I finished watching the DVD, I knew.  I knew this was the greatest horror film out there - I have seen many - and I knew it would probably be the best horror film ever made.  That's right - ever.
Polanski's visionary work will have you in suspense from the beginning of the film.  Its tremendous reputation aside, the cinematography, timing, acting, and music come together in a terrifying way.  The film conveys the magical realism and suspension of disbelief in Ira Levin's book: while the actual plot of the movie is simple to figure out, the movie, through its slight twists and marginal revelations, makes you believe what is going on is plausible.  By the end of the film, you will know exactly what is going on, and an entirely implausible event leaves you speechless.
Afterwards, you'll shake your head, drink a vodka blush, and realize it was all a movie.  Some of you tough-guys might have been saying that all along.  But something about the film is chilling, something about the "God is dead" motif will strike you as real, and something about Rosemary's world will seem very much like our own.
Mia Farrow's performance is extraordinary and should have nailed her an Academy award (same goes for Polanski's debut directorial achievement, though he got his just desserts with The Pianist).  This movie, like other classics in their respective genres, are movies to be emulated and never quite duplicated in style or effect.  Even today, this movie could not have been done better, or with better casting.  The movie is masterfully directed, frightfully self-aware, and simultaneously realistic and fantastic.
The DVD is terrific.  Outstanding audio/video quality, superb special features including contemporary interviews.  An essential DVD for your library.  Not suitable for small children: unless they were rocked in an all-black cradle.
