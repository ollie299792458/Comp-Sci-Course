I have been a nightwish fan for years and I have owned end of an era for several years now also,It's one of my favorite live concerts out there and the last with Tarja,I have seen a few nightwish concerts and this one is the best i have seen for sound and picture,The entire band is spot on;)And comparing this Blu-ray to the standard dvd,well The picture isn't a whole lot better than the standard being the standard had a sorta washed out color look and thats not the blu ray's fault its the way the original was shot but on a good note the picture is sharper and color is abit better its not anamorpic widescreen like the standard was so its nice to have a full picture on my bigscreen its still widescreen just not anamorpic so no zooming ect needed for a full image,Sound is standard 5.1 or 2.0 so its the same as the standard dvd was which isnt terrible unless you want lcpm lossless hdmi TrueHD ect...But as for sound of the concert it rocks evem in 5.1;)All nightwish fans need to have this concert its one of there best and one i can watch over and over i have watched it 1000x and never get tire of seeing it,and its still a slight Improvement over the standard dvd and one of my favorite live shows ever;)
