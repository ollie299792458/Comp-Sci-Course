Is this Blu-ray transfer the 'stuff that dreams are made of?' Perhaps not, but there is a marked improvement on the DVD version. The strength of blacks is better and detail is much improved most noticeably in fabrics and glossy surfaces. Yes, some scenes still display that somewhat hazy, gauziness but it is the best it's ever looked to me. I think many of us are guilty of expecting Blu-rays of old films to present them in a clarity akin to us actually sitting on-set watching the actors with our own eyes - for a film made in 1941 we are being a little unrealistic in this regard! You shouldn't be disappointed in The Maltese Falcon.

On the other hand, the extras on this disc really are rubbish! The 'Warner Night At The Movies' is a combination of trailers and cartoons that 'recreate' a night at the movies in 1941. What drivel. Extras should have something to do with the main film. The One Magnificent Bird featurette is the best thing here. Make up tests? Tedious filler. A bloopers reel with loads of Cagney...What's that got to do with the Maltese Falcon? The three radio adaptations are relevant and the Becoming Attractions featurette cobbles together some Bogart trailers with a load of hyperbole that lacks any great insight but is at least about a guy in the Maltese Falcon.
