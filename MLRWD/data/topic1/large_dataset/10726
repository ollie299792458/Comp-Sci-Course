I started this program 1 1/2 weeks ago. Already I have experienced a 2 inch loss around my waist and 7 lbs of fat gone from my body. The workouts, while intense, only last 20 minutes. I can do that twice a week and the payoff is huge. My strength has increased easily by 50% and I have more energy than I know what to do with. I was sidelined for almost 3 years due to a sciatica related condition that seriously compromised my left leg and hip. I could not do any exercise that put pressure on the left hip and leg. I tried this program cautiously this month. Apparently I have finally healed and this program has given back to me the strength that I had lost during that 3 year period. My stability and balance are back to normal!

I have modified certain exercises to accommodate my special needs, but I don't think those modifications compromised the results enough to worry about.

By the way, I am seriously overweight and am a senior citizen. If I can do this program, so can a lot of other people who might think otherwise. Try it for a week or two....you might be amazed too.
