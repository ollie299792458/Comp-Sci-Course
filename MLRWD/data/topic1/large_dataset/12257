OK - hokey title but THE NAKED PREY says it all.  I became aware of this film in the mid-70's and then only because it entered the realm of cable movies.  I had been aware of Wilde for some time, primarily for THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH but this film is clearly a labor of love.  Wilde with a sparing use of words conveys everything "The Man" (as his character is billed) is thinking in this film.  The film is rather predictable to begin with - white hunters dissrespect the natives and pay the price but when the hunters and baearers are dispatched in very imaginative fashions, this leaves only "The Man" to fend for himself.  At first it seems like "no contest" when Wilde is stripped of weapons and clothes and given a slight head start to outrun the village's best warriors; however, Wilde's character shows a resourcefulness borne of spending years in the bush.  There is basically no dialog after the chase begins and none is needed.  The payoff at the end is worth the "ride".

Wilde also directed BEACH RED which was an unflinching look at Pacific combat in WWII, but THE NAKED PREY remains my favorite.  It was only after seeing Mel Gibson's APOCOLYPTO that I appreciated Wilde's film even more since the second half of Gibson's film is basically THE NAKED PREY.  There are a few "things" that show this film was not a multi-million dollar production - specifically look for a white van crossing behind Wilde while he was in the "bush" - but for raw, effective story telling, this film can't be beat.  You really feel like you've endured almost as much as "The Man" has just by watching this film.  The fact that Wilde was in such great shape for a man in his fifties when he made this film shows his committment for realism.

And believe me, you'll never look at a clay pot the same way again.......
