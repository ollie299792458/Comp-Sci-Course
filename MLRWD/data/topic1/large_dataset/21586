Positives:

1.  Several workout options, able to put together your own routine in whatever order you choose.

2.  Upbeat instructors (w/o being annoying)

3.  Shape meal plan that came with mine has Yummy recipes!

Negatives:

1.  TERRIBLE MUSIC!!  I prefer upbeat tempo; the music on this DVD is barely audible and is....well...weird!  Sounds like something a kid could play on a keyboard.

2.  The routines within each section quickly become boring.  In my opinion each individual set is repeated too often.  =monotonous

3.  Too many steps to play a single workout session.  For example, first you must go to the main menu and choose the warm-up.  Then back to the main menu to select your routines, in the order you wish to do them.  Then back to the main menu to select the cool-down.  You are unable to select the warm up or cool down as a seamless piece of your workout.

4.  The DVD repeats a "tip" before/after each workout routine option...and it gets annoying to hear these tips EVERY time you do one of the sections.  It would have been nice instead for them to include such tips elsewhere.
