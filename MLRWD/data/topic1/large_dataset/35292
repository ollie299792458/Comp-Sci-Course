Brought this because I was hoping it would fit in well with the original to give my grandchildren more of a good thing.  The video does not disappoint.  The few inconsistencies such as the number of Thumper's sisters does not distract.  The relationship between Bambi and the Old Prince of the Forest is uplifting as a father takes over the responsibility for his motherless child.  Showing there is no immediate hesitation but second thoughts while the father thinks he is not really fit for this responsibility and then comes to realize it is not a responsibility he wants to give up.  So it has a nice little morality tale embedded.  The inconsistency that did get to me a bit, but would probably be missed by young children is the Prince's revelation he first met Bambi's mother when he was young.  This doesn't fit the description Bambi's mother gives of deer respecting him due to his old age unless we conclude Bambi's mother was an old doe.  Sweet and enjoyable story with cartooning that melds well with the original classic.
