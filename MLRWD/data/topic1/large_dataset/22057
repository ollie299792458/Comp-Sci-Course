It's official. I now like Martin Scorsese's documentaries more than his dramatic films.  I smiled through all four hours of this movie in which the quiet Beatle is not so quiet, nor are those close to him quiet about him. We really get a good look here at a man who made the most of what the world gave him, and who was quite aware of what it all meant in close to real time.  That is rare. Most of us, myself included, figure out why we did what we did a bit later, looking back, sorting through it all.

And, without coming out and saying it, the film illuminates why the East-meets-West spiritual path Harrison walked (and pioneered) was such a perfect fit and a success for him, while others, famous and not-so-famous, only managed to annoy those around them with similar inner journeyings. The reason TM and mantras and Krishna-consciousness worked for Harrison is that they were not empty exercises in "self-actualization".  He also walked the walk in the materiel world, as demonstrated by his deep love, devotion, and service to others--and his love of life.
