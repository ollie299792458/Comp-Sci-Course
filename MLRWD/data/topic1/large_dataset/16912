Disney's been dabbling in the magic of CGI ... and for our family, at least, the magic worked.  We often all laughed out loud at the same places (2 adults, a 6-year-old and a 3 1/2-year-old), and the adults chorused, "Wow", when the CGI effects were especially impressive (e.g. the popcorn scene.)

This movie's similar in theme and style to the earlier "Once Upon a Christmas", which my kids still thorougly enjoy and continue to watch, even with the new one.  But the computer-generated animation of "Twice" gives an almost 3D effect which, pardon the expression, adds a new dimension to the story ... more texture to the experience; like good special effects in an action movie or subtle highlights in a silk garment.

Who knows if hand-drawn cartoons will still be made 50 years from now?  For that matter, who knows how old-fashioned our current CGI will appear then?  What I DO know is that our family STILL enjoys the ones drawn 50 years (and more) ago ... and that each decade of animation has its own slightly different style and its own unique appeal.  So I won't fret that CGI will destroy the beautiful old-fashioned style of animation; it's just another dish to add to the smorgasbord of family entertainment.

Congratulations on a great addition to family holiday traditions, Disney.
