I had only two problems with the movie---
(1) Why didn't they just make the kid 13 (his real age) or at least 12-- it was very difficult to believe he was just 11 as the story puts it-- at least not here in the U.S.  ??
(2) In real life, Northeastern England, mid-1980s... could people not even say "Pass the butter" without saying, "Pass the
----ing butter!"  ??  I fully accept that kids use 4-letter words until they wear them out or get bored with them, but wasn't this just a tad overdone in "Billy"-- especially for the adults???
I think what struck me most was the *reminders* of elements in other movies-- for example:
*Kid yells at parent to stop beating sibling. ("A Home of Our Own")
*One last lingering look at the old homeplace. ("Grapes of Wrath")
*Father finally accepting his son being different. ("October Sky")
*The eternal struggle of labor against big business. ("How Green Was My Valley")
*One boy accepting the *affections* of another, even
  though he really doesn't understand them. ("This Boy's Life")
*Boy being sent out into the world (by his ballet teacher) to
learn about life. ("Pelle the Conqueror")
If you have watched "Billy", I am sure you can think of other examples.
I LOVED the accents, but had to watch the movie a second time with captions for the deaf enabled-- to know what the heck they were saying in many spots.
I wish I knew what kind of success this movie had here in Texas-- my guess is that our pistol-packin',  football hero dads would say, "Well, okay for him I guess-- just don't let it ever happen to MY boy!"
Interesting that they auditioned 2,000 kids (and almost gave up) before they found a kid who could act AND dance.  Jamie Bell was fantastic as Billy.
Many very touching moments in the film-- the boy trying to clean the spray paint from his mom's grave marker;  the grandmother being left behind;  the father willing to be a *scab* to earn money for his son's trip;  the miners having to go back to a job at the same or even less salary (been there, done that, bought the t-shirt-- it is a lousy feeling!)  Those are just a few examples.
The extra DVD material was very interesting and helpful! This one richly deserved all the praise it received--
