I had not seen this film since it first came out - and now I know why I had forgotten all about it.

The great, and even average, screwball comedies have an internal consistency and characters we believe live in their odd little worlds.  Unfortunately, "What's Up Doc?" misses on almost all fronts.  While a fan of Buck Henry and Peter Bogdanovich, I have a hard time equating the poor pacing and mediocrity of this forced comedy with such artists.  If nothing else, there are way too many written gems thrown away due to poor timing - and whether Bogdanovich couldn't get the performances he wanted or he intended to rush comic line deliveries, I don't know.

Madeleine Kahn is the true jewel in this not so madcap piece.  "Eunice" is complete and a joy because of it.  Few of the other characters rise to the same level of 100% believable pure comic characterization.  Ryan O'Neal zips through almost all his comic beats and Barbara Streisand is so busy "being funny", she isn't funny at all. O'Neal and Streisand give us performances while Kahn IS Eunice.  So sad we lost her as early as we did.

With a supporting cast including the likes of Kenneth Mars and Austin Pendleton, I expected much more.  Good comedy finds its own energy and carries us along while we easily forgive any flaws and give in to the willing suspension of disbelief.  From the outset, there are too many story holes, pushed performances, and pacing inconsistencies for even me to suspend that much.
