This actually a very scary, funny, and poorly made movie all at the same time, but manages to be good. We are introduced once again to Jason, but this time he's all grown up now, and can do things for himself. The costume for Jason in this film, is actually creepy. To get scareed in this film you must take it seriously, and not make fun of it (that's what Scream is for) and enjoy this as a horror movie. This series is always being bashed by critics, but the fact of the matter is, Friday the 13th does have a plot and tells a long complex story, it's about a boy who drowned, but comes back to life to take revenge for his dead mother. He was a mongoloid and wasn't liked by the counselers or the kids, and was a mager hydrophobic. The only friend he had in the world was his mother, and when he saw her die, he went insane, and decided that if anyone ventured into the woods again, he'd kill them. This series is terribly misunderstood, and should be taken seriously, regardless how poorly they were made. Paramount better start releasing these movies un-cut, because idf they haven't relized, there are more people that like it than those who dont. It takes a certain breed of woman to face off against Jason Voorhees - delicate and sensitive, slightly on the prim side but resourceful when it comes to a life-or-death battle. Women should praise these films, because it is the women who are the heros and not the men. I don't think anybody really set out to change the world with these movies, nobody will ever be accused of trying to make a social statement or great art. What these films are is entertainment, and about what the audience wants. Can't wait for Freddy v.s. Jason, Jason is going to win!
