Rounders, a positively captivating movie, has no need for previous knowledge of poker to completely enjoy. Speaking as a person who finds it almost impossible to watch The World Series of Poker, I found Rounders to be truly intriguing.

Matt Damon's superb acting draws excitement, and brings forth a natural love for his character, Mike. On the flip side Edward Norton's character, Worm, only brings out a distinct annoyance for his choices, and ultimately him.

All sides of gambling are shown in Rounders, the high points of winning, and the lowest moments, when its not just money involved.  The constant risk and intensity of it all keeps viewers on edge throughout the entire movie.

No matter how hard Mike fights, he can't bring himself to leave gambling behind to start a new path toward law school.  Along with a lesson on gambling, Rounders also offers a lesson in life; sometimes no matter how hard we try to change, our lives are destined one way or another.

Rounders was well thought out, and very entertaining. Whether you're a gambler or know nothing of the game, you wont be disappointed.
