That lady friend of david the lawyer is OFF THE HOOK. But seriously folks, Boomtown is quite possibly the greatest crime drama ever released. It's put together amazingly in probably the most original format i've ever seen, the story lines grab you by the balls and don't let go, and it's all brought together by an amazing cast. Guy with severe underbite from forest gump, lady from minority report, and especially everyones favorite new kid ont he block, donnie wahlberg. They all bring a perfect touch of drama to this nearly perfect television show.
It would be a shame if this isn't released to the US on DVD. Season one of Boomtown truely was a masterpeice. A wiseman once said, "The fire you kindle for your enemy often burns yourself more than him." I don't know what this means, but i do know one thing...Boomtown was pure gold. We need to support Boomtown, if we all enter our e-mail addresses at the top of the page and vote, boomtown will rise from the ashes and become imortalized in the form of DVD. Thank you for your time, and don't forget to watch 24 tuesdays at 9pm.
