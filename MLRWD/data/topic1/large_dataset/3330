When this first came out I was a little skeptic about another "Journey", I enjoyed Journey to the Center of the Earth, but really didn't think another movie with a 1 original character (from he first movie) was going to be that great. I was wrong; overall Journey 2 provided an adventure, comedy that spoke of the importance of families.  I was pleased with how they integrated the same concepts from the Journey to the Center of the Earth into Journey 2.  As for the actual movie transfer to DVD, Bluray and 3d, I was pleased.  The DVD offers and normal standard definition with 5.1 surround movie.  In contrast however both the Blu-ray and 3D versions, are brighter, more clear and crisp in High Definition.

In comparison of the 3 versions.  The blu-ray offers a nice digital transfer and a high resolution.  However, the 3d version provides the most entertainment, as this movie was shot using 3d filming methods, not converted in post processing.  This movie goes beyond just 3D and, whether it is insects, birds, water, or shrapnel, the movie provides "pop out of the screen" moments that surprise you, and further the experience that most current 3D movies fail to provide.

Please Note:
I do not normally suggest 3D for everyone because most movies are just 3D, a movie with extra depth, that can stand alone in 2D format.  Journey 2, however is the exceptions, In my opinion 3D is a must.
