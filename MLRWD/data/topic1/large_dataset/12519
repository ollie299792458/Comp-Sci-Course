Looked great, was exciting and original, and was one of the most visually imaginative movies I have ever seen.  With this and Out of Sight under his belt (and the Coens' "Brother Where Art Thou" and Wolfgang  Peterson's "Perfect Storm" on the way) George Cloony could turn  out to be a really great cool actor, and Mark Wahlberg proves once again  (see Boogie Nights) that he is more than just a singer who drops his pants.  Ice Cube and Spike Jonze were great as well, I might add.  The best part  about this movie is that it doesn't abandon intelligence like most action  movies do these days, and preserves a strong political viewpoint  throughout.  The footage of the bullet entering the body was unlike  anything ive seen used in film, and the gunfight scene in the villaige was  great.  I think the most important part of the movie however was the long  running scene in the bunker between the imprisoned Wahlberg and his captor,  who lost his wife and child in one of the US's air strikes.  It shows that  both sides have something to lose, and offers the fact that the US can't  always be seen as the only side fighting for a richeous cause in a war.  By  the way: I am not one who likes to pass judgement on other peoples' movie  opinions, but I must say that anybody who gives Ace Ventura precedence over  this masterwork has more than a few screws loose.  I can't wait for the  DVD.
