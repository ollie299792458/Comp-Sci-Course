I just watched this film and to response to the negative reviews:

1.  For me the plot was not thin at all.  Sure I knew the characters were going  to get together, but so what?  I found myself rooting for them and knew the secret would be revealed at the right time.
2.  This film did not need a bigger budget.  It was intimate, warm, and the camera work and cinimatography splendid.
3.  The acting was excellent.  The two leads were totally believable and I felt the characters bond from the very beginning of the film.
4.  I did not feel there were too many weepy moments.  These were pretty strong themes and emotions the characters were going through, and I felt their pain and joy.
5.  I do have to agree about one point.  I was sure after the confession they would be making love in front of the fireplace. But they just held on to each other devulging more sweet sentiment.  That is still alright with me.

As far as gay themed love story films, I have to rate this one up there with Shelter, Beautiful Thing, and Big Eden.  It made me feel good.  Their was not one gay stereotype in the whole film.  For that I give it 5 stars alone.  It was about real people in real situations.  Highly recommended.
