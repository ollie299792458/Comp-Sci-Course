If, like me, you own the vhs and laser disc versions of this spectacular concert from one of the world's best rock bands then prepared to be dazzled by the 5.1 audio mix of this DVD. You have the option of selecting audio formats Dolby Digital or DTS on this disc which is always a plus. To hear the  classic INXS singles like Need you tonight, Suicide Blonde, and What you need in 5.1 is truly a delight for the ears. From the counting off of the songs right down to the backing vocals from INXS members Jon Farriss, Andrew Farriss and Kirk Pengilly. You can hear all of it so much clearer. Reviewers note:If you don't have a home theater set up equipped with at least 5.1 processing then none of what I just said regarding the audio mix will matter. The print on the DVD release of Live Baby Live is also considerably better than that of the grainy laser disc. The fun doesn't stop after the 100 minute concert either. This disc is loaded with extras! Band commentary, a photo gallery, behind the scenes footage and more make this a solid must own DVD for any INXS fan.
