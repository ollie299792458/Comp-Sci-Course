Actually, this is one of those great films which can be enjoyed on several different levels:

1- HORROR FILM. Talking head, Elisha Cook, with his spook talk, messes with the minds of youngsters watching this movie.

2- MURDER MYSTERY. Many women enjoy this film as a murder mystery.

3- BLACK COMEDY. Those with a sense of humor (mostly men) enjoy the humor. Vincent Price, with this sly and sardonic sense of humor, will crack you up.

The color is wonderful and similar to technicolor existent at the time. I've always wondered how colorizers choose which colors to use. On the HoHH poster, Price sports a brown suit; here his suit is navy and Alan Marshal sports the brown suit. Hmmm...according to the author of the book, DRESS FOR SUCCESS, brown is the most negative suit color in the public's mind. The acid is lime green, Annabelle's evening gown (which she wears only briefly) is red, and Ruth Bridger's outfit is emerald. Clever color choices. Are colorizers truly able to determine the original colors or is color selection capricious?

Several interesting facts:

1. Vincent Price was not paid a salary for his role but was given a share of the movie's profits--and the film cleaned up. In fact, Alfred Hitchcock noticed the money it made and decided to turn to a black and white shocker for his next film, PSYCHO.

2. The house was designed by famed architect, Frank Lloyd Wright, and is in Hollywood Hills. The house was built in the 1920s and was not a hundred years old, as Elisa Cook states at the beginning of the film.

It would have been interesting to have had some behind-the-scene shots during the making of the movie. I've seen several over the years. Nevertheless, this is a modestly-priced item which will give you countless hours of enjoyment.
