I saw this in the theatre when it first came out and have always tuned in on it whenever I discovered it channel-surfing. It's a great, gritty western that puts you out there in the wilderness, but without using all the sprawling, gratuitous scenery shots you find in so many other films. The story avoids ending up as just a typical revenge tale for many reasons; the variety of characters met along the way, the period of the story - the end of a long Civil War, which left its devastation in the human soul as well as the towns and lands, the ongoing Native American tragedy and the Western Expansion. One can almost get side-tracked from the main plot line except that it all comes together at the end, as the friendships that have been established and the hard experiences that have bonded them culminate in a tense bar room scene that is a brilliant display of unspoken communication between both life-long friends and bitter enemies at the same time. Clint Eastwood pays his audience a great service by letting them in on the secret and you're holding your breath right there with him. Character development, something so ignored in films all too much in favor of explosions and special effects, really makes this piece shine.
