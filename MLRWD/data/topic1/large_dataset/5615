When I first saw this movie, I actually cried, laughing so hard!  When Jonah is in the belly of the whale, Some vegetable angels come and talk to him, there.  Their hairstyles and dress remind you of the more richly pigmented members of this society, and when they start singing, they look and sound for all the world like a black church choir.  That one scene is the one I always think of from this movie.  When my son watches the video, I will often come in and watch it during that scene.  I absolutely LOVE it!
I think they captured the personality of the Biblical Jonah fairly well with Archibald playing the lead.  While they tell the Biblical story of Jonah, they dress it up with aspects of the Veggie Tales assortment of characters that make it quite entertaining.  The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything actually do, in this video -- they are participants in the story!
The best things about VeggieTales are all there, only moreso in this movie length presentation.  The jokes for the parents are there in full force, so we adults can enjoy it along with our children.  I recommend it highly.
