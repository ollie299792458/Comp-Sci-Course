Phantom Of The Paradise is perhaps one of the most unusual and intriguing films i've ever come to know. it is one the most creative spectacles of Brian DePalma's lengthy career, and may very well be his best film to date. on the surface, it is a send-up of Glam Rock, Faust, and Phantom Of The Opera. in reality, it is a film about getting revenge on those who have hurt us, as shown in the dynamic story of the nerdy and disgruntled composer Winslow Leach (whose Phantom outfit and make-up could easily have been the predecessor to the Goth Rock era of the 80's) wreaking havoc on the devilish (and that terms comes in quite handy here) record tycoon Swan for stealing Leach's 'Faust' cantata and basically destroying Leach's life (and appearance). talk about persistance: Leach will stop at nothing to terrorize Swan, and even dabbles in arson (blowing up the set design during one of the 'Faust' rehearsals) and murder (electrocuting over-the-top singer Beef mid-performance)to get his point across: one should never f**k with a 'somewhat' dead man's music. and i prove my point by concluding that Phantom Of The Paradise is a wonder to behold.
