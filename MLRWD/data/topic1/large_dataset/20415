The Count of Monte Cristo is among the all-time great works of adventure fiction. It is shot through with intrigue, both political and romantic, gripping suspense, and slam-bang action. The first time I read it I lost a few nights' sleep because I couldn't stop reading to turn off the lights. The best way by far to appreciate a story of this breadth and texture is to read the book. If you must watch a screen version, however, this is the one.

This production, with a cast of impressive depth and range, surpasses the other film versions I've seen. The book is sprawling, and any screen adaptation necessarily makes substantial cuts, omitting and reconnecting various plot lines. Here, the character of Mondego (played by Jean Rochefort--one of France's great actors, but miscast in a part that calls for a younger and darker man to play against the smoldering rage of Edmond Dantes) is somewhat underdeveloped.

On balance, though, this production succeeds impressively. The dialogue, most of the time, is worthy of Dumas. The English subtitles are excellent as well (accurate and colloquial without being overly intrusive).

A superb entertainment.
