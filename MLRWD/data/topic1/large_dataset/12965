Okay guys here's the deal,
I am ( unfortunately ?) old enough to remember what this film looked like during its original theatrical release. It didn't look that much better than this Blu-Ray.
I have always loved this period-perfect nostalgia piece & having experienced this era for myself I can attest to its general veracity. I have seen a number of reviews critical of this transfer, but having owned the VHS & DVD versions rest assured that American Graffiti has never looked better. Yes there is slight edge-enhancement if you really look for it & a bit of Black Crush in the darkest scenes & occasional depth-of-field limitations here & there,but the majority,I'm convinced, is due to source limitations.
I suppose that a hurculean effort by an entity like Criterion might be able to improve on this transfer,but only marginally.
If you love this little gem of a movie like I do, you can buy this with the confidence that it is about as good as this movie is ever likely to look & sound.
