Vulgar is the perfect name for this tirade into treachery. With such a great cast, it's hard to believe this movie is so weak. Will Carlson, (Brian O'Halloran, Clerks) a children's party clown who goes by the name of Flappy, attempts to make some extra cash by posting an ad in adult personals as Vulgar the Clown. After an ugly incident with a customer Will buries his alter ego, and inadvertently becomes a hero. Soon however, his past comes back to haunt him. The original plot of this movie is great, but there are plenty of problems. Most of the dialogue is fluff, and the shots are either too dark or overly clean. The camera moves too much in many scenes. It's almost like writer/director Bryan Johnson (Steve-Dave from Mallrats fame) didn't know what kind of movie he was making. There are snippets of comedy with overtones of rape and murder. The highlights to this movie are reserved for fans of other View Askew productions. There are many recognizable cameos from View Askew stars. From Clerks/Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back writer/director/star Kevin Smith, (who also co-produced this movie) for the first time not as Silent Bob, but as a homosexual television producer, to Jay himself Jason Mewes, as a gun fencing druggie. If you like View Askew movies (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) Vulgar is a must see. Just seeing so many familiar faces will give you a warm feeling inside, even though the movie will nauseate you. If you don't know of the Viewaskewniverse, do your self a favor and stay away until you get to know it. P.S. DO NOT USE THIS MOVIE TO INTRODUCE YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO VIEW ASKEW! YOU WONT WIN KEVIN SMITH ANY NEW FANS AND YOU MAY LOSE A FEW FRIENDS.
