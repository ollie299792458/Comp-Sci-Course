I have been taking beginners pilates classes for several months now, so I am by no means an expert, but what I can tell you is that my very first class involved much more depth than this "Quick and Dirty Guide"! I worked through all of the guided exercises once, as soon as I received this DVD by post, and it built up my excitement - when, I wondered, would the extensive warm-ups be over so that I could REALLY see what this DVD had to offer? Sadly, the end of what I had thought to be "warm-ups" coincided with the end of the DVD.

This workout is more similar to the yoga classes I've taken than Pilates, which generally involves some difficult work in my experience. Instead, what you will find on the Quick and Dirty Guide is more of a slow moving, flowing, and very gentle series of progressive movements. Basically you will get to stretch your legs out a bit, and warm up your shoulders and arms, and then the workout is over.

I now realize that this is only Part 1 to what I assume will be a several part series. I am quite disappointed in this DVD, but I suppose I can use it as a warmup to my usual workout.
