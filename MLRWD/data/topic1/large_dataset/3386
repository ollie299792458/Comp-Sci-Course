The movie itself deserve 5 stars.  The features deserve 0!!!

Whoever said this DVD has tons of them really doesn't get out much. But, if you like hearing about the director and how innovative he is and how he brought the movie to life, and all that self abasing stuff, well then yeah, this DVD is full of them!!  I didn't realize how stuck on himself the Tarantino is.  He has a bunch of the actors talking about how great a director he is and how he approached the making of the movie, but I came away with the same questions about the movie as I did when I watched the Special Features.  The deleted scenes, were so-so.  What I hoped to learn about the movie was his concept in detail.  Sure he goes over it, but really goes back to talking about himself.  I wanted to learn about the briefcase and what it represented, and learn about each of the characters themselves not the director!!!

Well, I'm not really big on "Special Features" so I could care less, but for those who are going to buy this just for the special features, well, you'll be disappointed.  Just buy a autobiography about Qentin Tarantino, I'm sure one exists and if not, I'm sure he'll put one out.
