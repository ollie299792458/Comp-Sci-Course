I think the strength of this film lies in its cross between a crime thriller and an arthouse-style love story. The pace is slow, but still flows along smoothly and doesn't drag down the sense of action. Heaven opens in a very modern, technological setting of helicopters, bombs, drugs and terrorists, yet manages to close perfectly at the end with a sense of 'a state of grace' that should not usually be found in an action flick. It's a perfect transition from thriller to something more than a love story.
Cate Blanchett and Giovanni Ribisi are outstanding in their acting. In looks and small gestures, they subtly convey the entire sense of their characters. The camera work is fantastic too, the most memorable scene being the one where the camera pans 360 degrees around the tree on Philippa's friend's farm, night turning to day turning to dusk again as the Philippa and Filippo wander underneath. The accompanying music score, though minimalistic and simple, suits the atmosphere perfectly with the strains of violin and piano chords. 
The only lamentable flaw is in the film is that there is no resolution to Philippa's pain at having caused the death of 4 innocents. Early on she tells Filippo that she agreed to escape not because she wanted to escape punishment, and later she says she will never be able to live with what she has done. These seem to indicate that some form of 'punishment' is in order, but at the end of the film nothing more is said about that and we have to assume she has decided she can very well live happily ever after with Filippo, neglecting her guilt at having killed innocents in her quest for justice. Since the impact of the film is based Phillipa's moral decision to take justice into her own hands and the terrible consequences, it is an unforgivable oversight to so blithely ignore her guilt -even if she never intended for the bombing to go awry- in favour of love, no matter how beautiful or touching that love is.
