I've read many reviews, with most being off or not thought out. Insurrection was a really good installment, it just had a hard act to follow. For those who say it was a giant tv episode, it can't hold a candle in that department compared to Generations. 
What gets me is people complaining about too strong of a humorous element. Star Trek has always held some humor in it. From Bones and Spock arguing, to Data's misunderstandings, Quark in general, the Doctor and Neelix, humor has always been a strong element. Besides, this isn't even the funniest movie in the series. Everybody remember The Voyage Home? Kirk and Spock trying to get around in 1985, along with Chekov just being Chekov, made #4 a lot funnier. 
There are some holes in the plot, but not as many as you'd think. Like, why was Data on that planet in the first place? And what was so special that Worf took a vacation and happened to on board. Besides a few others, this movie was very good, albeit not quite as good as First Contact. Fear not though, I guess that they are going all out in Star Trek X: Nemesis.
