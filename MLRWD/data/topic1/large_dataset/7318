Dismal, just dismal.  Why did Guy Pearce, who is usually pretty careful about which movies he signs up for, take on this disaster?  Must have been the lure of a good payday, or the opportunity to run and jump around as a modern action hero.

They should be required to say it's INSPIRED by the HG Wells novel, since they chenge so much of the plot, completely jettisoning any of the social critique that was in the book and the 1960 classic. And even that might be okay, if they didn't decide to jazz it up with all kinds of digital special effects.  I looked forward to seeing this, but it had no soul, just empty action/adventure.

But, what about that blond girl in 2030 NYC with the bicycle, who talks to Pearce when he stops the machine for the first time?  I actually thought that might develop into some kind of sub-plot, and after sitting through this whole travesty, I kind of wish it had.

Stick with the 1960 version.  It may not have that modern sheen, but it has soul and intelligence.
