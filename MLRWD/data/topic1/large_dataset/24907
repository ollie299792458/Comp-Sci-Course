Greta wants to kill herself, Greta gets shipped off to her Grandparents, and Greta spends the summer discovering who she is and why life may be worth living. Not the most original script, but let's face it, most movies end just the way you thought they would and take the path you thought they would take. In `According to Greta' it is mostly about watching the journey. We see into Greta's inner thoughts through diary sequences, a clever montage of doodles, clip art and frantic scribbles. I have to admit, it was one of the most interesting, and perhaps the only original, thing about the show.

Evan Ross shines on-screen, turning in a wonderfully understated performance, in contrast with Hillary Duff's performance, which seems just a little too desperate. (We get it, you aren't Lizzy McGuire anymore.) I think Duff does a respectable job in the role; the character is just a little much. She's smart, she's bored, and she's clever. So, just be smart, bored and clever. Don't take every opportunity to tell us how smart, bored and clever her character is.

Overall, this is a good movie. I enjoyed watching it, even if I doubt I'll ever watch it a second time.
