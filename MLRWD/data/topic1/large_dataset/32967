This is definitely a wonderful movie for audiences of all ages! Although some viewers may find it ultra cheesy and predictable, the outstanding performances (especially by Palmer and the other young actors) overshadow and outshine the underlying clich&eacute;s and mushiness. All of the characterizations are thoughtful and realistic, and Akeelah is particularly admirable and loveable. Although the themes of perseverance, courage, determination, and friendship are not necessarily unique, they blend together bee-utifully to create a film far more worthwhile than any of the ridiculous big budget blockbusters playing on neighboring screens. L.A. moviegoers may be particularly amused and entertained by all of the local footage and references, as Akeelah journeys from Crenshaw to Woodland Hills, Beverly Hills, and USC in her quest for spelling domination. Her spelling coach is portrayed as a UCLA professor (Go Bruins!), and even Channel 13's Lauren Sanchez makes a cameo as she reports on Akeelah's progress. Overall, Akeelah and the Bee provides a simple but refreshing 2-hour escape!
