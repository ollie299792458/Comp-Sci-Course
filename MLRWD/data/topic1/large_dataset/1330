The movie 2010 holds a special place in my heart, and it's a special film for my wife and I. For many years I've been frustrated by the fact that the only available copy of this film on DVD is an old, non-anamorphic transfer. 2.35:1 letterboxing on non-anamorphic makes for terrible picture quality and resolution.

When I saw that a Blu-ray transfer was being released, I was very excited. I read many of the reviews here on Amazon, and I got the information I was looking for: this is a real 35mm to Blu-ray transfer, with the aspect ratio intact.

What do I mean by "no-frills"? No attempt was made to clean up the film grain or punch up the color for this transfer. The limitations of the source material are clearly evident, and many artifacts of the special effects are much more visible. The film does look much better on Blu-ray than the DVD ever did, however.

Overall I got what I wanted out of this disc: a watchable version of one of my favorite films with the aspect ratio correctly preserved. For $11, well worth the money.
