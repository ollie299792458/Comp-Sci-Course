King of Kings is a very enjoyable film about Jesus' life which is mostly accurate to the Bible.  Jeffrey Hunter, who plays Jesus, is just right for the intelligence and sensitivity of the role, and the character of Jesus is shown with great reverence. Star Trek fans will remember Hunter as Captain Christoper Pike in "The Cage". The character of Barabbas is emphasized more in this film than in the Bible, and the actress playing Herod's daughter is memorable, though that character is also briefly mentioned in Scripture.  It's not a film with a high budget, but the scenes are tastefully done with beautiful sets which look much like the Bible times they portray, and the wardrobe is quite authentic too. The film was made in wide screen (like Ben Hur but on a much lower budget), which adds something to the visual appeal. This DVD is of good quality with fine sound and picture, although there is little bonus material except for a trailer and some advertising.  However, King of Kings is definitely worth adding to your collection if you love religious films. It can be enjoyed just as much at other times of the year (not just Christmas and Easter) if you want a thoughtful, moving film experience.
