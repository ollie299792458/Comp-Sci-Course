The Western is alive and well!

Shreck2 was all rented out last night, so I grabbed the first thing that looked half-way interesting, and I am glad I did.  In my opinion "Open Range" with Kevin Costner, Robert Duvall and Annette Bening is an unexpected masterpiece - Costner's best best directorial effort by far - and perhaps one of the greatest Westerns ever made.  It belongs right up there with Shane and Unforgiven.

The plot is actually fairly predictable, and has been done many times before: classic good guy/bad guy hero/quest mythos straight out of Joseph Cambell. But here it is done simply superlatively.  The acting, editing, scenery, character development and pacing are also exceptional, but the characteristic that stands above all else is the utter realism and the fanatical, obsessive attention to detail.

Some examples:

- Looking out onto the street of the frontier town through a window, you see the scene through the fly-specked waviness of poor quality cheap glass.

- The heroine looks like a frontier woman - the worry and toil lines in the face, the plain dress, the lack of Hollywood makeup.  She is, nevertheless, very attractive - attractive simply because she is REAL and not a Hollywood Clone.  We care about her as a person.

- The mud, the dirt, and the rain:  Lots of it, and realistic as all getout. And the people exposed to it look as miserable and p***ed off as they would in real life.

- The reaction of the townsfolk to the coming gunfight:  Gee, what do you do when faced with two enraged cowpokes who have locked up the corrupt, bought-and-paid-for Marshall and several henchmen of the villian and are wandering around town, armed to the teeth, looking for the best strategic/tactical location to have a showdown with the numerical superior bad guys? In the real world you leave town, which is what most of the townsfolk do, hightailing it en-masse for the church on the outskirts of town.

- The gunfight:  as another reviewer on the Amazon site pointed out, the gunfight is utterly realistic: short, extremely violent, and chaotic.  We are used to seeing Hollywood gunfights where the person shot slowly sinks to the ground with various facial expressions.  Here, though, is the real world action of:

  - Most shots are totally ineffective, either missing completely or  grazing. In the real world it is extraordinarily hard to hit a man when both you and he are moving, ducking, weaving and dodging.

  - Reloading: your hands are jerking and shaking and fumbling and dropping bullets and almost your gun because you are scared out of your wits and you are having an adrenilin rush.

  - A man who is gut shot by a 12 guage shotgun at close range being thrown across the street to crash into a wall like a rag doll

(This last was very interesting, as the one note of gunfight UNrealism -- shared with virtually every single film I've every seen -- are the scenes where someone gets shot in the chest or stomach - or even leg - with a 45 cal bullet and is NOT out of commission for days if not weeks. It just doesn't happen that damage of that kind can be even partially recuperated from in 24 or 48 hours. But this bit of Hollywood magic is a plot-driven given in the world of film, and I doubt that any movie could successfully challenge it.)

I highly recommend this film, with a 9-1/2 out of 10 rating.  It is one I intend to add to my personal collection.
