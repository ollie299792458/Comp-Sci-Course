Watched "Ong-Bak" and enjoyed the innocence, character comedy and Jaa's Muay Thai fighting.  Though cheesy and low budget - feeling at times, Ong-Bak was far superior to this movie in every way (except, perhaps the budget).  Raw powered Muay Thai moves vs. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot sceenes wit no real continuity.

Seriously - the "witch" in the cave and in the end of the movie?  If that made it through the cutting room and into the film, can you imagine what gems were left out?  Ting eating breakfast and having a adversary jump out of his Cheerios?  Ting visiting the latrine and being paid a visit by the Turd-King?  Ting tripping over his feet and getting into a fight with the ground?  That's too bad, because those kinds of scenes would make about as much sense as what I just watched.

This is not a personal attack against Tony Jaa - though I think the result is much of his fault.  I think (by watching the credits) he spread himself too thin.  How can you expect a movie to turn out great if you see this kind of stuff in the credits:

Starring: Tony Jaa

Story by: Tony Jaa

Directed by: Tona Jaa

Choreography: Tony Jaa

Martial Arts Director:  Tony Jaa

Craft Service:  Tony Jaa

Elephant Trainer:  Tony Jaa...

...you get the idea.  Out of ambition or necessity, Jaa didn't spend enough time on any one job in this film and came out as a "Jack of all trades, master of none".  The film suffered and so did we.
