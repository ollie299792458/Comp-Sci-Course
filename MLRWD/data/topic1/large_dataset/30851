Pardon the pun. How else do you describe an incredible, fun, loving movie of two sisters who can't seem to help getting into trouble? Exactly. Enchanting.
The movie begins with two doting aunts telling their orphaned neices the story of their heritige. It was a curse that "any man who dared love an Ownes woman was doomed to die." And it happened.
The neices are Gillian and Sally Owens, two sisters who are, well, witches, like their aunts. Their aunts take them in, and give them choclate for breakfast, no brushing teeth or hair, and teach them magic.
Well, it's not long before Gillian runs away, and Sally gets married. Then, Sally's husband dies, leaving her with two little girls-Kylie and Antonia. And Gillian gets into trouble...big trouble with a boyfriend.
Suddenly, with a whirlwind of magic and mistakes, they have a ghost, a possession, two angry aunts, a cop, and, oh yeah, a Phone Tree day.
This movie is a wonderful blend of fantasy, magic, and love.
This contains many good quotes, such as:
Gillian: Have you ever spread your arms up and spun around really really fast? Well, that's what love is like.
Sally: Since when is being a slut a crime in this family?
Now, I'm going to go read the book and leave you with the words of Aunt Jet:
"There's a little witch in all of us."
