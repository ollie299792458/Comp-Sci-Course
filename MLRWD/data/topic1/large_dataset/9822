As an adult, I would say that it was just a dumb movie.  Oddly enough, I thought Johnny Knoxville was interesting and they did play parts of my favorite AC/DC song (what is an AC/DC song doing in a movie like this?!?).  I also like breastesses.  Seann Wm Scott is from the K.Costner school of acting.  He plays the same character (Stiffler) in every role.  The movie barely resembles the series in any way, except for the car.  Ogling J. Simpson is fun but watching her act hurts.  To think that after enduring this we watched "The Island".  Sad.  Many good brain cells were killed that night.  Thank God for alcohol.  A true twin bill of terror.

As the parent of an 8 year old who has "discovered" the original series, I was appalled.  Let's face it - there are plenty of crappy movies to go around.  I have no problem with that.  But many movies are going to appeal to kids, and this is one such movie.  Other TV shows - The Beverly Hillbillies, Scooby Doo, Addams Family have been redone in such a way that they can be enjoyed relatively safely by families.

I recognize that this is the "Unrated" version, but that was all there was to rent.  I didn't get a choice.  I suspect that the "regular" version wasn't much better.  It is hard to believe that the great minds of Hwood could have dumbed down what was already one of the lowest common denominator shows of the last 25 years.  Amazing.  The profanily and sexual content took it to a new level.
