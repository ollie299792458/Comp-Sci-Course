What a fantastic film! As dark as it may be, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Reese Witherspoon, Ryan Phillipe (hottie!), and Selma Blair are phenomenal in this twisted...well, I'm not sure what you'd call it. It's pretty funny in the beginning, but gets thrilling in the end.
The only bad thing about this movie would have to be it's ending. First a crucial character is...erm...well something bad happens to them, and then Sebastian gets revenge on Catherine. Then it just ends. I mean, you never see what happened to Catherine or Annette! You find out what happens to Sebastian, but not to the two (or three, if you include Ceccile (Selma Blair) female characters.
Just don't let young children see this movie, because I think that it gives a message saying "Doing it is okay, it's all fun and games." Although the two evil characters do get revenge in the end.
An added bonus of this movie would be a scene in which you see Ryan Phillipe's butt.
Phillipe and Witherspoon have fantastic chemistry together, which would make sense seeing as they are now married and are expecting their second child. But everyone plays their characters well. Catherine is pure evil, Sebastian is also evil at first but softens, Annette is good-girl, and Ceccile is seriously naive and innocent.
A great buy - purchase this movie!
