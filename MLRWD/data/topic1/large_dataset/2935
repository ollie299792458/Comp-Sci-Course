On the whole, I like John Travolta and Nicholas Cage, in some respects, Travolta plays an amazing badass bad guy and Nicholas Cage can play the good guy pretty damn good but in FACE OFF, there is a serious Role reversal of sorts.
Travolta plays an FBI Agent Sean Archer, who has been tracking terrorist Castor Troy for years and steps up the search after Troy "accidently" kills Archer's son while trying to kill him.
A gunfight ensues at the airport when troy tries to make his escape by plane and gets "killed" there without revealing where he planted a device, which when detonated, will kill the population of LA. (May have the city wrong, doing this by memory right now).
The only other person who knows the location of the device is Castor's brother and he's in prison and he isn't talking so there is a new technology that allows face transplants so the idea comes about to transplant Troys face onto Archer's body and plant Archer in prison, where he will get Troy's brother to tell him where the bomb is.
Unfortunately, this is a movie and everything doesn't go quite as planned, Troy wakes up from his "Death", which turned out to be a thought to be irreversible coma without his face, walks around the unit where the transplant took place and puts two and two together and decides to have his goons round up the team and bring them to the facility for a late night procedure.
And all of this is like in the first 45 minutes to an hour, of course, I left some stuff out but I can assure you, it just gets better from here.......Trouble ensues and loyalties are tested and this movie is one rip roaring BANGfest!

This movie definitely gets 5 stars in my book as being one of Travolta's and Cage's best, I reccomend it to anyone who likes ACTION at it's finest!
