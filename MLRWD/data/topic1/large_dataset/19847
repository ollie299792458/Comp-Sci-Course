I had already owned the HD DVD version of this movie--I already htought it a masterpiece --not only in terms of Jet Lis acting and martial arts but also the quality of the cinematography and music.
The Directors Cut is just as facinating and changes the cadence of the story telling as well as fleshing out portions of the characters;
I was surprised that the audio on teh Blu Ray seemed quite surpressed
compared to the HD-DVD--and considering how stirring the Japnese penned music is, was disappointed by that;
Additionally, I was also surprised at the lack of contrast and rich colors that were present int eh HD version vs Blu Ray...(of course HD lost the war, so these comments are probably superfluous!)
Anyway---if you are a fan of this movie--it is a must own, even if you have the regular DVD or HD version...the Directors Cut is well worth it;
If you have not seen it yet and enjoy a good period epic or martial arts, it is also a must own---bravo!
One of my personal top 5 of all time..
