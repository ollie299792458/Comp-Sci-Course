I have to agree with most customer reviews, this is a popcorn movie and a damn good one. It's clear the producers put a lot of time and expense into making this the biggest "Mummy" movie to date and it was fun to see all the original actors assemble again for the sequel. I have to agree that the ending sequence with the "Rock" was cheesy at best and could have been eliminated. The dvd is superb and gives your channels a great workout, especially in the in the rear and subwoofer channels. The image is sharp and clear, near reference quality but the extras for the most part are pure marketing on the part of Universal. The first film had better extras although you'll find many of the same in this one as well, eg: director commentary and cgi demonstrations.  Rent it or buy it. You'll love it so long as you (a) haven't bought into the movie critics negative reviews beforehand and (2) you're watching it simply for the fun of it. Isn't that what most films are all about...pure escapist entertainment? In these pressing times, we need more like them! Enjoy!
