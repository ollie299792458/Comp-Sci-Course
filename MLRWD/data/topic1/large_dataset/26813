I was initially skeptical about this movie, but quickly forgot my worries about historical inaccuracies and any possibly long and boring musical sequences. While the whole movie is clearly focused on Mozart's genius, I soon developed a strong empathy with Abraham's Salieri, feeling a compassion I don't usually feel for any fictional characters. Salieri is constantly tortured by Mozart's superior achievements, odiously hating his rival, and yet, respecting him and admiring his work as if divine, directly dictated by God, since he believes Mozart is God's chosen composer.  This struggle has its peak in the simply beautiful 3 minute sequence with Salieri reading the music brought to him by Mozart's wife, mentally hearing every note while standing in hate, envy and awe of his rival's genius, which he understood and loved better than anyone else, and yet, kept reminding him of his own mediocrity as if some sort of God's cruel joke, finally ending with Saliery burning the crucifix while accusing God "&lt;..&gt;Because you are unjust, unfair, unkind". One of the strongest sequences about the human struggle between corrosive envy and absolute admiration I remember watching in movies.
Mozart's unaltered music obviously adds much of the movie's impact, and I'd strongly recommend that you watch this movie on DVD with a good sound system if possible, Dolby 5.1 will be perfect.
While normally not my kind of movie, I had to admit I enjoyed watching it, and soon forgot about all the fiction (or at least apocryphal events) being told about Mozart's life; it was never dull, full of humor and worth the 150 minutes, especially for F. Murray Abraham's wonderful performance, that fully deserves the accolades.
