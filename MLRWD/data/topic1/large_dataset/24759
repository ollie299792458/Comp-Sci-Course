I liked it and found it to be well-paced compared to some of its contemporaries (although it is still a bit slow compared to many modern movies). The big surprise though was how much my six year old daughter enjoyed it, laughing out loud like a banshee several times.  I think that's the first time she's done that when we've watched a film together, and believe me we've been through a whole library. Perhaps it was because of the somewhat sinister opening, which may have frightened her a bit and built up the expectation of some nasties to follow, when in fact the comedy comes on stream instead. So perhaps she was laughing out of relief.  Or perhaps it was just the excellent performance of Mr. Ustinov, a fine comic actor with wonderful delivery and timing.  I wouldn't personally describe it as a hilarious film, but it does have some great set pieces such as the field sports scenes where the ghost helps hopeless Godolphin on to victory.  Moreover, it is one of those films that leaves a pleasant aftertaste, and a slightly nostalgic wistfulness for a simpler time with simpler movies
