My first impressions watching this film were that it had too much of the technical quality of the TV show "Dragnet" - a stiff lead, stock and caricature immigrant male secondary players, static camera, procedural - but slowly it began to work it's dark and dirty magic on me. Mike Hammer is a piece of work without context or psychological background to pin him. As a viewer, you naturally identify with the lead actor and root for him to solve the mystery, but he's doing it by whoring out his secretary/love interest for information, roughing up people with sadistic pleasure and balking at cooperation with cops. He is not your typical 1950s movie archetype. "Kiss Me Deadly" has terrific sex bombs, particularly Gaby Rodgers, who reminded me of a young Diana Scarwid. She appeared in only one other film, which is unavailable. The procedural moves along its paces with only the easy women and rough and tough Hammer keeping it from completely falling asleep until we finally get to the heart of the matter, and then the film absolutely leaps to life and even more than 50 years later is gripping. The scene in the locker room is as good as sci-fi/paranoia filmmaking gets. Criterion Collection, which never does anything wrong, has produced a brilliant Blu-Ray reproduction of this black and white film. The extras, particularly the interview with filmmaker Alex Cox, are worthy additions. He discusses the classical allusions to Pandora's Box and helps you contextualize other aspects of the film in a short of maybe eight minutes. There is a big difference in feel between this and the classic film noir pictures that came before, particularly its inorganic nature, that Dragnet thing, which, for me, subtracts a star. Nevertheless, well worth watching.
