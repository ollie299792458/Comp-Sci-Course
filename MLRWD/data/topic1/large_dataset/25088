In comparison to "The Omen" and "Damien - Omen II", The Final Conflict is rather weak. It doesn't bring the mounting tension of the earlier films to the satisfactory conclusion one would expect, and Sam  Neill's portrayal sometimes lacks a certain intensity. As a horror/thriller  film, it's not particularly successful either. The horrific elements are  restricted to a handful of scenes and the characters (Dean, Kate, the  priests who assist Father DeCarlo in his hunt for Damien) aren't always  fleshed out the way they should be. But there are some nice touches, like  Damien's monologue in his dark "chapel" and the grand foxhunt  sequence. Jerry Goldmith's score is an interesting mixture of bombast and  subtlety. And Rossano Brazzi is always enjoyable to watch. 
I found the  ending awkward and somewhat muddled, and contradictory to key plot points  made in the previous films (notably, the importance of having all 7 daggers  when trying to destroy Damien) but the film is worth at least a viewing.
