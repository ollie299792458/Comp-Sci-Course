Firstly, this review is more for hardcore horror fans, and there are a few minor spoilers.  Other more casual movie-goers trying to figure out if you would like this movie... you should rent some Fulci so you can have a better idea what you're getting into before buying this.

Wow.  Just wow.  This is a really (infamously) gory movie, one I really like, and I've had it on DVD for a while...  But that didn't prepare me for the HD gore.  I have never gotten sick from a horror movie, but the City of the Living Dead blu-ray had me nearly gagging.  The HD reveals a lot compared to the DVD version.

The famous maggot scene has to be seen on blu-ray to be believed.  Their sheer number is absolutely amazing, and on Blu-ray you can see that all of them everywhere, covering the floor, in the air, and on the actors are very real.  Tens of thousands of them.  Again, WOW.  The intestine vomiting is probably the most disgusting thing I have ever seen in my life, and is SO much worse in HD.  In the making of, it's revealed the actress was actually had a mouthful of freshly slaughtered lamb meat (so the innards wouldn't stink).  Blech.

This is one of my favorite Fulci movies, and Hi-Def brings Lucio's solid direction to life. I was able to pick up on many details I had missed watching it on a smaller standard TV, and the plot was more involving.

Finally, the bad.  There are a few times during the film (most notably in the earliest scenes) where the HD reveals flaws in the film.  At moments it looks too light to me, a bit washed out and noisy.  But for the most part the movie, and most importantly the effects, look incredibly shocking and great.
