This is a fun little movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.  It belongs more in the "camp" than the classic horror category; but if you like campy little b-movies, this one is well worth the price.

A waxwork museum comes to town, and a mysterious man invites some teens to come to a special showing at midnight.  None of the teens are in any great danger of winning an award for acting, but by b-movie standards they aren't too bad.  As each teen is lured into crossing the velvet rope and entering an exhibit, they also step through into the scene that inspired the exhibit.

This conceit provides an excuse to show teenagers "living out" scenes from every horror film from Night of the Living Dead to Dracula (with the Wolfman and Mummy thrown in for good measure) . . . and to a surprisingly long "homage" to the Marquis De Sade.  The finale involves a gang of "oldsters" riding to the rescue led by a wheelchair bound John Steed from the Avengers (or at least the actor who played him.)  At the end of the climatic final battle the waxworks are burned to the ground and the forces of evil vanquished . . . except for one pesky little ambulatory hand.

The sequel picks-up right where the first film ends, but with a different actress in the role of the female lead.  The "undead" hand from the first movie kills the stepfather of the female lead, and she is accused of his murder.  Our protagonists have to find evidence to substantiate their alibi/tale of black magic.

This time we are treated to watching our two lead characters wandering through a whole new set of scenes from "classic horror" movies:  everything from Frankenstein to Aliens and the Haunting (with a great cameo by Bruce Willis) to the mall scene from Dawn of the Dead.  This double feature is never in any danger of being confused with great cinema, but it is a lot of fun.
