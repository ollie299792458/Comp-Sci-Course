I must admit, having seen various incarnations of this classic on video, that I expected very little, vis-a-vis the DVD version. Boy, was I surprised! This is yet another triumph by Blackhawk Films. The image  quality is superb, with color tintings that greatly enhance this seminal  silent film. Lon Chaney is, of course, magnificent as the demented and  malformed Phantom who haunts the Paris Opera House. His most well-known  role (deservedly so, how DID he create that extra-ordinary make-up?) is a  timeless one, as a man longing for love, but who can never obtain it. This  version features a beautiful symphonic score by Gabriel Thibaudoux, and as  far as silent films go, a very impressive one. A newly mastered version at  the correct running speed of 20 frames per second, from the original 35 mm  print. Trivial? Not if one wants to view this classic as it was meant to be  seen. This version also features an essay by Michael Blake, Chaney expert,  on the inside of the case. An altogether superior version, highly  recommended by a Chaney fan of over 30 years.
