I grew up watching "The A-team". And when I found out that Hollywood was going to make a movie, I started loading my guns. People were going to pay if they screwed this movie up after some of my other childhood favorites being destroyed. (tip of the hat to the person that mentioned "The Dukes of Hazard" because that movie made me want to punch kittens!)

Then I found out that Liam Neeson was taking on the role of Hannibal Smith. Having first seen Liam in such greats as "Krull", "Darkman", "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace", "Love Actually", and "Taken"... I figured how could they go wrong? And the cast of "The A-Team" did not disappoint!

Granted there are a great many "Easter Eggs" in this film, small editorial glitches that go generally unnoticed, it still delivers a powerful action packed kick to the daddy bags. The characters are believable with out being over the top, and every one did their homework on the original cast. A guest appearance from an original cast member from the television series in the extended cut is just the icing on the cake.

If you love action and comedy, and you love it even more when they are in the same movie, then this is a movie for you. I will admit that having a pause button on hand was almost a necessity because we were laughing so hard. I didn't realize how much I missed in theaters from all the laughing. "The A-Team" is a dynamic movie enjoyable by all!
