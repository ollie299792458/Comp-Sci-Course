Many people seem to have made great reviews around here. At first, you could say it pales compared to the Matrix movie. It lacks great visual effects, action, dazzling camera work... etc. But as time goes, this movie completely destroys the Matrix! and I mean it. The "philosophical" issues raised by the Matrix seem like a walk in the park compared to this. Typical issues of "existentialism", (a branch of its own in philosophy) are raised all throughout the film. This seems like a favorite topic of Cronenberg in his movies. He always likes to send his audience home thinking.

There are many similarities with his opus Naked Lunch. too many to even start writing them here. This is like Naked Lunch, but where the video game eXistenZ replaces Interzone city and video games in general replace drugs. As usual the cast is flawless. This time I was more impressed with the secondary characters than with the central characters. How could you not like Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe's acting?

I would give it 4.5 but I can't, so I give it a 4. The only reason is because it is just a little bit below the greatness of Naked Lunch. Maybe if Dafoe and Holm had more screen time and the movie was twenty minutes longer, it would be comparable.
