This is, perhaps, my favorite movie of any genre of all time. Since I have been a movie addict since I was a teenager many years ago, that is pretty strong stuff. I think the Pixar team outdid themselves on this movie, and I've loved every one they've released previously. The animation is fantastic (machines as people?), the scenery is breathtaking, the story and subplots are rich and well-done and the characters are believable and endearing. The storyline brings alive to the American public the way our desire to "save ten minutes" has essentially destroyed the towns and businesses along Route 66 at the same time destroying the values and innocence of a period in our recent history when family and neighbors were the strength of our nation. This is not a nostalgia piece so much as it is a wake-up call to what we have left behind in our cellphone/internet/instant-everything/lowest price/high tech/do-it-now society. The funniest scenes: tractor tipping and Mack making faces in the tank truck reflection.
