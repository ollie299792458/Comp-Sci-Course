I have read the Ray Bradbury story and I like it.  This movie takes it and spreads out the very short story into an almost two hour movie.  It does ok for what it is.  The story is vague and mysterious at times without much scientific explanation on how the world did change.  The acting in this is decent, the special effects for a movie costing in the range of $55-80 million is anemic at best and the short story probably shouldn't be drug out into a full movie.  Yet it was.  I paid for an used DVD of it and I am ok owning it.  I'd probably watch it a second time.  I like how the writers explored how Rand turned into a catfish like creature and explained more of what was going on in the world.  It was a much more violent change than in the short story, where the unwanted president candidate in the beginning gets elected and language is somewhat modified.

I think a lot of the loads of money spend on this movie was wasted.  Overall, I would give it four stars.  It was entertaining, ok acted, good ideas, graphics that seem not as good as what a 80 million dollar budget would allow...but it does take me back to the great 50's type sci-fi movies.  You have to suspend the disbelief, but it is a fun romp if you do...just wondering why this movie cost so much to make.
