Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is not only beautiful and breathtaking in its imagery and animation, but amazingly accurate in its portrayal of the Old West. Whether we want to admit it or not, early American settlers did forge a trail across this continent that changed its landscape forever. To be politically correct would be to deny the events of this history.
As a horse lover, I found it refreshing that the writers chose not to give the horses human voices. To have done so would surely have taken away from the film's heart.
As for one 12-year-old reviewer's remarks about the definition of "Buckskin" and "Paint" horses, I recommend researching Kiger mustangs, the models for Spirit, which range in color from Buckskin to Dun and which all are characterized by the black dorsel strip along their backs. These horses are direct descendants to 17th century Spanish mustangs and are today strictly bred to maintain the integrity of their bloodline. A good place to learn more about these true wild mustangs of the west would be springwaterstation.com. Also, the American Paint Mustang, before Paint horses were recognized as a "breed," were referred to as paints by Indians long before anyone thought to breed them for their unique markings.
The methods used to break wild horses to the saddle in Spirit may seem brutal, but how else do people think it was done, especially by the United States Cavalry? Many of the same methods continue today with horses that prove more difficult to handle than others. At the same time, there are those who believe a more gentle approach works just as well.
Overall, I thought Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron was an amazing depiction of the West from a unique perspective before it was conquered by civilization. Viewers should enjoy it for what it is, an animated tale told without talking horses that sound an awful lot like prominent actors, one that was developed with considerable thought and care to accuracy.
