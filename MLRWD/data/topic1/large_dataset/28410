I was hugely dissapointed in this film, which I purchased soley on my love of the television series.  What a mistake.  While it makes a nice edition to my collection, up there on the shelf with my M*A*S*H Season 1 thru 11 boxes, it is likely that I'll never watch it again.  To be honest, I can't even really say that I watched it once; I stopped the film about 15 minutes after the whole "Frank and Hot Lips over the P.A." bit.  It was just becoming to painful to watch. This film has found a home on my list of "Most Over-rated", right along with The Godfather and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

I do not mean this review to disparage fans of the movie in any way.  My main point here is that I grew up watching the TV show and, after that, the movie just didn't cut it.  My biggest complaint is that the jokes and pranks played by Hawkeye and Co. aren't fun and ultimately harmless as they are in the series; the characters as they are portrayed here are sexist, childish, and mean-spirited.  The silver lining? Except for the presence of Gary Burgoff as Radar, the movie is so completely disconnected from the series that it in no way affects my love for the TV show.
