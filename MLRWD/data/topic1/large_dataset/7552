I saw this around the time it was first released and have recommended it over and over--it's near the top of my list of favorite films. As far as I'm concerned, this is a must-see and am glad I finally own it. The captivating storyline portrays real-life difficult situations that anyone could experience and keeps you guessing. The performances from both the principals and the supporting cast are all superb. This is truly an ensemble cast; the three principals don't overshadow the supporting cast at all. (I was particularly taken with Dan Hedaya's performance; he impressed me in The First Wives' Club and does the same here.) Depp's seemingly effortless portrayal of a physically demanding role provides jaw-dropping amazement and humor on a grand scale. His performance here just ratchets up my admiration for his mastery of his craft. (The DVD extras didn't spend nearly enough time on how much training he went through, but what -was- shown was astounding. An excellent illustration of what hard work goes into portraying a role.) Great music, comedy, a believable and excellently portrayed story of comedy, romance, and conflict between self-sacrifice for family duties and responsiblities vs. letting go. This is a heart-warming film that will have you humming the music and leave you with the feeling that difficult situations can be resolved with the best possible outcomes for everyone involved--given some imagination, trust, and love.
