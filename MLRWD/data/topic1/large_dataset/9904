When the Spielberg version of "War of the Worlds" hit theaters, viewers started submitting their reviews to Amazon. To read them, one would think, "This must be the worst movie ever made".  I myself gave it less than 5 stars, mainly because of A) Tom Cruise's incredible invincibility in that film, and B) Dakota Fanning's irritating screeching. I can still hear her screaming in my mind.
So, to all those who sent in their movie/DVD reviews slamming that movie, I suggest a cure: see THIS version.  The acting is good enough, but basically it's 93 minutes of NOTHING. Color lenses are overused to great detriment, the pastor agonizes over his shaky faith ad nauseum, and the few action scenes in it are done in "splatter mentality" for that truly cheesy feel. The aliens spit some kind of flesh-dissolving goo, reminiscent of the "poison-spitter" from Jurassic Park. Yecchh.
Once you've "experienced" this one, you may feel like giving the Spielberg version 5 stars or even more! (Or then again, maybe not....)
So watch this on TV, and if you can't do that, rent it. But whatever you do, don't BUY it! I did, and lost my money. Save YOURS.
