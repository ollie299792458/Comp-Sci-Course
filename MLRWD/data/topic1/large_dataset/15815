First let me say that I love this movie ! Always have. I even own a copy in the Laser Disc format, which by the way contains the whole movie. Unlike this new release and the previous one which do not. Yes you heard me right this release and the previous one DO NOT contain the whole movie! What is missing you say? The INTERMISSION and ENT'RE ACT music are gone. Anyone who is familiar with this film will know what I'm talking about. Is this nitpicking ? You bet! But I think as long as they are going to release a movie in ANY format, it should be the WHOLE MOVIE! Warner did it with ICE STATION ZEBRA which contains the INTERMISSION. Why not this one for WED? I already sent warner video an E-mail bitching them out about it. There is no difference between this release of the movie and the previous one for those that care. If your a film purist like me E-Mail them at [...] and complain. Go to the bottom of the page where it says contact us, and click on it. There was absolutely NO EFFORT put out by them to make this release special !
