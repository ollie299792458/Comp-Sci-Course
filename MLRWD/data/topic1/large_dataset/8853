Pitch Black was probably the most overlooked movie of the year. With an excellent plot and near perfect acting, this movie should have been more publicized! The story is definitely as strong as Alien. But a little more intense. As most Sci-Fi movies deal with space and aliens, this movie combines them and tells the story better than most. What is it about? Well, I don't want to give away the entire plot, that would ruin things. However, I will tell you this. A group of space travellers are on their way to a space settlement when all that can go wrong does. Marooned on a planet and accompanied by a vicious criminal(Vin Diesel), the travelers think getting off of the planet will be simple. But they think Vin Diesel is the only nightmare.They soon find out that it is not Vin Deisel is the least of their worries! Pitch Black is a nonstop adrenaline pumping thriller! The special effects and visuals are wonderfully done! But lack of media attention has kept this movie out of the spotlight. Definitely worth adding to your Sci-Fi collection!
