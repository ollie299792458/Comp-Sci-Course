Should I try to review The Mask of Zorro? That's been done competently for years. By now, most everybody has seen it...but not this way in Superbit. Granted, it's not Blu-ray quality but it looks significantly better that standard DVD and miles ahead of the VHS copy we had subsisted on for years. Superbit simply uses all or almost all of the disc space by transferring the movie at higher bit rate but still keeping within the DVD format. Any extras that would have been found on the original DVD have been moved to a second disk. Playback in 720p, my 57" HDTV's native resolution, on our late model upconverting Panasonic player looks simply sumptuous! I found it to have great detail in every aspect despite our TV's size and lower resolution. Imagine what it would look like on a higher resolution TV. Is it worth it to replace your standard DVD? Only you can answer that question. If you're a BD user, probably not. If you don't see your self moving up to Blu-ray in the near future, you just might.
