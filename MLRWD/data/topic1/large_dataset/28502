When I heard Oliver Stone was going to direct a movie about the life of Alexander the Great, I was not optimistic. I thought it would be full of Hollywood tripe. For those of you who either don't know or don't want to admit the facts, Alexander the Great was an incredibly tough homosexual man who conquored most of the known world during his time. He was an amazing man who overthrew wicked dicators much more bloodthirsty than he was, and he brought peace and prosperity to much of his lands for a time.

The fact he was a homosexual is VERY important...because his most elite army was also homosexual. The bonds and love and lust and life these men shared helped lead them to their victories. Oliver Stone did a superb job in portraying Alexander as 'bisexual', which is ok, because Alexander as King did have an obligation to marry and procreate. And I'm sure he loved his wife, but not in the same way he loved his life partner, best friend, and male lover, Hephaestion. Stone did a remarkable job in helping to bring this love into the light.

Apart from Alexander's sexuality, there is a wealth of characters and influences and causes and passions surrounding his life which do make a very compelling story. This is a wonderful movie, tasteful and extremely well done. Yes, it could have been better...and it might be boring to homophobes who can't get over historical fact. Yet this movie is well worth the price and several viewings.
