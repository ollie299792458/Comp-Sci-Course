I consider "Edmond" a parable about a man seeking his true identity.  In the beginning a fortune teller shuffles her tarot cards and informs him that he's not where he belongs. By the end of the film Edmond discovers where he DOES belong - hint... its not in society. William Macey is incredible at playing "The Fool" as he leads us down the dark alleys of Mamet's fool's journey.  Edmond goes through a real transformation at the end.  Of course, what he discovers is not what most people would consider enlightenment or what Hollywood would consider a happy ending. Lets just say that Edmond is more suited to the contemplative life.  We all struggle to find our place in the world.  You've got to at least give Edmond credit for trying.

I found this film more than provocative - and it definitely made me think.
