i enjoyed this movie from beginning to end!!! i REALLY don't understand why everyone couldn't enjoy a film like this but yet they can enjoy "40 year old virgin", "knocked up", "superbad", "forgetting sarah marshall", "the hangover"....need i go on??? this movie was absolutely hilarious! i loved every minute of it! cameron diaz's character is the kinda character i like seeing in a film! a pretty rude, lazy and mean person getting their way throughout the whole movie! u never know if they're gonna get caught or not...i'll let you find out on your own! but i really think this movie is for people who like to laugh and of course i highly recommend this movie to all Cameron Diaz fans!!!! i've been waiting for this film for months and i can't say i didn't find one thing i didn't like about the film....EXCEPT for the obvious racist line that was used in the end of the movie by the antagonist teacher about the new school she was going to teach at. i mean come on, do black jokes really need to be in white comedy films? WTF. anyway, this movie was great! screw anyone else who hated! they CLEARLY don't know TRUE comedy!!!! trust me folks, you're gonna LOVE this movie!
