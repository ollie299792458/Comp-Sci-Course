Everything stems from this one movie."Silence of the lambs"."C.S.I". Know it! Give William Peterson the recognition he never received and in my opinion there is'nt anything anyone can do to make up for a great injustice. Remake of "Red Dragon" which i thought was the biggest slap in the face to William Peterson, repeating every line word for word, give me break. Manhunter should have been re-released in theatres and i dont care if it made less money than "Red Dragon". Check out "To live and die in L.A." "Heat" and (old favorite "Day the Earth Stood Still" a movie which is still way ahead of its time.) if you havnt seen them yet. I have to ad i think Anthony Hopkins stands as one of the best actors out there........But William Peterson did a great job. One of my favorite movies of all time. I guess i have to add "Silence of the Lambs"  and remaking Red Dragon may have made William Peterson.(More people learned about "Manhunter") But i loved "Manhunter" before Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon ever were released.....
