Let's get this out of the way at the beginning.....I was never really an ABBA fan, from the beginning. I managed to miss every touring company that played LA, though I would have loved to see and hear Judy Kaye as one of the friends in the original Broadway production.  Now there's another incredible actress singer treading the boards.  But I was lucky enough to have seen Meryl Streep sing on stage (her brilliant version of Surabaya Johnny from HAPPY END on Broadway in the late 70's beat Bette Midler's version recorded around that time).  And that teaser at the end of POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE....c'mon, the woman is a national treasure.

So I saw the previews.....take me to that island right away.  Certainly a total rip off of BUONA SERRA, MRS CAMPBELL, but set in Greece.  And a chick flick?  Chicks over 45.....don't forget they are still alive and vibrant.  And Streep, Baranski and Walters lay it on with gusto, joy and lots of fun.  In fact, that's what I liked most about the film: everyone seemed to be having a good time.  And what's the problem with Brosnan's singing?  Does everyone have to sound like Pavarotti?  I think everyone brought a sense of play and fun and romance to a pretty thin script.

And what was wrong with the long line dances on piers and patios?  Anyone caught the Rockettes lately?

It's a musical aimed at the over 40 set, and I had a terrific time in the Mediterranean sun for a couple of hours.  And I will definitely get the film to re-enjoy it all.  So TAKE THAT all you grinches out there.
