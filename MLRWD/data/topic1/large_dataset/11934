I remember watching these on Sunday nights back in the 70's! The set is neat as there are one dvd of Hardy Boy episodes which has two sides then the other dvd has Nancy Drew episodes which has also got two sides.  This is, if I recall correctly, not the original order of how they aired it seems like they would air a Nancy Drew episode and the next Sunday air a Hard Boys episode....finally in the later seasons I think Nancy & the boys finally joined as a team for a few times....of course it has been years so I could be mstaken.  But watching these after not seeing them in almost 30 years brings back lots of memories and they are "new" to me in a sense because I hadn't seen them in ages. I love Starsky & Hutch, Charlies Angels, Dukes Of Hazzard too...those 70's & 80's were the days for good action packed shows like they just don't make anymore.I wish theyd release the other two seasons and they need to release Bionic Woman & Six Million Dollar Man too!!! I did read Isis is due out next year which is great!! 70's TV on DVD is MUCH better than Tv Land or cable TV anymore...
