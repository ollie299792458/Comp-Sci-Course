This concert is probably one of the best concerts i have ever been too.... it had everything... hot dancers, great music, hype crowd, and one of the greatest female groups of all time...

i thought they should have filmed this concert in houston... but it was great that the filmed it in a great city with great response....

im always lookin forward into how they perform my favourite song by the ladies 'survivor'.... honestly this is probably the best performance in the entire concert to me.... the salsa dancing, the dance break, kelly's dance intro... all that good stuff... and as a special bonus, monica shows up at the end of the song with flowers....

michelle handled her business during her set.... she even surprised me by the way she was sangin'......

another performance that i loved was the 'solider' performance... in houston mike jones & slim thug came out and did his thang!!! but on here... the original rapppers on the track came out and handled it... when T.I. and Lil' wayne came out in total suprise...

everything from the beginning from the show to the very teasin' shower from the girls i loved every single min of it....

i recommend this concer to everyone and anyone who did not see this performance....

5 stars out of 5
