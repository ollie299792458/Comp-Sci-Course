Ponyo has very rapidly made it into my personal top 3 favorite films of all time (right up there with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002G1K82Q">Across the Universe</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00128VA76">Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium (Widescreen Edition)</a>). Between the exceptional animation, inspiring characters, and heart-warming story, this film successfully captures an audience of 1-100 and beyond.

The visuals in this film are awe-inspiring... from Ponyo running gleefully along huge waves comprised of water-fish, to the magnificent sea spirit portrayed in soothing, powerful colors, to the elderly running free of their wheelchairs in an aquatic orb reminiscent of "Eden"... this movie is guaranteed to light up the hearts and faces of any child.

The storyline is such a beautiful portrayal of childhood innocence, and the enduring nature of unadulterated genuine love. Ponyo shows no hesitation in trading magic for humanity in the name of love, reminding us all that power and possessions are of little importance.

The characters are almost personifications of positive emotions. Ponyo herself is the epitome of the most unwavering, naive, pristine joy we could all use a little more of in our lives. Be it a light bulb, a bucket, or HAM, everything is an exciting new discovery that "blows her mind" in the most wonderful way. Sosuke is inspiring in the way he doesn't question anything, and just allows life to take him on a beautiful journey. "My fish is now a little girl"... "That prehistoric fish has come to life"... "The elderly can run again"... none of these concepts seem far-fetched or unbelievable in any way to Sosuke. Sosuke's mother is wonderfully dysfunctional yet determined. When Sosuke sees Ponyo running atop waves in the midst of a storm of biblical proportions, she stops the car in order to look for the little girl, trusting her 5 year old son in a way few parents trust their children.

All in all, this movie is a must-watch for any family. I personally watched it with a group of friends and family ranging from less than 1 year old to 35, and we all shared the same hysterical giggles and elation.
