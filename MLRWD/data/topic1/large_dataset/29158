This is a great Yoga DVD.  I would not recommend the tape as the DVD has tons of special features that allow you to not only learn each pose as you go through the workout, but also allows you to choose which level you would like to practice.  Its not nearly as rigorous as Living Arts' Power Yoga series, but I like this pace a lot better because its easier for beginners to follow.  "Beginner" in yoga does not necessarily mean someone who's never taken a yoga class before.  Remeber, beginner in Power Yoga means someone who can balance on their hands with their feet crossed in the air!
I've been reading some of these comments that say this workout is hard to follow because Deason does not offer instructions on how to move in and out of the poses.  Well, there's a little feature called "Personal Instructor" which you can turn on to interrupt the workout and show you the pose.  This feature is clearly discussed in the instructions on how to use this DVD.
Give it time and learn all the cool features about this DVD.  I"ve managed to lose some weight using this DVD and basically nothing else.  I used to wake up and do Tae Bo or some other aerobics.  Yeah, I lost weight... but I've also lost wieght doing yoga and I find that I've gained a greater focus even though I do not practice meditation.
I recommend this DVD.  Its challenging, but don't let that stop you.  And READ THE INSTRUCTIONS before you just press play on your DVD.
