Season Four of "Buffy, the Vampire Slayer" was definitely a transitional stage for the show. That may be the reason why so many people dislike this season. Gone are the high school days, gone is the privilege of the Scooby Gang always being around each other, gone are two crucial characters Angel and Cordelia, and gone is the hot-spot of discussion -- the library. In is a new campus, in are two new characters Riley and Tara, in is Scooby Gang separation, and in is a new villain. All of these differences can bring down the feel of the show; change is hard. However, one thing I noticed was the arrival of the new big-bad -- Adam. Maybe it's because he's man-made and has no mystical threat, or maybe it's because he's only in the season towards the end. But one thing is for certain, and that is that Adam is not very convincing. One thing about Season Four is that it never gives you that Oh-My-God-It's-The-End-Of-The-World-What-Do-We-Do feeling like seasons one through three. The tone of the season is light and more playful, rather than dark and disastrous. Adam isn't brought in until the end of the season; there is no build up to the climax finale and there are too many filler episodes. All of these things make people turn their noses up to the season. However, Season Four isn't horrible. There are still great episodes, the gang's chemistry is still there, and the humor is ever-so present. Plus, it's still Buffy, and if you're a true fan, you'll accept it like it is and go on. 
As for the DVD set, it is great. The color scheme is black (Season One was blue, Two was red, Three was green) and centers on the Emmy-nominated "Hush." It folds out six times to reveal six discs. Each has a character photo printed on the front, as well as on the DVD episode menus. There are a bit more special features than the other sets and it is easier to navigate; it gets right to the point. Overall, I think the Season Four DVD set is worth your time and your money. You can take a stroll down Memory Lane with this fabulous season!
