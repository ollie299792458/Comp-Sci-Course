OK, I watched this movie with my 74 year old father and brother-- motley crew, I admit.  I was a bit concerned, because the movie is pretty raw--- but my dad couldn't stop laughing at the opening scene--- the "Ameican Pie" send-up.  He was laughing the type of laugh where you shoot snot out of your nose and can't breathe and your gut starts hurting.  THAT is how funny the first scene in the movie is!  (You can thank the absolutely brilliant Chyler Leigh for her pitch-perfect performance.)

Now, it's not quite the funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie---I think the vomiting puppet scene in "Team America" would have to earn that glowing distinction--- but it's still darn funny.

Unfortunately, that being said, the rest of the film is just sort of average-- notwithstanding two other scenes of almost equal hilarity. (In order to keep it clean, I'll just call these "The Staircase Scene" and "The Toilet Scene.")

The scene at the end of the movie with Molly Ringwald is also priceless--- but the stuff in the middle is rather bland, tries too hard, has really disturbing bits that are trying to be funny in a gross-out way but are really just gross (like the girl wanting to have sex with her brother, eviscerating a retarded boy, and having a kissing scene between a 19 year old and a 75 year old), and uses really raw langange in the worst possible way (that is, not FUNNY, but rather just ARBITRARY and distracting).

I don't know if I'd spend the time watching this again, but it earned its three stars with those three funny bits alone.  (Chyler Leigh was the best part about the movie.)

I am glad I saw it once, though.
