Kevin Smith's relationship comedy follows his low-budget splash debut Clerks and his... disappointment Mall Rats as the third part of a "New Jersey" trilogy.  
Set in Manhattan and the quiet Jersey shore city Red Bank (Smith's hometown), Chasing Amy follows the exploits of Holden (Ben Affleck) and Banky (Jason Lee), who produce the successful underground comic book Bluntman & Chronic, which is based on Smith's continuing characters Jay and Silent Bob.  When Holden's pal Hooper (Dwight Ewell), a "militant" black artist (who sees a homosexual subtext in Archie comics!), introduces him to feminist cartoonist Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams) he is immediately attracted...and undeterred when he learns she is gay.  Eventually, Holden convinces her to sleep with him, but that only complicates his relationship with Banky.
Much as the film begins as a male-dominated fantasy of lesbian conversion, Holden's discovery of Alyssa's true past leads him into emotional tailspin and turns the film into an exploration of the absurdity of sexual politics.  Smart and surprising, it deftly brings Smith back on track for the filmmaking potential he showed with Clerks.
