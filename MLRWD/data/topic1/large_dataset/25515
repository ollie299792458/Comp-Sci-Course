In the small town of Ayer, Massachusetts, a woman is brutally murdered. When Kenneth Waters (played by Sam Rockwell) is arrested, his family didn't believe the charges. Even through trial, they all believed in the justice system and that he'd be released. This time, the system didn't work. Betty Ann Waters, Kenny's younger sister, (played by Hilary Swank) watched as her brother was convicted for a crime he didn't do and sentenced to life in prison.

What makes this story so amazing is Betty, a high school dropout, gets her GED and though it takes her over a decade, she earns her law degree in hopes of freeing her brother. The movie gives insight into her motivation and sacrifice as well as spotlighting a real life organization called The Innocence Project.

I don't usually watch tearjerkers as I was sure this was going to be one. Since I'm a huge Hilary Swank fan, I couldn't resist. On a tearjerker scale of one to ten--one being no tears, this ranked about a three or four. I didn't out and out blubber like with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ASLJQI">Million Dollar Baby</a>. The film was high on emotion, but more on drama. Even though it has an underdog wins theme, Kenny Waters spent eighteen years of his life behind bars for a crime he didn't do. Although Betty was able to get her brother's conviction overturned, neither can be labeled a winner here. Both lost too much for that.

I highly recommend this one, especially if you are a HS fan. Sam Rockwell was also phenomenal in his role as Kenny Waters.
