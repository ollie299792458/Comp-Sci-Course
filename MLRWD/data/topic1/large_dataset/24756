Please note that despite the packaging's attempt to make this look and sound like a decent low-budget horror film with good special effects (even making the cartoon characters look possibly computer animated in the images on the back of the box), it's really just a horrible movie filmed in 3 days on a home video camera.  The acting is horrible, the sets are horrible (even consisting of things like cartoon backgrounds drawn on hanging sheet), and the movie is mind-numbingly low-brow and apparently only exists for its high gore content, a sentiment which is reinforced by the fact that the intro, previews, and plea to join their fan club...all seem to cater towards a cult following of patrons interested in nothing but pure low-brow gore.
Like some of the people who reviewed the DVD version, I didn't make it very far into this movie, and actually apologized profusely to the people who I unwittingly subjected to it with my uneducated rental.  Don't be fooled into a rental..or *gasp* a purchase...by the packaging...this movie is utter...and isn't worth watching even for hardcore horror fans.  The only thing I learned from watching what little of this movie I could stomach is to avoid Brain Dead Films like the plague.
