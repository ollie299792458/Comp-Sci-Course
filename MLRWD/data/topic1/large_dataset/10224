I was an avid fan of this series since I first saw it back in 1996. I never thought it got the attention it deserved, and I was convinced I'd never see it on DVD.

Well I've been pleasantly surprised.

For those who don't know, The Pretender is a show about Jarod (Michael T. Weiss) who, after years in captivity at the Centre, where his super-genius was unknowingly used for ill, wishes to right the wrongs of the world he sees in some sort of pennance. Every episode Jarod assumes a new identity to seek justice for those who can no longer speak for themselves. This usually involved inflicting whatever torment the victim endured on those responsible before turning them over to the proper authorities. You could call him a vigilante, but I prefer to think of him as a Benevolent Sociopath.

The only negative thing I can say about the show is that it is more than a bit formulaic, especially in the earlier seasons. But that's half the fun, like a good detective who always gets his man, it's the joy of watching him at work. Later in the series we get a lot more backstory on the Centre gang, and a very solid story arc, to which regrettably we never see closure.

As far as the DVD set is concerned, it's relatively bare-bones. The video and audio are both crisp, or at least as much as you can expect from a 10 year old cult tv show and probably a couple notches up. The box set is very compact, on 4 double sided discs, two discs to a slim-case and two slim-cases to the box set.

The flipper discs annoy me, but not enough to detract from the end result, which is a solid box set of an excellent show at a reasonable price with insightful extras. If you were ever a fan of the show there's no excuse not to pick this up and if the description intrigues you there's no better time to check it out.
