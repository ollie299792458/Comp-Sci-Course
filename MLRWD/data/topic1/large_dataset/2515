This "toy" movie, I believe was one of the greatest animated  movies made with "toys" enjoyed all over the nation. It had a  great quest and a great plot filled with loads of funny scenes to laugh at.  For example the one in which "Rex" tells the pigybank that he  comes from Mattel after hearing "Buzz" saying he xcame from  "somewhere in the galaxy...". Truth is many toys do come from  Mattel, Fisherprice and Playschool. It was really great that the creators  of this movie could incorporate this in thre movie.  I believe the contrast  was great between "Andy" and "Sid" and I believe it  gave a great example to all kids and adults of the way to be abd the way  not to be. All in all I can truly sat this movie was really innocent and it  showed the unison and special bond that kids have between cute pieces of  stuffing and plastic. This movie is one of my favorites for the fact that  it gave me the chance to become a kid once again and because many of the  adults were there once. But I guess my biggest thing that I learned from  here is that I still believe that one day people will learn how to take  care of others as humankind in this movie has taken care of and has had a  great unison between plastic....
