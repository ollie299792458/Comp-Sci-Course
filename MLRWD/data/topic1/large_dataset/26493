I think some of the reviews for this movie are way too serious. It is clear from the beginning to the end; this movie wasn't meant to be taken seriuosly. In real life both the Duke boys would have been in jail for eluding the law and destruction of property. I grew up  during the time of the original series, didn't watch it much , but I do remember the characters. There were defintely contrast to the characters in the moive and the ones on the show. Willie Nelson was a good choice for uncle Jesse. The two leads were good choices for what they were required too do. Jessica Simpson was somewhat of a departure from  the original Daisey. It was good too see Linda Carter doing something. The guy playing Roscoe was a little creepy. I have never been a fan of this type of movie, that's why I din't watch the series. I am however, a fan of Burt Reynolds, though he wouldn't win an award for his portrayal of Boss Hogg. The body types were defintely different. Burt did a good  job at making you beleive he was Boss Hogg. I think that's all that matters.
