I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it in Toronto back in the early 80's.  It remains one of the top 5 movies of all time for me.

When I started buying DVD's in 1997, I put this movie on my list of "movies I have to own".  Over the years "Shirley Valentine", and "Educating Rita" finally came out on DVD and I bought them.  This movie is the last hold out.

I cannot understand why the executives at this studio won't release this movie to NTSC DVD.  There are over 130 reviews of this movie... and all of them extremely positive.  What more do they need from the fans of this movie before they decide to release it????  I guess they are not interested in making money!  Either that or they are very stupid.  When I think of how many terrible movies are released on DVD each year, it stands out as a shame that this movie has been passed over time and time again.

It is so easy for a studio executive or employee to look this movie up on Amazon, and realize that customers want this movie.

So.... PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE - RELEASE THIS MOVIE TO NTSC DVD!!!!!!!!
