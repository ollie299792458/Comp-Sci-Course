A great anime show and these first 27 episodes are great considering they're ice breakers to introduce the concept of the show and the characters.  Quick overview:
Its been 10 years since the Meji Revolution and when the legendary Hitokiri Battosai, the 1 man who tiped the balance of power during the bloody feud, was last scene.  He reapears in Tokyo in time to encounter a martial artist in need, Miss Kaoru, whose style of swordsmanship was being tainted by a fake Hitokiri Battosai.  He then befriends a number of others; Yaiko, son of a samurai whose family was forced into service by a local gang.  Sanoske, who was part of a group working for the Imperialists during the revolution but was inevitably betrayed by them.  Miss Megumi who came from a family of doctors but was forced to develop opium for an underground businessman.  
You also meet a bunch of other characters you'll see later or their precense and/or impact is felt later like Aoshi of the Obiwan group.  A lot of the episodes in this 27 pack are linked to a bigger story you seee in the second collectors box containing episodes 28-46.  
The animation is excellent, very beautifally detailed.  Fight scenes are lacking but are quite amazing when you see them but this show isn't about fighting rather the story behind fighting.  I highly recommend this for anyone from ages 12+
