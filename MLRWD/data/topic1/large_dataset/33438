I have three cathegories to movies "based" in PKD's work:

First cathegory: "Good PKD Adaptations". The movies are: "Impostor", "Screamers" and "A Scanner Darkly"

Due this comment is for "Screamers", I'll say is a very underrated film. Sometimes slow, but always good. It captures the PKD's dystopian way.

Second cathegory: "Bad PKD adaptations". The movies are: "Blade Runner" and "Total Recall". I dont care what you or they could say (Im not just a PKD's work fan... I have papers and disertations about him and his work) Those are excellent, terrific, tip top Sci-Fi movies BUT ARENT PKD's adaptations. I can accept that maybe are "loosy based" movies... (Warning: Im talking about the link between PKD's work and the movie, not about the movie... I watch "Blade Runner" or "Total Recall" every weekend at lunch) "Paycheck" is a special insert here: is a "Bad PKD Adaptation but a Bad to Death Boring Movie"

Third (the last and the least): "An Insult to PKD works and SciFi readers". The movie is: "Minority Report". The worst PKD adaptation and a bad movie in general terms.

"Dont read PKD with eyes, read it with mind. And you will find VALIS..." (this phrase is registered, dear fellas)
