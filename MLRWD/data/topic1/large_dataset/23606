Very, very good and a bit sad.  And most frighteningly there is a scene early on in the movie that shows show Jack Lemmon working in an insurance company in a sea of desk.  I would say "pre-cubicle days" but it was nearly duplicated at an insurance company in New York in real life around 1989.  Had I seen the movie beforehand I would not have been able to work there without giggleing every time I entered that gigantic room.

Fred MacMurray was wonderful, and in this movie I can really see what people saw in Shirley MacLaine.  And it really started me off on watching more movies by Billy Wilder.  Which are adult films in the right sense of the word.  If you are 16, the odds really are that you are just going to "get it".  There are things to laugh at, but the horror aspect of it all might not be apparent.

The black and white film will put people off, but it suits it.  It was the last black and white film to win "Best Picture" (at least I think so) and it deserved it.
