Hollywood heavyweights Robert DeNiro, Marlon Brando, and Edward Norton together with Angela Bassett deliver very nice performances in this beautifully shot, nicely edited, and well directed film.
The cinematography is beautiful and even without the cast, the visual elements alone -- the film noir lighting and atmosphere, the elegant and stylish set designs, the framing, and the editing -- make this a very enjoyable film.
Although some reviewers comment that DeNiro is on "autopilot" or that he and Norton "phone in their performance," this is not true at all.  DeNiro delivers a very smooth and appropriately subtle character without going "over the top".  Likewise, Norton also gives a very good performance.
Each character in each film should be viewed on its own merit.  People who are disappointed because they don't see the "fireworks" of DeNiro in "The Deer Hunter" or Norton in "American History X", frankly, should go see those movies instead.  DeNiro and Norton both are right on the mark for this movie.
Marlon Brando brings comic relief with his superb timing and lines that land every time.  Angela Bassett also is very good and shares the scenes nicely with DeNiro, which is no easy task.
The heist is a genre that arguably has been overdone and is almost a cliche, but in this film, the direction is excellent and the editing, the pace, and the rhythm all support the suspense and the tension that kept me on the edge throughout.
There are a few weaknesses, however.  Although the music score is good at the beginning, by the third or fourth time the same melody appears, it stops being a motif and turns instead into a bit of a bore.  A definite cliche that we can do without is the proverbial computer hacker.
All in all, this film provides for a nice movie experience and is worth owning on DVD.  A must see for DeNiro fans.
