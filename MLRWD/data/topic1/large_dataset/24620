I bought this movie before I saw merely because Kirsty was returning, and thought that it would be a great movie, but it wasn't.  Although I do own every Hellraiser that they have made, I personally don't agree with the direction the filmmakers have taken with the series.  I would rather them stick with what the first two installments was about.  I will say that the acting of this movie was great, but the story line was a bit poor.  I was I guess hoping for Kristy's character to save her husband, or save someone, instead of the direction it did take.  For those who haven't seen it yet, I won't give the ending.  I believe that the true Hellraiser fans will be a bit disappointed with this one, as it tries to incorperate the other hellraisers and then tries not to refer to them.  I guess of fear that whom ever will watch this movie won't be left out if they haven't seen the rest of the series.  Even though I was a bit disappointed with this installment, I would have to say that this movie was quite better than bloodline or inferno.  See it if your curious.
