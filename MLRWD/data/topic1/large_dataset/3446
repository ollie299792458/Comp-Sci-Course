The DVD of Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is well worth its price and then some.
In addition to the film, there is a short documentary about the making of the film and some other bonuses.  Best of all is the option to view the film with voice over commentary by the now-adult kids who starred in it.  They are very chatty, recall a good deal of detail from filming, and seem to enjoy discussing it.
The film itself is engaging and should keep the attention of most younger viewers.  Some adults have expressed their concern that Wonka has a dark or scary tone for a children's movie.  They may be right, but it is not gratuitous, and is necessary to the story.  And while parents may fret about that, I don't yet know of any kids who do.  I loved it as a child, and my children do as well.
Gene Wilder is superb as Willie Wonka, delivering a character both charming and menacing.  The other actors, regardless of age, are all fine.  The young actress who plays Veruka Salt is especially good, and at her best in her song (which is a favorite in my family).
