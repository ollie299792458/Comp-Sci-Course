I am a big fan of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, but it wasn't until fairly recently that I actually heard of this movie.  After doing a few online searches I found more info about the movie.  My roomate bought it online and we waited.  When we finally got it and watched  we had no idea what to expect other than we knew it was a low budget movie.  This movie proves that you can make an excellent movie with a small budget.  The music in the movie isn't the best, the singers other than the girl and Trey Parker can bairly carry a tune, but the script, the camera work, the odd, but funny story, the cast, and the over the top funny songs make this movie a cult classic.  Most people might not like this film or even get it.  But I find it amazing consindering the Trey Parker film production experience he had at the time.  This was his first full length movie he had attempted up to that point to my knowledge.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone fans will sit back and enjoy this piece of pre south park history.  The rest of the world unless you have a open mind and are not expecting a big budget masterpiece don't bother.  I love this movie and I would recommend it to any south parkatteer.  By the way, after watching it, I went out and got lucky by finding it in the comedy section of a Circuit City store.  .....Fudge Packer.?!
