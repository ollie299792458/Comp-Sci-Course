I just picked up an HD-DVD player with the recent price drop. One of the 1st things I purchased was The Ultimate Matrix Collected in HD-DVD, Batman Begins and Army Of Darkness.

Now I will admit I was not a huge fan of the final two installments more because of my expectations of what I wanted them to be. However after not seeing the whole trilogy for quite some time I felt this was a great way to re-introduce myself to the series. Wow it really has held up and HD-DVD is the only way to watch this. The quality cannot be matched. If you think that there is not a big difference between the standard DVD release and this new HD-DVD transfer then you either do not own a real HDTV set, have your HD-DVD player hooked up wrong or your eyes are just shot. No doubt there is much improvement which improves the viewing of the movie for me and really brought me into The Matrix.

I still have my issues with the 2nd installment and the whole rave scene which really drags down the movie until it's over with but hey that's the beauty of the skip button right?

In any case for the extra $10 I ponied up for The Ultimate set as well it was only $10 more so why not.

Fantastic quality all the way around. Great addition to my ever growing collection of HD-DVD now that I am a proud owner of one.
