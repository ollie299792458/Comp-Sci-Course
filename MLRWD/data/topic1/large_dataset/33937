This is a great little B-movie suspense noir. Gorgeous Jeanne Crain boards a cruise ship to honeymoon with her new hubby after a whirlwind romance. He leaves their suite promising to meet her in the bar in 15 minutes... and simply vanishes. Crain starts looking for him, but no one can recall having seen this mysterious husband at all. There's no indication she came aboard with anyone. Their suite is empty and her baggage is in another room. The crew starts believing she's delusional--even the sympathetic doctor, played by Michael Rennie (The Day the Earth Stood Still). He spends a lot of time with her (who wouldn't), trying to cure her of her hallucinations and hysteria. The fog-shrouded nights help build the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia, which grows steadily thicker before finally lifting at the denouement. Old B-movie noirs were made on shoestring budgets (this one was filmed in under 3 weeks!). Frills were out, so they had to rely on good storytelling. This is a dang good one!
