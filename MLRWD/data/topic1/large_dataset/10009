I really enjoyed this movie. It's about a young man in college named Alan, who is a straight republican writing a book about homosexuality. Tommy is an openly gay man who is trying to change people's perception about homosexuality and move its rights into the mainstream. They ultimately fall for each other, and Alan decides not to publish his book when he realizes that he is gay too. That was in 1973 when they met, and 4 years later, the book gets published against his wishes, and it pushes Tommy and Alan apart. Tommy finds out that Alan is the one who wrote the book. In 1984, Alan gets a message from Tommy, that he is sick and wants to see him to bring him to his doctor in Texas. Alan is living with another man, who he learns was the one who revealed that Alan was the one who wrote the book, which in turn caused a breakup between Tommy and Alan. Alan travels to Mexico to bring Tommy to his doctor in Texas, and they rediscover their love for one another on a road trip. The movie is funny, touching, and moving. The supporting cast is great as well, like Alan's mother and his friend, give plenty of laughs along the way. A wonderful movie worth watching over and over.
