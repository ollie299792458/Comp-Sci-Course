I can't bear to rate a bond film badly.
Here we are
Thunderball- Excellent film. Underwater action at its finest, strong villain and plot, nice bond girl and good allies.
On Her Majesty's Secret Service- This is the bond film that holds the distinction of double rankings in my personal ratings. It gets a tie for second if you discount Lazenby and the relatively poor editing. It gets down to 20th in official films only (twilighteye, this is why NSNA is not in the sets, as it is an 'unofficial' film made by WB and ken Mc Clory) because of Lazenby. He is in my opinion the worst actor ever.
Every single supporting actor does an excellent job, and Diana Rigg does an excellent job as one of the most important Bond Girls ever. Savalas' Blofeld is great, and Ferzetti as Draco is unparalleled. 10/10 (without laz) OR 1/10 (laz included)
P.S. Timothy Dalton turned down the contract on grounds of age for this film, though he would have been great if a bit young.
LALD- Ranking at third in my personal list, LALD is one of the better Moore films. An egotistical villain that isn't going out of his way to APPEAR menacing, and a really cool bond girl. Great plot and J.W. is hilarious.
OP- I like this movie a lot, even if Moore is a bit old. It ranks 14th in my rankings but I wish it could be higher. I just like a lot of other movies :)
AVTAK- this movie is just SAD. Roger moore is, bluntly, OLD! Couple that with a really bad bond girl and even the great Walken as Zorin cannot save it.
DAD- 19th out of 20th. This film is essentially a RIP OFF of Diamonds are Forever. And just about everything not from DAF is from another bond film. Digital effects suck. good main villain, and Frost is hot enough to melt her name, but they can't save it.
