Watching this DVD was so incredible I checked my pulse a few times to make sure I hadn't actually died and gone to heaven. With a band like the Cure, who's career spans a couple of decades and several albums, you don't get to hear a lot of their older stuff live, particularly the obscure stuff from albums. 
This DVD contains all of the tracks from three of their "darkest" albums performed live last November. ALL OF THE TRACKS! It's unbelievably great. 
I've seen this band play in 1986, 1987, 1989, 1996 &amp; 2000. They are fantastic but the way they played in this DVD was just amazing. Robert approached these songs with reverence and feeling and that came across in how he sang them. The band was incredible as well. 
Buy this DVD. It is so worth it. In addition to the music, there is also an interview section, along with outtakes from the interviews. This is a MUST HAVE for all Cure fans. If you "sort of like" the Cure, you should also buy it because this DVD will seduce you into LOVING them! :)
