Paul Scofield's quiet, dignified portrayl of Sir Thomas More is one of the most riveting performances one will ever find.
With a determined, yet not brash or unseemly stance against Henry VIII (Robert Shaw, in all his young glory), More creates a devastating question for the viewer:  how long do our principles remain dear to us.  To discomfort?  To imprisonment?  To death?
Perhaps one of the most endearing qualities of More's character is that he does not waver.  It is a quality that is only universal in the sense that it is respected by all men and possessed by very few.
In the end, perhaps the only validation More is given is the dignity of his death, his detractors exposed as dishonest, biased men.  Is that enough?  Certainly More was able to change little of history by the manner of his death.  It did not stop the divorce OR the Anglican church.  Perhaps the only prize integrity has is itself.  Certainly More himself believed a much higher reward awaited him.  After watching this movie, regardless of religion, you will find yourself hoping he was right.
