Anyone who saw Hotel Rwanda may also wish to see this well directed movie
about the gripping Rwandan conflict in 1994. This is a story of two brothers whose political standing became divided by the genocide which engulfed the nation into a chaotic nightmare, a small but beautiful African nation unjustly abandoned by the international community.The movie depicts a genocide which consists of an organized attempt by the Hutu majority to exterminate the minority Tutsis. Not by gassing as the Final Solution  applied to Europe's Jews in World War II, but by bullets,clubs and, of all gory ways that could be thought of by the human mind, machetes imported from China. Moderate Hutus(Hutus against the horrible persecutiuon) as well as heroic Hutus who risked and gave their lives to defend their Tutsi neighbors and friends were also targeted for murder. The lot more easier to identify Tutsis ,thanks to the Belgian Colonists who issued Identity Cards to distinguish Tutsis from Hutus during those colonial times. The admissions of guilt, the confessions, remorse and pleas for forgiveness can not make up for the senseless slaughter of loved ones as experienced by the protagonists in this movie although they are trying their best to forgive and start a new life. However,those memories will linger for the rest of their lives. Rwanda in 1994 has shown the world that without any genuine and effective effort of control nationally and internationally, genocide can still haunt this planet we live in.
