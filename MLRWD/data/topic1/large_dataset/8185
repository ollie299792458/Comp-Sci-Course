While the film itself only merits 3.5 stars - it's a run-of-the-mill teen comedy will the requisite eye-candy cast - the commentary track on the DVD earns this film a 5 star rating.

I don't regularly listen to commentaries, but for some reason on this one I did, and am very glad to have done so... it is far funnier and more enjoyable than the film itself.

The commentary features the young stars, the director and the writer.  What separates this commentary track from ordinary ones is how fun and personable the commentators are.  They sound like they are having a blast watching the movie together, and that spirit is infectious.

Much of the commentary has the cast and director lightly poking fun at each other (especially targeting "Dakota Channing" Tatum, the film's alpha male, who can stand to take a little ribbing).  This might seem like it would get tedious, but I couldn't help but laugh along with these people for the duration of the track.

If you own or plan on buying this DVD listening to the Cast audio commentary is a must!  enjoy.
