This is a movie you should see more than once!  It will infiltrate the recesses of your mind.  After reading all of the reviews I reconsidered what I saw.  I think the first time you see it, it rankles your sensibilities.  The more you see this film, the genius becomes more subtle.  It creeps you out, then it creeps back into memory and provokes conversation with others who saw something different.  Maybe a classic!

Oliver Stone has given us brilliant contemplation with all of his movies.  Whatever he does, he hones to a pure, bare revelation of our culture with all of the nuances of our humanity.  It's tough being challenged and I guess unless you have a liberal epistomology, you go kicking and screaming with preset ideals.

Tolstoy said "the most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already, but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him."

I also admire Stone, he went to Vietnam as an infantryman and received the Bronze Star and Purple Heart, and as we know W was busy gassing up his plane here in the States.  I'll stick with Stone!

Platoon is his story presented with moving interpretation......
