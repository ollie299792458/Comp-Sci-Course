Reed Richards, Ben Grimm, Susan Storm,her brother Johnny Storm and Victor Von Doom all get struck by a storm in space and soon after they all start to change....I mean literally. Reed Richards, played by Ioan Gruffudd (King Arthur), can stretch any part of his body....he's rubber. Ben Grimm a.k.a. The Thing, played by Michael Chikilis (FX'S The Shield), transforms completley into solid rock...even his heart is made of rock. Susan Storm, played by Jessica Alba (Sin City), can make herself go invisible and her brother Johnny Storm, played by Chris Evans (Cellular), can yell "flame on" or snap his fingers and his whole body can turn into flames and he can also fly.....these 4 are the Fantastic Four. On the otherside of the table there is the 5th member, Victor Von Doom, played by Julian McMahon (FX'S Nip/Tuck), who finds out his whole body is becoming metallic....he can manipulate things like light fixtures and sockets in the walls. Then, Von Doom gets really pissed off at the Fantastic 4 sprouting "this is what happens when someone truly embraces their destiny" and he tries to get rid of the Fantastic 4. What this movie needs is a shot of adrenaline. When the action kicks in towards the end it goes somewhere but the corny stuff in the middle we dont need. Michael Chiklis gives an unimpressive performance, Ioan Gruffudd is so-so, Jessica Alba was too weak and Chris Evans was too over the top in his performance but he did have his moments. Only Julian McMahon as Von Doom was the highlight because McMahon can play a sinister bastard pretty darn good and he kept the movie at bay for the most part. Some of the dialouge, basically one liners from the 4 are really stupid. Truly doesnt have nothing on what Batman Begins offered which was much better. Of course there is the cameo by Stan Lee, creator....some might spot him, some might not.
