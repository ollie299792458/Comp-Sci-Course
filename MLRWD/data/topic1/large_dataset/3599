The Criterion Collection has done a fabulous job at restoring this Film Noir classic to 1080p, video is crisp, absolutely top notch. The director keenly used the wet streets of Post-WW2 Vienna as the stage, effective and intriguing. The steaming streets almost had an eery life to them. But what struck me the most was the brilliant sound-track... It rang out in just the right places, plenty loud, but never interfering with the dialogue.

Orson Wells was spectacular, a mysteriously missing "third man" for half the film, then appears with a shot of a kitten purring at his feet! Somehow he plays the villain, but reels in the audience to be cheering for him in the fantastic finalee sewer scenes. An exploitation of man's sense of greed.

Let's not forget Joe Cotton and Carol Reed as the love triangle. How could it be done any better then the third man coming back from the dead? Reed plays the perfect and the most beautiful saddened soul.

No question this is classic film, one that should be on everyone's "Must Watch" list. And if you can, see the Criterion version on blu-ray, visually and sonically stunning! The list of bonus features is more then any movie buff could ask for! Too bad it is now out of print on Criterion, as the Studio-Canal BD is pale in comparison.
