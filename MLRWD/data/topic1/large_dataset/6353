Personally, my five stars apply to all but the last half hour of the movie. That time was brilliant! The story was different and fascinating. The use of a narrator was wonderful and enhanced the movie (Whereas a lot of narrated movies flop in my opinion because they don't know how to use a narrator, especially an omnipotent one}. Visually the movie is simply stunning. They take an abstract and fanciful story and put it in a visually realistic movie, which makes it simultaneously more believable and fanciful. Now the ending had two problems for me. I am not a huge fan of nudity in movies, but up until the end the nudity was tastefully done and in context did not offend me. However toward the end was a mass orgy where I found the context of the nudity unnecessary for furthering the plot. You can understand perfectly well what is going on without the nudity or even the mass orgy. My second issue was that the ending pushed the fanciful aspect of the movie into an area where I had a hard time suspending my disbelief in order to continue enjoying the movie. But, the time preceding the last half hour was so brilliant it made up for the ending.
