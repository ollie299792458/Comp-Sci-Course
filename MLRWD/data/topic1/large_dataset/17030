This movie was surprisingly bad. Despite the generally positive reviews from Amazon, and the combined force of Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken, I couldn't wait for "Nick of Time" to end.

First off, the plot was so absurd, it was laughable. I don't usually like when somebody calls a movie unrealistic, but "Nick of Time" was exactly that. It is nearly impossible to enjoy the film given the ridiculous story line. Even if you manage to get past the story line, the movie is not suspenseful in any way. You'll predict the ending after the first five minutes.

Secondly, although I love both Walken and Depp, neither is at their best in this film. I can't even blame them given the poor script. This story would make the performance of any actor hard to believe.

Finally, there are absolutely no redeeming qualities from the film. I've seen movies that were altogether much worse, that had at least something I found interesting. This movie just didn't have anything at all.

I would recommend you avoid this film, because you most definitely will be disappointed. If you are a fan of Walken and Depp as I am, avoid it anyway. You can find these two in a ton of other excellent movies.
