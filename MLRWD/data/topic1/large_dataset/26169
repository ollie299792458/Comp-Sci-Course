FINALLY it's here and released on DVD, Cry-Baby the Director's Cut!  This extended version is worth every penny for the serious, die-hard Cry-Baby fans.  Like myself, who knows every line word-for-word, I of course found myself getting tongue tied and silent on parts that were new to me for the first time. Things started to make sense to me with the included scenes, for instance what seemed to be out-of-place scenes of the sleezy Kojo character, or the infamous courtroom scene where the "F" word is bleeped out repeatedly (not in this version friends!).  Mysteries like this and much more are revealed through the indepth "It Came From Baltimore" featurette.  Always wondered why you saw a different version of the movie on TV as opposed to the theatrical version on your then VHS?  Or what about that classic pic on the back of your VHS cover of Wanda (Tracey Lords) seductively lying in a large champagne glass that you never saw in the original?  And just what does the cast look like almost 15 years later?  Loads of deleted scenes and extras make this worth the wait for anyone who has grown to love this cult classic.  And the thought of John Waters playing with our emotions during the sit-down interview about bringing this movie, like Hairspray, to Broadway, makes you appreciate it all the more!
