My six year old daughter and I loved it. We laughed thru out with the other kids and parents in the audience. I loved the penquin's more than she did, but most parents I spoke to felt the same way. Chris rock was great as was ben stiller and the rest of the cast. This wasn't the best ever of the new kids animation's out in the past few years but its one the best. My daughter talked about it for days afterwards to anyone who would listen. We even went to see it again the next weekend. She's never done that before and I've been talking her to the movies since she was three. We have all the stuffed animals and a few posters in her room. I'll defitently be adding this to our dvd collection.

Highly recommmend this one for all kids.. and big kids too. IE: Single Dad's like me!! If your a parent and you didn't like this, then you probaly weren't raised watching Bugs Bunny cartoons...and you don't have a good sense of humor..

We even went to our local Zoo so she could see the same animal's there as in the movie. I sang the song "I like to move it move it" at the monkey cage and I had my daughter sing along too!! We had a blast..

Buy this.. You won't be sorry..
