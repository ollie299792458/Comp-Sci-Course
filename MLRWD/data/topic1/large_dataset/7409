Although this film has a murder in it, it is really not a murder mystery.  The murder simply serves as a maypole around which the large cast of characters and the many subplots weave in and out.  For me it was a fascinating portrayal of the British class system, extending as it does from the Aristocrats (and Wannabees) to the servants that wait upon them.  The chief complaint among the reviews that I read was that it was hard to hear.  Those hushed tone are purposeful.  Since everyone at the country estate, Gosford Park, has a secret agenda he or she is pursuing (money,illicit sex, a past to keep hidden), the characters must often speak to each other in hushed tones. What reveals their secret agendas often comes out in the sly and subtle non-verbal communications they carry on with each other. That it takes a while to catch on to each character and subplot is  also purposeful.  It's as if each of us (the viewers) is a first-time guest for this weekend "shoot" of birds and it takes us a while to catch on to the overtones and undertones of these people who are congregated under one roof.  I found it a remarkable and fascinating experience, as if I am catching glimpses of life in a country estate through a periscope and having to connect the dots from one scene to another.  I was willing to see it over and over (six times so far) to  catch every nuance and subplot.  The acting is undeniably superb.
