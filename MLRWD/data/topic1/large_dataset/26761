This is by far John Grisham's best books and movies of all. Although this was John's first book, it wasn't successful until one of more of his other books became successful. After the popularity of other books such as the firm this book hit the best sellers list. Then comes the subject of making this book into a movie. When John Grisham was foirst approached about turning it into a movie, he was somewhat reluctant because he felt the subject matter was to sensitive. He felt that without his input, the movie could not reflect what Grisham was trying to present in the book. After several of John Grisham's books were made into movies and were successful, I knew it was only a matter of time before "A Time To Kill" would be on the big screen. This movie is a great reflection of the book and maybe so because John Grisham had some influence over the production. The movie has an all star cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Matthew McConaughey, and Kevin Spacey. This movie is one of the best books turned into movies of the last thirty years. This DVD should be apart of everyone's movie collection. As this book will surely be a literary classic for hundreds of years to come, the movie will also be.
