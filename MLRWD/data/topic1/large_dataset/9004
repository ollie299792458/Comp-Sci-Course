I didn't know what to expect from this movie but I laughed all the way through it and even felt sorry for Borat a few times! The people who find the movie offensive likely have no sense of humor. NO "group" is left unscathed in this movie. Let's see we cover "Premier" Bush, blacks, feminazis, jews, gays, radical right-wing Christians, politicians, rednecks, uptight New Yorkers, and Hollywood, just to name a few.

The movie shows us our own idiocy. For instance when Borat is at the rodeo and he's talking to the guy who runs the rodio and the guy says Borat can't kiss him (as is Borat's custom) because he'll be seen as one of those fairy guys. And Borat says yes in his country they hang them and the rodeo redneck says something like "yeah that's what we're trying to get done here"!  And then there's the three drunk Univ South Carolina frat boys in the van. Three drunk redneck boys going off about how men are better than women and how we should have slavery in America.

The movie poked fun NOT at the jews, blacks or gays (among several groups) but at the people who were prejudiced against them! That is so obvious!

I think it was ingenious!
