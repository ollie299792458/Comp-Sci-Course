I bought this DVD on a whim without really knowing what Qigong is. I don't know what I was expecting from it, but I got more than I bargained for.

I have been following the instructions for the standing 8 Pieces of Brocade for a few weeks now. Not only do I feel more energized, but my anxiety and asthma have almost completely disappeared. Normally, I used to have a lot of social anxiety, but the exercises have made me so calm that I behave like an entirely different person- a very calm and cheerful person at that!

The exercises also wake me up and give me a lot of energy. I've been able to get more work done than I was getting done before I started.

Perhaps the best part of doing these exercises is that they make me feel calm and happy most of the time. I've been able to be a lot more patient than I used to be because small annoyances are usually less of a big deal to me now.

I'm sure everyone's experience is different when doing these exercises, but I've gotten so much joy out of them that I wanted to share my experience. Perhaps in a year or two I'll update my review, but even after a few weeks this purchase has been worth every penny.

Thank you Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming and David Silver for making this video. It's been a real godsend.
