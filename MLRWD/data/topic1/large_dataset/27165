"Love Actually" was generally a funny and entertaining film, but I thought they went a bit overboard with a few things. I could have done without the porn-star couple, for example, or the cliche "run through the airport before the plane departs" scene when the young boy is trying to catch the American girl on whom he has a crush before she flies off to America, perhaps never to return.

 There also wasn't enough development of a relationship between the PM and his caterer. First she hires onto his staff and embarasses herself profusely, then there are a few not-particularly-romantic scenes of them going about their general business. When the PM finds her in an awkward situation with the President of the United States, he quietly has her transferred to another department, thinking that's the end of it.

 Upon the unexpected receipt of a Christmas card from her, the PM suddenly realizes he loves her, which makes no sense since as far as we the audience know, he doesn't really even know her that well. It wasn't very believable to me that a man in his position would go to so much trouble to pursue a woman unless he suspected that she was pretty special, and I didn't get the sense from the story that he could have known enough about her to justify the lengths he went to.

 All in all, "Love Actually" is a fun movie with a positive message about weathering the good and bad of romantic relationships (and platonic ones like the aging rock star and his manager), so long as you're willing to overlook a few unbelievable aspects of the storyline.
