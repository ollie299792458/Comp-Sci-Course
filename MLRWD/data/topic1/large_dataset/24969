This is a nail biter!  I'm a lifelong murder mystery lover, having started as a teenager reading  Christie and King and watching Hitchcock and Selznick.  I love intrigue and fight nights!

I had my DVR set when it first aired and only taped the first 3 episodes.  Then it disappeared!  I have since learned that the network moved it to another night, and in fact finished airing the entire series.  I was so excited to DVR it on Christmas eve on the Chiller network and watched the remaining episodes in 2 nights while my kids were asleep.  It is a little too gory to be perfect for my taste, and too bloody for Tweens and younger kids.  However, the characters grabbed me right away, especially two of the main characters, Abbie and Henry.  This is not a masterpiece, but it gets very high marks for drawing you in and keeping you on the edge of your seat!  The building suspense and doom maintain that tension right up to the last moments.

Are there a few hokey scenes?  Yep.  Do the characters make some really stupid choices?  Absolutely.  But I'll allow for these imperfections because overall the recipe worked. I had such a good time being scared moment to moment, episode after episode.  Take this for what it is and you'll enjoy it, if this type of genre is your thing.

I will definitely buy this when the price goes down and watch it again.  I am sure there will be a lot to see the second time around, especially because I had to cover my eyes a lot!  As others have said, the pacific northwest is a gorgeous setting and the character development was exceptional.  Get ready to be bummed over the demise of your favorite character, as there is a good chance they won't make it on Harper's Island.....

Such a fun series!  I wish the series' creators would make another round for us enthusiasts, in another luscious venue of course.
