As a thirty-something guy I grew up in the 70s and of course we all loved the Planet of the Apes movies when they showed on TV, obviously the first  film is far and away the best of the series there is still much worthwhile  viewing in the other installments.  The social commentary is as valid today  as it was when the series began in 1968 (hard to believe it was that long  ago).  The real gem of the new DVD box set is the behind the scenes disc, I  recently caught part of this on one of the Satellite channels, Bravo or  A&amp;E.... I really enjoyed what I saw of it and am now glad I have a copy  of it for my own.
I got the set and brought it home, my girlfriend wasnt  too thrilled when I showed it to her and she only seemed to have a passing  interest in it and just wanted to see "the monkey people".  During the beginning she was panning the movie but more because of the  usual overacting by Charlton Heston but once the Apes appeared in the  "man hunt" sequence she really started to enjoy the movie and by  the end of it she was asking when we can watch the next installment so even  to somebody who never saw the films it turned into a very enjoyable  viewing.
I hope this set is successful and the Cartoon and TV series are  also released on the DVD format, hopefully with a few more extra  features......
Two big thumbs up from my house!
