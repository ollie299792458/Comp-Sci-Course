I bought this film last year and I have watched it so many times that I'm going to have to get a new copy. I loved everything about this film. The cast has this amazing chemistry and each actor really becomes their character. The story is so much more than hopeless drug addicts. It tells the stories of friends lost in time, so stuck in their comfort zone that venturing out of it causes complete chaos. This group is trying so desparately to hold on to what was, but eventually time has to catch up and force them to either change or die trying to resist. Everything in this movie stands out: the pain, the misery, the happiness, the comedy, the confusion, fear etc. The opening lines are classic: "I chose not to choose life...I chose something different." The other thing about this film is the use of music to shift time. There's none of those subtitles saying "three years later" or "1979". What the film uses instead is a brilliant soundtrack in which each track helps shift the movie to new year or a new decade. I have yet to read the book, but if books are better than films that I'm sure to be impressed. This film is not just a must see, its a must own and must see over and over again.
