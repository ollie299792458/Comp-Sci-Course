I was looking forward to buying this DVD from the moment it was announced to be released. And believe me, it didn't disappoint!!! The DVD reveals pretty much everything that happened during those exciting times. I was pleasantly surprised by some of the things that they recaptured, for example, when Vince McMahon was stunned those first few times by Austin, or when Shawn Michaels started the DX gimmick. Also, everyone who is interviewed in this presentation does not hesitate to tell exactly what they felt or went through. From the early days, to the NWO, to the Bret Hart "screwjob," to the Attitude era, to the later days, and finally to the abrupt ending, this DVD covers it all. And the extras make this DVD all the more worth it. One of the best extras is the story of how DX went to Nitro on that little tank. That is priceless!!! Plus, there are four matches (2 from Raw and 2 from Nitro), Jim Cornette commentary, the story of how Rick Rude was on both shows the same night, the last Nitro, and much more!! If your deciding on what wrestling DVD to get next, it should be this one. I guarantee you will replay it over and over again!!!!
