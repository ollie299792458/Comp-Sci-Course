Christmas in Connecticut (1945) starring Barbara Stanwyck, Dennis Morgan, Sydney Greenstreet, Reginald Gardiner, and S.Z.Sakall is an amusing story of lies, deception, and love. In short all the elements needed for a fluff comedy. Ten minutes into the film an experienced movie watcher will be able to predict almost every element of the plot.

Barbara Stanwyck who is pretending to be married so she can keep her job falls in love with a sailor, Dennis Morgan. Barbara tries to seduce him. He falls in love with her. Since this was made in 1945 and not 2005, he resists becoming involved with someone he believes to be already married.

The film is great holiday movie for the whole family. It is well worth watching.

However, the hidden gem of this DVD is the vintage Oscar-winning short: "Star in the Night."

"Star in the Night" is a modern retelling of an old story. It is told from an unexpected viewpoint that completely captures the true meaning of Christmas.

No flashy miracles, no Santa Claus, no big name stars, only a fine dramatic script with an emphasis on character development supported by a cast of solid character actors.

"Start in the Night" is the best, most moving holiday film I have seen in a very long time. This short (less than twenty minutes running time) is well worth the full price of the DVD.
