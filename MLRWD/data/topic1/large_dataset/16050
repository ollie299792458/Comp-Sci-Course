This is a humourous story of a bunch of toys. They weren't anybody's toys but Andy's toys. How these toys loved being Andy's toys. Whenever there were occasions where Andy would certainly receive presents, these toys would send out representatives (the green toy soldiers-whom the other toys regarded as "professinals" for missions of such) with a toy walkie talkie (a wee bit too huge for these mini soldiers), to find out what kind of toys Andy receive.  On Andy's birthday party, a toy spaceman (Buzz) was given to Andy. Since the arrival of Buzz, Woody's (a toy cowboy)position as Andy's favorite toy was threatened. 
One day, Woody planned to get rid of Buzz. He managed to send Buzz flying out of Andy's bedroom window. When Andy couldn't find Buzz to accompany him in the car-trip, so he picked up Woody instead. In the bushes near the car where Buzz had fallen into frm Andy's window, Buzz spied Woody being taken into the car by Andy. He followed. The two toys ended up fighting at the bottom of the car when the family stopped at a petrol station. They were so emgrossed in squabbling that they did not realised that the car was getting to leave until it was too late. 
There began their adventure of finding their way back home to Andy. They two rivals had to work together and plan a safe journey back. 
This is truly a masterpiece! I haven't enjoyed watching a cartoon soooooooo... much in a long time. The animation is really beautiful! And all those lovable toys... and the cute three-eyed aliens! 
Anyone will certainly enjoy this show!!!
