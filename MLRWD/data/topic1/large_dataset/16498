I've been a fan of Ghost in the Shell and all it's iterations since I saw the first movie in the early 90s... it is a science fiction phenomena, and a sounding board for discussions of the heady topics of transhumanism, cyberization, and the information society.

But as entertainment, is it for everyone?  Well, probably not.  And having watched this latest entry I can't see someone who had never seen any of it's pre-cursors following this labyrinthine plot for very long without getting irritated and switching it off.  If you're not a fan of anime, this movie certainly won't sway you like a Miyazaki movie might.

But to it's credit:  thoughtful, dense science fiction, focused on a very real social dilemma of Japan (the growth of state-hospitalized elederly against a declining birthrate/workforce), some of the finest computer enhanced (the lighting and color schemes are brilliant) animation to date, excellent music by Yoko Kanno (as usual) and wonderful english voice acting.  If you're collecting the series, come and get it!  It's top-notch.

If you've never seen it?  Well, I'd rent it, and if you like it, there's an excellent tv show I'd like to recommend...  ;)
