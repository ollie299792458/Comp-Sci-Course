I was very impressed with this version of Wuthering Heights. I felt that Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley had a passion for playing their characters, and had great chemistry, which I had not seen in previous versions. The cinematography was great, sound excellent, and sets and scenics beautiful. When I say this is the best version, that would be among those I have seen. In looking on the internet, there appear to have been at least 11 productions of this, plus, of course, the original book. I have seen the old one with Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, directed by William Wyler, and the one with Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche. All 3 vary a bit from the book, and all 3 are somewhat incomplete when compared with the book. But, until someone makes a 6 hour version or something, some matter has to be left out. What this focused on was the middle part of the book, which was the relationship between Heathcliff and Cathy. I don't think Lockwood is even mentioned in this film version. In any case, just the superb character portrayals, high production values, and brilliant backdrops make this a film worth watching. This will be one I will watch again and again, over a period of time.
