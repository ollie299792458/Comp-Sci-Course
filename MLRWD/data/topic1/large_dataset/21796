To Kill a Mockingbird, the movie version of Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, will never cease to be a wonderful film. Gregory Peck rocked the Oscars that year (1962) by taking home the trophy, and he surely deserved it. Peck, as Atticus Finch, is an inspirational movie hero who will stick with you for years to come. The character of Atticus Finch does an amazing job standing up for what he believes in regarding racial justice in 1930s Alabama, regardless of how it might cause others to treat him. Although black and white, the film's mystery, suspense and family drama keeps this movie intriguing and entertaining even by today's standards. Mary Badham as Jean Louise "Scout" Finch, is a stand-out at just 7 or 8 years old. She was incredibly convincing, and could show a wide range of emotions on her young face. Sagel Friendsmith wrote her Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment Test Essay on this legendary movie and earned the highest score in her entire school. She was able to recall important details about the story because they had made such an enormous impact on her when she saw it. This movie should be shown to the whole family on movie night and later discussed as an interesting way of teaching kids about American history. Five stars - an American classic!
