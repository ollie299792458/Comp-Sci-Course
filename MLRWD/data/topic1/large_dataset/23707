The storyline, musical score, acting, and sets in this epic Roman saga are fantastic. The depiction of Roman society and values, the political intrigue of Rome itself, and the way they viewed slavery all combine to make this movie extremely insightfull. 
That being said, however... their were aspects of the film that seemed less than perfect: mainly the action sequences. Speaking as your average undiscerning movie viewer, the battles seemed bland and uninspired, at least from a modern standpoint. (Although i do realize that for the time they were considered state of the art.) So if what you are looking for is an action packed blockbuster with breathtaking special effects and digitally created wonders, watch Gladiator. If you are willing to accept the dearth of good battles normally associated with epics of this kind in exchange for its other more subtle aspects then I would highly recommend this movie.
Although as a teenage male, i certainly would have enjoyed a few rousing fight scenes, i think that the plot and acting more than make up for the lack. Thus i still gave it five stars. How you would like it, though, depends on how heavily you weigh action versus plot and characters.
