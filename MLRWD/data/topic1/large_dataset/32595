Wow. That word comes to mind whenever I see this movie. Powerful, moving, and inspiring come to mind also. But the main adjective I'd use: REAL.
Terry Malloy's world is harsh and corrupted. Everything is done for the love of a buck. It's every man for himself, survival of the fittest. And the most important thing, you have to stay deaf and dumb if you want to see the next day. Mercy, conscience, and compassion are all considered to be weakness.
Though Terry lives and works at the docks and suffers at the hands of the labor leaders, his world resembles ours. Our world is brutal and harsh at times, and there are many instances in which being soft leads to suffering. And we face the same battle Terry faces: the battle of conscience.
Terry must decide whether or not to "rat" on his corrupted leaders, one of whom is his own brother. If he rats, he will be doing the "right thing" but will be putting his life at stake. If he stays D&D, he will be safe, but more and more innocent, honest men will suffer. We ourselves are often plagued with decisions like his; between taking the easy way out or the hard way out. That is what makes this movie unique; it shows a believable man going through believable anguish and moral suffering deciding on what to do.
But the best part is the ending. It is David and Goliath like...
