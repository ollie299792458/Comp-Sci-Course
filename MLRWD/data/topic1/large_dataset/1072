I bought this because I have tight hamstrings, although in general, I'm not terribly inflexible and out of shape.  This is a good beginner yoga DVD and I would say it's good for people who are a little out of shape.  What I don't like about it is that there are long pauses between the each set of yoga postures in a given routine -- I get bored and it's too much of a rest for me, but someone who's aerobically challenged might actually prefer this.  What makes this "yoga for inflexible people" is that the instructor shows you how to use blocks and other modifications to get into poses that might be challenging for a beginner.  I found that I didn't need most of the modifications (I may have tight hamstrings and touching my toes again was a strain at first, but I could do the camel pose shown on another dvd right off the bat, go figure).

What's great about the DVD is that there is a variety of routines to choose from, so if this is the only yoga DVD you purchased, you wouldn't get bored of it too easily.  The music is nice, too.

I gave it a "4" because of the pauses, which I dislike.
