Island at the Top of the World was probably not one of Disney's better live action movies.Most of the fans saw it back when they were kids in the early 70's and it has managed to hang in a few peoples memories. The acting isnt bad save for David Hartman who is barely believable. The story isnt bad but not very believable either. Still, you really have to appreciate the large matte paintings used for backdrops and sets. They must have been difficult to make.You also have to give Disney credit at the time for not making the lost Norse tribe speak English.With all the costumes and make up and sets it definitely feels like a '70s movie.

Surprisingly Disney managed to put some extras on this dvd. One short documentary, made just prior to the films release, is included. You have to laugh when the narrator says things like "this film is destined to become a classic movie" and "If X and Y and Z had happend, then a tribe of Norsemen could still be living today". Oh please!

Buy it if your nostalgic,or you appreciate the effort of movie makers back then, you wont be disappointed. Rent it if you have never heard of it.
