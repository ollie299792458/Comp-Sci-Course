I have mixed emotions about this disc. The video quality and sound are awesome to say the least. I think the surrounds are a bit too much, altough I may have to check my settings since Hi-def forums stated they didn't hear much in the rears except crowd noise. I hear a lot more instruments then I think I should be hearing. Any other thoughts on this?

Second I really like the way the fragile tour was filmed better then The With Teeth tour. I saw both the winter and summer tour last year and to this day was the best concert ive been to in a long time. With that, being there live just blows away seeing this concert on DVD. You just can't even compare the two. I think they should have filmed a lot more scenes much farther back, esp when there are scenes with front and rear lights and the screen during eraser and Besides you in time. Too many back and forth close ups on the slower songs; you really can't get the full effect of whats playing on the screen. Just my opinion. NIN is got to be one of the hardest bands to film anyways. I still like the old Trent in the Fragile Days. This whole buff and short hair just doesnt reflect the music.

I will say though watching this Blu-ray on my 109 inch screen with the Panny 1000U 1080P is quite the experience. I then put it on my Samsung 56 and was not even as close to the enjoyment as the big screen.
