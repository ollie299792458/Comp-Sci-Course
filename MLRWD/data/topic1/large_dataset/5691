Yip, if you've read any of the other 1-star reviews, then hopefully you've cottoned on. I think the person who most needs to understand is the director, Uwe Boll. As a musician and entertainer, it is important to develop thick skin, because there will always be some who don't like what you do. But I have standards, and in Nelson I'm well-regarded as an accomplished artist. Still I wrangle with self-doubt, and I strive to better myself. Uwe, are you getting the message? Just because you enjoy doing something, doesn't mean you are any good at it, or have the right to inflict the "finished product" on poor unsuspecting civilians. You must have the gift ot the gab to be able to get the funding to pull off dreadful film after dreadful film. Either that or your daddy is rich. Go away man! Stop adding to the already-too-big-trash-heap of lazy pointless "art" that those of us with taste have to wade through. Just go away, stop inflicting your films on the world. Take up waterblasting or something. BOYCOTT BOLL!!!!!!!!!!
