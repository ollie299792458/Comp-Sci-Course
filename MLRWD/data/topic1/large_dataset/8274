My low rating is for the DVD, not the movie itself. (Although I think the film is a little too mannered and is marred by some poor casting, it would have earned a solid three stars on its own merits.) The picture quality is abysmal, with a plethora of scratches, tears, squiggles, and all the other signs of a bottom-of-the-barrel print used for the digital transfer. The contrast drops almost to nil two-thirds into the film, rendering Welles' rich blacks into a uniformly soupy grey. Several scenes in outdoor locations look horribly overexposed, resulting in a bleached white frame that is almost physically painful to watch.  The audio track is just as bad, with crackles and a constant hiss making it difficult to understand the dialogue. (The absence of a subtitle track makes this even worse!) The only "extras" are a trailer for CITIZEN KANE and an utterly extraneous intro by Tony Curtis (who mispronounces "Arkadin" and continues his creepy habit of wearing black leather gloves). To top it all off, this is the version that excises almost ALL of Welles' original flashback structure for the film!  Bottom line: Don't buy this.  This is the most slovenly manufactured DVD I own, and an insult to our country's greatest filmmaker.
