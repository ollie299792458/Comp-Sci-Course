I must say, I was a bit surprised with this one...
ever since the previews first came out, my kids have been wanting to see it.  And I'm one who's not too picky, I watch just about everything...but didn't feel the need to spend $30 at the theatres, but with that being said, I much rather have spent the $$ on this one in the theatres than The Smurfs like we did.

So, we passed on it in the theatres, and just bought it on Blu-ray on release day...Way better than expected for me (and of course the kids loved it too, for the talking animals)...looking for a good family flick, you can't go wrong with this one.

Not that big of a fan of Kevin James movies (Paul Blart - awful in my opinion), so I was a little skeptical but he didn't bug me in this one, more of his "cute" personality in this one and the scenes with the gorilla were just awesome! Loved having Sandler's voice as the monkey, Jon Favreau, Faizon Love  were great as the bears as well....We liked it enough to watch it 2-3 times in the first 2 days we owned it.  Definitely a keeper!!
