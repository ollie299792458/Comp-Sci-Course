I am a graduate of a Christian University (Trinity Intl., Deerfield, IL) with years of Bible study behind me and ongoing.  At age 65 I have never seen any portrayal of Jesus as wonderful as this movie gives.  Bruce caught for me the essence of a loving, tender, open, "normal" being, full of joy and compassion. When Jesus touches people in this film, I feel the wonder of His love as never before, for I am sure that this was the way in which he interacted.
Anyone who has been "turned off" by some of the other representations of Jesus in film should see this one, for it dispels the notion of an aesthetic, mysterious, aloof and unreachable Being, portrayed in so many previous versions, and it is much more realistic, being from the NIV verbatim than the "Jesus" movie made for TV recently, in which Jesus comes across as untrue to scripture and almost too playful.
I highly recommend this to anyone who is wondering "Who was/is this God/man, Jesus, anyway?  What did/does He have to say to me?"
Now I want to read The Acts [of the Apostles] by the same film maker!
