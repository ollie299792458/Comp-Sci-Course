Honestly, I cannot understand why anyone could not like this movie.  This has to be my favorite movie of 2003 and I saw Finding Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the Lord of the Rings.
From the reviews of the movie, one would get the idea that it is the worst movie ever made, but in reality, there are a lot worse ones.  Sure, the cast is not made up of big names, but they are still quite talented.  Sean Connery is very good as Quartermein, Jason Flemyng is excellent as Dr. Henry Jekyll, and Stuart Townsend is perfect as Dorian Gray.  Although the latter two are not mega stars like Connery, they are still very talented British stage actors.
Another reason that I like the movie is that the main characters are Mina Harker, Dr. Jekyll (and of course Mr. Hyde), Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man (but not the original one from the Wells book), Dorian Gray, and Tom Sawyer.  With the exception of Sawyer, who I feel was thrown in because they wanted to "American-ize" the movie, the characters in the movie are just like I remembered them from the books they came from.  I read and loved the books "Dracula" (Bram Stoker), "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" (Robert Louis Stevenson), "20000 Leagues Under the Sea" (Jules Verne), "The Invisible Man" (H.G. Wells), "The Picture of Dorian Gray" (Oscar Wilde), and "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" (Mark Twain).  The characters are all what I imagined them to be when I was reading the books, so seeing them on screen is very cool.
In some places the special effects are a little shoddy, but I really didn't mind because I was too busy watching great actors act out great material.  In my opinion, The League of Extrordinary Gentlemen is right up there with The X-men.
Don't let the reviews here scare you off.  Rent it and see for yourself.
