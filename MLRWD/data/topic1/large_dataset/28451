We just watched NAKED CITY on Turner Classics followed by HE WALKED BY NIGHT. Half-way through the latter film, I had to check the cable guide just to make sure that it was actually released the same year as NAKED CITY.

Some consider NAKED CITY groundbreaking but I found it more of a curiosity. From the look and sound of it, producer Mark Hellinger was simply aping Italy's neo realistic genre popularized by movies like OPEN CITY and BICYCLE THIEF (also released in 1948). NAKED CITY's grating non-stop voice over, the casting of Barry Fitzgerald (mugging like a refugee from a John Ford film)and, ultimately, a heavy-handed director, reveal a production that has not aged well. And it suffers badly when viewed in proximity to the likes of HE WALKED BY NIGHT which offers a creepily compelling performance by Richard Basehart as the killer. Scott Brady, Roy Roberts and Jack Webb are absolutely solid as LA cops, coloring their roles with low-keyed authority. NAKED CITY did achieve a genuinely gritty look because of talented folks like DP Bill Daniels, Designer John De Cuir and their respective teams. However, the rest of the film's assets are wasted and don't approach the cool, understated docudrama style of HE WALKED BY NIGHT. Much of that film's effectiveness is now being credited to a young Anthony Mann.

Oddly, HE WALKED BY NIGHT feels more "real" than NAKED CITY's "neo-real". I would think that the latter is of more interest to the film student while HE WALKED BY NIGHT is far more entertaining.
