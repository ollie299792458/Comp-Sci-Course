Dead Ringer was and still is one of my all time favorites, but the more I watch the movie the more I realize that he knew that it was Edith that was going off to be executed. No matter what he could not just stay away. Like the police captain said he was obsessed. He would find stupid reasons to go the the Delorca mansion just to look at her. Then when she pulled that number in the mansion, Don't you know me Jim? He brushed it off then but the damage was already done. He could not get it out of his head, when she was being escorted off to the gas chamer what did he say? She knew when she did it was going to mess with his head, he had to live with the fact that he had signed her death warrant. He would not let go no matter what. He was obsessed. Look at the expression on his face again when she says " I'm Margaret Delorca Sargeant, as you say Edith would have never hurt a fly" It is the way she said it cynically. I believe that he knew at that time it was Edith.
Could be wrong, only my opinion. He probably will go back to the mansion and question everybody there the only one that knew was the Butler and the dog, the girl I believe knew too,
