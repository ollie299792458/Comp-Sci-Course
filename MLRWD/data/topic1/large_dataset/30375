I have trained with p90x and this work out is a better whole body work out. I only have this one dvd so I cant speak for the whole program but this is a great work out. The best part for me is that unlike P90x that makes time slow down and seem like you have been working out forever. Rush fit makes it pass by very fast. I think this is due to the  few and short breaks and u know it is still a great work out when GSP struggles as well. I also end up sweating like I have ran 4 miles by the end of the work out. With that said, I still love P90X but from what I have seen Rushfit is on par with it or better but I will have to get the other videos to see.

OK I have bought the entire program and it did not let me down. I sweat so much and I have lost 10 pounds and 2 pant sizes and only one month in to the program. My goal was to slim down but not lose any muscle mass. I have def slimmed down and go more cut but I thought I wanted to be a little more muscular so I am using 35Lbs weights instead of the recommended 25Lbs and it is working out perfect for me. I also LOVE THE AB WORK OUT!!!. I have played college sports and this program brings me back to those days of great training.
