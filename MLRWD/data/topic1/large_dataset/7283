My five stars speak for themselves. It's a rare film and a favorite. I want to briefly address some of the negative reviews.

1. Everybody is different (thank God), and, thus, everyone will see things differently.
2. Please try to stress that your review is your opinion and not unimpeachable truth.
3. If you're bored, you're boring.
4. Miles desperately wants to get a book published and to get a woman in his life. Jack, well, he has a "plight" that is insufferable and possibly irredeemable, but clearly suffers from it. These are interesting characters with a lot at stake. Which makes for a great story not involving explosions or ghosts. In my opinion.
5. If you find it pretentious or too intellectual or too clever, you are simply lashing out because you don't understand, and that threatens you somehow. Which is okay. Calm down. Breathe. See number 1 above.
6. Hype is a problem. Don't ever believe it. Ask around first. Ask people who aren't just like you so that you may get a different perspective.
7. The worst "review" is the one which cannot separate the film from the characters' action and/or the subject matter. If you abhor the subject matter or the characters, this does not mean it is a poor film. Who liked Humbert Humbert in Lolita? Anyone? Pretty good book though, eh?
