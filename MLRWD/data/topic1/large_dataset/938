A virtual aerial "Lost patrol" as Wayne and his companions are forced to set their plane down in the northern wilderness of Canada in freezing temperatures surrounded by snow in a large uninhabited area. Great cast includes Andy Devine (Stage Coach), Lloyd Nolan (Peyton Place, Ice Station Zebra), James Arness (Gunsmoke) and Harry Carey, Jr. (The Searchers, Rio Grande). This movie is similar to the 60s "Flight of the Phoenix" except that it's not just the crew trying to survive in a severe climate but in this case there is a parallel story of an active and desperate search to find the downed craft is being conducted by a platoon of planes piloted by Devine, Nolan and company. Thus, the movie appears to have twice the action of the excellent and similar film, the Phoenix. It's a desperate attempt to stay alive on the ground while maintaining a weak radio signal while the air is another desperate battle as their comrades try to search beyond their fuel limits in repeated flights to find the lost crew. A very stark movie and this is one of Wayne's best as he plays a slightly more contained role appropriately. There is no stereotyping of characters except men desperately trying to survive while their mates in the sky risk their own lives to find them.
