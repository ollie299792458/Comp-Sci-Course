I've never written a review before, but I felt the need after watching this movie.  I absolutely adored the first installation and found the whole Pride and Prejudice thing cute.  I was told that the second book, The Edge of Reason, was not as good, but still good for laughs.  Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was laugh-out-loud funny with wonderful characters.  I really felt the ties between Bridget and her friends, as well as Bridget and her parents.  I really enjoyed "seeing" into the whacky lives of her friends who were written quite well.  You really got a sense that they were individual people.  I also loved the whole Austen's Persuasion thing with Rebecca and Benwick.  Being a bit slow, I didn't catch on until the party with the accident, but when I got there I was delighted.

Unfortunately, the movie cut all of this out.  The crazy story with her mom and the African dude..GONE.  Everything about her friends and their lives...GONE.  The whole Austen's Persuasion thing...GONE.  And Rebecca's scheming ways..GONE AND TRANSFORMED!  The Thai thing was there, but the sadness of it, the desparation of it, Bridget's time of reflection...GONE.  Its like the movie makers robbed the story of everything that made it "real".  All we were left with was a bit of fluff. Granted, Colin was looking yummy in the fluff, but still, it was just souless, meaningless fluff.  I was so disappointed.
