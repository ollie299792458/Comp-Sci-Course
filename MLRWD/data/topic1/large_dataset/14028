Yossi & Jagger - A review

Yossi & Jagger, an Israeli gay film by Eyten Fox is poignant tale about two Israeli Army officers stationed in a cold far-away area of Israel. While the Israeli Army and Military allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in their services, does not necessarily mean that people are still out and open about their sexuality. We see this in the movie. I was blown away at the depth of the movie. The movie just shows one day in the life of this military unit stationed in the cold hills of Israel. They are warned of an impending ambush attack that night and they spend the day preparing for it. The commander is Yossi. He seems like the typical clean-cut hard-nosed military officer. His second in command is Liom (Jagger), who has the handsomely rock star looks and personality hence his nickname. They explore their love together and struggle with coming to terms of what it really means to be in love and want to share that excitement with the world. Jagger is all for finally getting a queen size bed when they vacation, but Yossi is still stuck in the "I don't know.. maybe pushing together two bed's is still better" attitude. It is only when their love seems doomed does Yossi come around. But is it too late? Will Jagger accept his terms and be happy? I guess you will just have to get the movie like I did and see for yourself.

I rate this movie 4 triangles (out of 5). The movie is slow at times, and its filming is sometimes reminiscent of home video, but that is what makes this tale more touching. Its like a look into the private lives of two men who are falling in love with each other and struggling with a "Don't ask, Don't tell" situation and mentality.

A definite pick to watch!
