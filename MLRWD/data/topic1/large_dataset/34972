Farscape is the most imaginative, creative, and awe-inspiring program I have ever watched.  With the use of only a handful of episodes, I have been able to get anyone hooked on this fantastic program.  The creatures, costumes, sets, and locales featured in the show are examples of how film-quality production can be done on the small screen.
Farscape is the best show on television!  It is the best thing that the Sci-Fi Channel has, has ever had, and probably ever will have!  Farscape is better then the new Star Trek, "Enterprise," and the last two Star Wars films, combined.  For some reason though, (they claim ratings and cost, but it's been the #1 show for them for four years, and advertisers love it), Sci-Fi Channel has just cancelled this wondrous program.
To all Farscape fans:  We must support this program, and help bring back the show.  You can go to savefarscape.com to find out what you can do, and make sure to support the show by buying these DVD's, the video game, t-shirts, posters, etc., to show your appreciation for the series, and to show Sci-Fi that Farscape is their greatest asset, and that it should remain on their programming schedule for years to come!
