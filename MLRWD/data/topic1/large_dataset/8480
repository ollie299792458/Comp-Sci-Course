I have always felt that Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was superfluous and even campy, which is why I was sad to hear that Brian Cox would not accept the role in  "Silence of the Lambs." Nevertheless, I went to see "Red Dragon" this weekend with some friends and I was thoroughly disappointed. In my opinion "Manhunter" is the original "Red Dragon" and for its time a far better product than the new release. Anthony Hopkins is joke in my book, and he completely ruins the movie. He is the complete antithesis of what Harris had in mind for the literary character of the insane Dr Lecter. For those of you who want save some money and see the original "Red Dragon", I suggest that one purchase "Manhunter" before you see "Red Dragon."  The only thing I will say about "Red Dragon" was that the Cinematography was better (obviously due to technological advances in the last fourteen years), and the portrayal of the Red Dragon serial killer was a little better. But at the end of the day give me Brian Cox as Lecter and William Peterson as Agent Graham in "Manhunter" versus Hopkins and Norton in " Red Dragon." Sad to say I love both Hopkins and Norton in other films.
