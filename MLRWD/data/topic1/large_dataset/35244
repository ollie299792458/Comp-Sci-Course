I haven't actually read the book, but went to see the film, not thinking too much of it, because of the immense hype about it. I thought it was brilliant. and have now read the book.
At first my attention was focused on Hugh Grant playing Daniel Cleaver, Grant is so much better in these love rat, charming but dangerous roles..more please! I watched in amazement as i found myself fancying him, i barely gave Mark Darcy (colin firth) a glance, although i did find him a superb actor.
It wasn't until i watched it second time round (it was that good..)that i found i was infatuated by Colin Firth, his potrayal of Mark Darcy was almost perfect, probably helped by playing the origanal Darcy in Pride and prejudice.  I watched in envy as his love for bridget became clear, why couldn't someone love me like that?  The way he looked at bridget, the way he helped her with her TV interview, the support over the blue soup...my heart melted.
But i'm getting so sidetracked over the fabulous firth, back to the film.  Superbly cast, superbly acted and so funny.  You leave wanting to see it again, and i don't know a woman who can't relate to something Bridget does.
I would reccomend it to everyone, men,women, married, singletons...you will all love this film.  I also think that Pride and prejudice fans will especially love this, as it shows Firth playing the character that won the hearts of so many woman (yes, mark darcy and Mr darcy are that similer...he was based on him after all.)
A truly fabulous film.
PS, i also thought Renee Zellweger was really good as Bridget, her accent was top notch, and her acting was terrific.  Although i admit, apart from relating to her, my attention to her was limited...
