In the old days of the so-called"greatest generation" Hollywood used to churn out the sort of John Wayne,god-bless-america,flag-waving propaganda films that were designed to make us proud of who we were and what we represented..This was particularly the case when Hollywood chose to produce a war film...The enemy was always the other guy,and our soldiers,sailors,marines and fliers were always the good guys..Sure,we might have a few cowards or bad apples in the bunch but overall we represented freedom,justice and the proverbial"american way"...
  ..All that has changed and"In the valley of elah"is a prime example of this change..Instead of portraying our guys as the proverbial good guys this film paints a portrait of sadism,cruelty,drug addiction,fear and wanton,unnecessary violence,and all of that alledgedly represents who and what our military have become...
As a propaganda film smearing the military and,at the same time making a low-key statement about who we are and what we are doing in Iraq "In the valley of elah" has been praised by the same elements within both the film industry and those paid to critique and review films for the public..
..but in the end it is a propaganda film and little else,in that it takes what at the begining of the film it identifies as"actual events"and extrapolates them into a narrow and self-serving statement designed to cheapen those who serve while questioning why they do so...
While I personally cannot claim to support the Iraq war neither do I view our military as the wantonly sadistic,confused,lowlife bottom-feeders that this film has painted them to be...
One can only wonder why Hollywood cannot make a war-oriented film that is neither a flag-waving pie-in-the-sky pile of flapdoodle or a negative assault of who we are and everything we stand for?
