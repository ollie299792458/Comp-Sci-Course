This movie is more of a cell phone ad than anything else. In fact, when I first saw the trailers, I thought it WAS a cell phone ad. Kim Basinger promoting cell phones, cool. Turns out this is an actual movie. Brought to us by the same writer, Larry Cohen, who also collaborated on the 2003 film, Phone Booth with Colin Farrell. Seems that a lot of reviews that I've read are comparing the 2 films, and I have to say that I definitely liked that one better.

This movie is very simplistic, the characters are simple, the plot is simple, but everything is believeable. The most entertaining part of watching this movie is waiting to see what will happen next. What predicaments Ryan will encounter (like running low on battery) as he races to rescue Jessica and her family (btw, the son's name is Ricky Martin... ha!).

Treat this movie as one big cellular phone ad and you won't be disappointed. You'll be astonished at the number of different ways in which a cell phone can be made to function.
