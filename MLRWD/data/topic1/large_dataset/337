Along with This Is Spinal Tap and the more recent Election, Cable Guy is one of the most original movies of the late 20C. In scene after scene it somehow manages to be both wild and controlled, hitting the sweet spot of  the absurd: the bizzare Karaoke party and aftermath, the riotous Medieval  Times/Star Trek evening, and even the too-edgy-for-some restaurant bathroom  humiliation scene.The pacing and characterization are excellent as is the  acting of the two main protagonists; Carry gives the performance of his  career (it's hard to imagine anyone else being anything like as good in the  role) and straight man Matthew Broderick (so underrated) is the perfect  foil.
The film flopped with Carry's hard core fans - and others - because  of the low expectations inherent in such an audience. The average movie  goer is in search of comfort and distraction - bite sized pieces of  mediocrity to chomp down with his popcorn.I read a piece by a Carrey fan a  week or so ago who picked his favorite moments from the actor. He hated CG  of course but choose one scene he did like: it was the movies one off-key  note, the Porno Password scene!
