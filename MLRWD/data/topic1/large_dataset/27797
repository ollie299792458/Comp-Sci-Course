Citizen Kane, like all brilliant movies, was never designed to be entertaining. One of the things it could be designed to be is a big message, a headline in one of Kanes newspapers even. The headline reads: America is powerful, and power corrupts. Kane could represent America, a country that was given great power, from another. The country hoped to enlighten those of the underprivileged and bring liberty to all. The country hoped to have fun and was innocent and nice to all the other countries. As America became more and more powerful though, it began to  care only about itself. America now foolishly views itself as the greatest nation of them all now. America thinks that it can control everything, and forced the other countries to love itself, two of them are Russia and Vietnam. When these countries do not agree to love him, we retreat to our material world and die cold and lonely, forgetting Americas youth of love and happiness. I know im starting to ramble, but the point is, Citizen Kane has not one message or theme, but many. It's a brilliant movie that shouldn't be watched because its entertaining or dramatic or whatever, It should be watched because it's art. I would even argue that if you classified Citizen Kane under one genre it would have to be a comedy, with the joke on America, and our sick twisted ways of valuing money and material over anything else.
