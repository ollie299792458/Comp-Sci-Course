Well the fifth movie is now out in its own special edition and thats as it should  be--I dont dislike the movie as much as others do because A) I am a Star Trek fan B) the original series and its characters are still and always will be the best, and C) I saw ST V in the old Fox Theater where as a kid I delighted to other Trek films, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Empire Strikes Back (The theater no longer exists).
My only problem with it was the thing about Sybok being Spocks half brother--Now that was just stupid--They could have not had that part in there and instead made Sybok and old friend (or even foe) from Spocks childhood--The impact would have been the same....
I think they tried to keep the humor that the fourth film had and no one realized that it wouldnt really work because of the nature of the script--And people quit bagging on Shatner's direction please--He did good with what he had to work with and dont give me this nonsense about him directed because of his ego--Look at the two films directed by Frakes, First Contact which was good, and Innsurection which wasnt all that much--So how can you call one move good for its direction when the next one wasnt??--I am rambling now--In any case this isnt a bad movie, and if you are a Trek fan as I am it is essential to own for your DVD collection....
I have more problems with Star Trek VI--so I will wait till that one comes out then you will really see me vent....
