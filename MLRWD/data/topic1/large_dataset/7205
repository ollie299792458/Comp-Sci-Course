'The African Queen' is a truly classic film, with two of the greatest stars ever put on screen-Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. Why Warner Brothers hasn't released it on DVD by now is beyond me. Enter your e-mail on the sign-up list to finally get this wonderful gem the credit it deserves. This movie belongs among Warner Brothers' numerous two-disc special editions, some of which are far less worthy than 'The African Queen'-I mean 'The Bodyguard'? seriously. It may be an okay film, but it holds no candle to the 1951 treasure.

The film was nominated for four Academy Awards-best actor (also won-Bogart), best actress (Hepburn, of course), director John Huston, and screenplay by Huston and James Agee. (It's one of the most obvious choices for Best Picture that wasn't nominated. A Place in the Sun, An American in Paris, and A Streetcar Named Desire all earned their spots rightfully, but the Academy overlooking this classic is a true misjudgment.) The film ranked 17th on the American Film Institute's list of greatest American films of all time, (and 14th on greatest love stories) with the two stars topping AFI's list of greatest screen legends. Both of their performances are excellent, and Huston weaves a terrific journey down a river in hot, humid Africa. It combines love and adventure flawlessly-if you haven't seen it, I recommend it highly. It has excitement, comedy, a wonderful pair, great direction, a beautiful setting, leaches, and Kate telling Bogie "Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are put in this world to rise above." It's a huge oversight by now that the movie remains in the vault of dusty vhs movies. Sign up now!
