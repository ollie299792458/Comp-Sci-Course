The movie is good. This review is about the transfer to HD.

Sometimes the picture looks great and are obviously HD, but other times it's just plain ugly and DVD quality or less.

This is very obvious (i'm not a videophile, just an ordinary guy with money to blow on blu-ray) because the quality changes many times during a single scene, changing based on the camera angle.

So you end up with a shot of will smith that looks awesome, and then suddenly there's a shot of someone else that looks terrible, then it's back to will smith and looking good, then the camera changes back to the horrible looking image.

It's still better than the DVD, but it's not what it could or should be.

It's a shame that the movie is not up to par because the early adopters of this technology are the least price sensitive, but the most likely to notice poor quality.

Go ahead and charge a fortune for the movies, but at least make them the best possible. Sadly, the high price combined with the poor HD transfer make the offerings unattractive to both the early adopters as well as more general consumers.

There's a decent chance a Sony exec of some kind will read this, and if so, I hope you have the cajones to do what it takes to make your media platform a success. You will ultimately fail if you can't deliver on the promise.
