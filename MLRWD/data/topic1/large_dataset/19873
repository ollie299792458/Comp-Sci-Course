This is a wonderful piece that brings the period -and the man- vividly to life. My 17-year-old daughter joined me in anxiously awaiting each installment, for which I expressly ordered HBO. I have only two minor complaints, which I will address further below.  The portrayals were superbly acted, and the entire piece contained subtlety & restraint while giving the viewer plenty to "chew on". Each evocative scene unfolded with nuance & earthy context, formed by realistic dialogue. There was some use of edgy cinematography, with unexpected angles and tight -often off-center- closeups, but the effect usually works well. It forces the eye onto a new detail.

The conflicting emotions of this very real man can actually be supposed through these reenactments. I love that Mr McCullough's book was the basis for this adaption. His finely wrought depiction of a world turned upside down for Adams and the surrounding subjects is so realistic as to be stepped into, and this beautifully-made film does it justice. The locations and realism in living conditions are not to be missed.

The two overlooked areas of this project that were somewhat distracting:
It was sometimes difficult to know how much time had passed or where a scene was taking place. The aging of characters occasionally seemed inconsistent -most noticeably with the children. A simple caption introducing a location or year would have been appreciated. Still, these flaws do not prevent my rating this with 5 stars. We need more like this.

While not a blockbuster-mentality offering, I do feel that a viewer who has some interest in history, visually stunning scenery, and a decent vocabulary will find this biopic riveting. The tension and plot of human condition is palpable throughout. No car(riage) chase scenes necessary.
