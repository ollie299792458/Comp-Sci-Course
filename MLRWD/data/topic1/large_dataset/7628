Family Guy only had a three season run (I think after a year of silence it's safe to say there won't be anymore).  These two DVDs make up over half of the 50 episodes in the series.  Despite what you may have heard, these 28 episodes entail every episode that aired in the first two seasons.  Because of Season 1's late start, a lot of season 1 episodes were pushed into season 2, which in turn pushed some season 2 episodes into season 3.
The series starts of very strong for a first-time viewer.  The episodes are packed tight with jokes and often go off on wild tangents.  The early stories are a little weak, but they pick up in the second season where the series gets even more creative.  Definately something that keeps getting better through the second season.  The third season was a little weaker, so if you were only getting one of the two sets, I'd recommend this one.
If you've never seen Family Guy, then be warned: it's not for everyone.  It's got crude humour, and isn't afraid to poke fun at just about anything, despite what popular opinion might be.
The DVD set also comes at a relatively cheap price, considering you're getting 28 episodes of Family Guy goodness.  The third season set would most likely entail the other 21 episodes (22 if they include the unaired "When You Wish Upon a Weinstein") and thus in two purchases you can have all of Family Guy.
