This, in my opinion, is James Cameron's best (and regularly underappreciated) film. Of course, I am by no means a James Cameron fan, so take it for what it's worth. I think he's a competant Hollywood director,  but that only means that he makes better trash than his contemporaries.  Still, The Abyss is a personal favorite of mine somehow. It isn't perfect,  and certainly is a bit slow at times, but these things don't bother me at  all. The slow pacing and the careful development of the circumstances which  lead to all of the action later into the film are what I credit the movie  for, actually. And as a whole, it really is quite a unique movie, with some  very wonderful and even genuinely gripping moments. In any case, I do NOT  feel the same way about the Director's Cut, which is appallingly bad. I  looked forward to the additional footage but quickly realized what a wise  move it was to have it removed before theatrical release. It took the odd,  engaging, escapist film I knew and loved and turned it into a silly,  stomach-turning, 3-hour sermon; the last half-hour, which although  ambiguous in the original version was very satisfying to me on a number of  levels, is now atrociously cheesy and utterly ruined. Avoid the Director's  Cut.
