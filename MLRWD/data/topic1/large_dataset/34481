I purchased this after waiting for it to show up in my mailbox from netflix. I waited for 8 or so months, that's how popular this dvd is on netflix, so i knew i had to buy it. Well folks this is the real deal, a worthy addition to any dvd library. The kung fu is very good, the hero someone you can learn from, and his journey masterful.

The fact that the first hour of this film is dedicated to his journey and learning speaks wonders why this kung fu movie trounces most others, especially any made in the last 15 years (kill bill is probably closest in execution).

I watched this with the commentary running (featuring RZA and a film critic from i forget where) and it was a great listen. RZA knows his stuff, and actually knew more about the history of kung fu and asian culture than the critic. Both got along well, and little nuggets of info are brought to the attention of the listener. If you are interested in wutang or RZA it is also worthy, as you learn about RZA growing up in staton island watching these films and how important kung fu movies were to hip hop and black culture.

While the dvd is a little costly, (since most dvds this old an be purchased for 10 bucks on amazon) it's well worth the  price. I own somewhere around 90 dvds, and probably only rewatch about 10 of them. This is a great addition to that ten.
