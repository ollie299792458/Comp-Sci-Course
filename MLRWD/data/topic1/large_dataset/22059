Unfortunately, the producers of this DVD set decided to refry (edit) classic television in order to save a few pennies - to keep this set down to three DVDs, rather than four.  Yet, they included a promo for the animated series?  Shameless.  For this reason, I can give the set no more than four stars.  
Curiously, I must also mention that the labeling on the DVDs is incorrect.  The last episode listed on the back of the case for Disc 1 is actually the first episode on Disc 2.  Also, what the case says should be Disc 2's first episode is actually Disc 1's last.  Shoddy production work - but not necessarily worth a rating reduction.
But, that said, Mr. Bean is still wonderfully funny, and I have found the DVDs to be wildly entertaining.  My six year old daughter is now a big fan, and I was amazed at how much my three year old enjoyed Rowan Atkinson's physical comedy.  Mr. Bean is good, clean "G" rated fun that the whole family can enjoy.  This set is a far better alternative to the single disc "highlights" DVD that had been available before.
Having watched the entire set, I do feel satisfied with my purchase.  However, I would have been very willing to pay more for a fourth DVD in the set, so that ALL of Mr. Bean's priceless routines could be enjoyed in their original state.
