This documentary attests to the fact that persons of All political stripes can cooperate on occasions when authority arrogates power through lies, deceit and pettiness. The Free Speech movement of the early sixties apparently tied together a coalition ranging from Goldwater Republicans to liberal Marxists to thrawt a university administration that didn't merit its authority. Meanwhile, the documentary does proffer considerable support for the premise that a substantial contingent of the anti-war movement of the late sixties did itself arrogate authority through its priviledged status in society to browbeat those whose worldview on the righteousness of that admittedly hideous war markedly differed from their own. Also represented in this documentary are the fledgling black power and women's movement of that era though no mention is made of the movement for gay tolerance and acceptance which saw its first public demonstration outside the White House in the middle sixties by then government workers. I do have the impression still that gay rights activists were met with some of the same derision by the New Left as that spouted on many of those who chose to fight in Vietnam.
