One of the greatest movies of all time. It's impact on our culture has been tremendous. Just take a look at AFI's list of all time great films. It's number 2. Or the other lists like movies quotes or movie songs.

The movie is first rate and gripping. No matter how many times I see it the film sweeps me up in its story. And I still laugh out loud in the scene at Rick's Cafe when Claude Rains blows his whistle and says "I'm shocked shocked to find that there is gambling here." A moment later he's handed his winnings. I could go on with other favorite moments: the flash back scenes in Paris, the desperate attempt by Victor to obtain the letters of transit while outsmarting the Nazis. Needless to say each scene in the movie is a gem.

But I think the story had a deeper meaning. Like A Watch on the Rhine, Casablanca makes the case that America can no longer sit on the sidelines while all hell is breaking out in the rest of the world. And like Rick, America must make up its mind which side to support.

Having said all that, it also is one damn good love story.

As to the DVD itself, it is first rate. The restoration is incredible. If I didn't know the movie was over 60 years old, I'd swear it was done recently and the producers decided to film in black and white for effect. That's how good the quality of the film is. There are hours of extras: a couple of commentaries on the movie itself, two documentaries both narrated by Lauren Bacall, and best of all a radio broadcast with the three major stars reprising their roles.

So instead of spending ten dollars a piece on going out to the movies and seeing a piece of junk, go to your local drug store get some microwave popcorn and snowcaps and pop in the Casablanca DVD and see and experience what a real movie should be. Trust me you won't be sorry.
