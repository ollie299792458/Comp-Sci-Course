Of course, for the been there done that drugs and alcohol crowd the film rocks, but beyond that it's truly an outstanding film -- something that  we've lost since the era when Hollywood could be counted on to put out  strong products. Interestingly, the film to which I see many compare this  -- and to which it's definitely comparable -- is "American  Graffiti," a film which came out during that era. What I love about  the film is that, like the Lucas film, it doesn't place any characters  above the others, it memorably recreates an era, and Linklater is able to  garner strong performances from all of his characters -- similar to,  believe it or not, the best Altman work and, by 90's extension, Paul Thomas  Anderson of "Boogie Nights" and "Magnolia" fame.
Like  the best film work, this movie also does contain, contrary to what many  seem to notice, issues of significance. It shows a time when people are  definitely "Dazed and Confused" and searching for an identity,  and the ability to make sense of the world and issues around us, regardless  of how far we may become removed from the concerns of our youth as time and  different responsibilities encroach on our thinking -- and by extension,  our ability to truly think. If you don't believe me, think of Wooderson  (the only post high school character who has a legitimate connection with  the others) and this paraphrased quote: And the older you get, the more  sh*t you're going to have to deal with. Pink having to sign his pledge is  only a prelude to the adult world; for as us older reviewers know, the  Coach Conrads are only too common in the world. Finally, keeping in line  with the pedantic nature of this review, my favorite part of the film is  the final shot: For the first time in the film we have an overhead shot of  the action -- we've been on an equal footing with the characters the whole  time, seeing them from eye level, but now we can look down and show that we  know what Linklater knows, the ride's uphill the rest of the way and as  much as we think we may be ready or prepared we don't know what's on the  other side. Look out the windshield shot and you'll see it's uphill: what  was once life in the fast lane becomes a slow ride.
