I actually rented the director's cut once and it's shocking how different the movie was.  This version is one of my favorite films.  The timing, the pacing, though a bit slow at times, the sets, Kris Kristofferson, Mel's former partner and especially James Coburn in an outstanding cheerful bad guy role near the end of his life, all are just excellent parts of the movie plus the Chinese bad guys.  My favorite is how Mel is stone tough.  The scene of torment near the end of the movie is cut in half on TV while the dvd of course has it all and it makes a big difference I think.  Mel's done a lot of movies but this one just rings right, a bad guy who isn't just all bad and has a love interest that actually makes some sense.  "Then what good are you?" one of the snappiest lines in a movie.  I use it in real life sometimes but it's in such a brutal context I try to make it clear I just like the flippancy of it in a severe setting.  Yes, I'm trying hard to not give away any points in the movie if you happen to not yet have seen it.  I've probably watched this film half a dozen times and may watch it, God willing, another half dozen over the year.  I love his solution with when he is stalked both on the street and in his apartment, just fantastic stuff.  Enjoy yourself.
