Having not read any extensive reviews prior to seeing this movie, I went in a little blind - so I was pretty surprised that the story was basically a prequel to the kind of Robin Hood stories we all think of when we hear that name. While most Robin Hood media focus on his time in Sherwood Forest tormenting the Sheriff of Nottingham with his steal-from-the-rich antics, this movie actually tells the tale of how Robin Longstride, a common archer in the King's army, eventually became the outlaw known as Robin Hood. Disappointingly, they never really say how he managed to become such an incredible archer. He already seems to have mastered that art before the start of the movie. The screenplays & special effects of some of his shots are quite nice, however. I really enjoyed the way Ridley Scott worked hard to keep historical accuracy present in this movie while preserving key elements of the Robin Hood tale. As you progress through the historical elements of the story (Richard the Lionheart sacking castles & eventually dying; King John's greedy rule), Robin's personal story leads him to meet people like Little John, Friar Tuck, Marian, and several other familiar names. The movie was terrifically cast, gorgeously costumed and designed, and overall very enjoyable to watch.

In short, I'd say it was one of the more underrated movies of its year, and it deserved way more credit than it got!
