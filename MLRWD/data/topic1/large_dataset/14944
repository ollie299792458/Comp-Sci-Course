Having the mentality of most people who find out one of their favorite films is being remade (a recent blow to the stomach came in the form of the annoucement of an Ikiru, American, remake,) I had no interest in seeing this film.  Top that off with the fact that I think High Tension was one of the worst films I'd seen in recent years, my want to see The Hills Have Eyes barely existed.

But the more I thought about it, the more my interest peaked.  Craven himself handpicked Aja to remake his cult classic, and Craven being one of my favorite horror directors (I can forgive the man for the last, say, 12 years of his career because he made Last House on the Left, the Hills Have Eyes, the Serpent and the Rainbow and Nightmare on Elm Street.) I ended up giving his choice the benefit of the doubt.

The remake, although a great piece of unsettling horror, does have some major flaws.  One, and, for me, the one that stood out the most, was the music.  Holy s*it, why does a horror film, one that's supposed to be at least semi-realistic, need some pseudoheroic Michael Bay-film soundtrack?  Why not just use the soundtrack naturally created by the landscape?  The other part I have to spit some venom at is the, obviously studio forced, tacked on happy "family reunion" ending.  That's one of the things I adore about the original, he got his child back and it ended.  In Aja's remake the film is pointlessly drawn out with an extra 5-6 minutes of the family's recovergence.

Other than those two complaints, I can safely say that I was absolutely, albeit pleasently, shocked to find myself on the positive end of the spectrum once the film came to a close.

And 10 cool points to Aja for the Straw Dogs picking-up-the-broken-glasses-and-putting-them-back-on-during-a-raid reference.
