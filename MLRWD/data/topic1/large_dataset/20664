I am a sucker for kung fu movies so my assessment of how surprisingly good this movie is, would be less helpful than that of my two friends. Both are usually adamantly against martial arts movies on the premise that they are usually "cheesy" and/or "unrealistic". I knew I could soften them up if I could convince them to give this film a chance. Once they submitted and pretended not be enduring it, they quickly surrendered that it was "surprisingly good" and "really entertaining". That's the great thing about Stephan Chow; he makes his movies so unrealistic and overdone that you don't ever try to take them seriously; they are just plain ol' entertaining. His films and this one in particular seem to be a perfect hybrid of martial arts, comedy, and fantasy and comic book movies. This movie is not realistic, it is surreal, in a good way, the action scenes are fast, furious and Kung Fu...nny as heck. If you love martial arts or kung fu movies this is a MUST add to your collection, if you are not into them as much, this will be the one film in the genre that will knock your socks off guaranteed! This Axe-Kickin' Edition really kicks AXE minus the "xe" and add "ss".
