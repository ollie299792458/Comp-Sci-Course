I first saw the movie King Solomon's Mines in 1954. I was 14 and lived in a very small town so movies were our big entertainment. It was radio and not TV at home. A movie like this one was a real treat. Stewart Granger is impressive as the great white hunter Allan Quartermain hired by Debra Kerr, the beautiful cool English woman. She is searching for her husband who is missing and presumed dead. The African location is marvelous and the fantastic footage of masses of wild animals on the move and fierce spear throwing natives makes for dangerous situations. Granger and Kerr soon find themselves attracted to each other and must fight temptation. To add to the adventures is the fabled treasure of King Solomon's Mines that her husband was searching for when he disappeared. Granger just happens to have an old treasure map showing the location of the diamond mines. They travel deeper into the unknown, their native bearers flee in fear and they encounter very unfriendly tribes.
 This movie won Cinematography awards and the extra footage was used in later movies. I bought this dvd movie recently from Amazon and wondered if I would still like it and yes I do. The footage of Africa is so impressive. I think this is a good movie and worth buying. You've got to find out how it ends, right?
  Sir H. Rider Haggard published the book in 1885 and is the basis of the movies. Allan Quaterman is the Victorian adventurer in the book.
