I'm inspired to write this review after reading "Slick Jimmy's" review of this film/DVD.

Let's get something out of the way first and foremost:  We're never all going to agree on what's a good movie.

I think the bottom line for all of us is whether or not a movie speaks to us as individuals.  Next, does the movie speak the truth?  Does it accurately reflect the way life really is and enlighten us to what we need to hear?

I saw "Brazil" at a time when I worked for the government and was in love with the Goddess of my dreams, whom I pursued even thought she was engaged to another.  It was a romantic time for me, and this film reflected a lot of what I was going through in my life.  So, yes, I could relate to it.

And on top of all that, I thought it was incredibly well produced, well cast, and funny as hell!  :-)  I loved this movie.

Some have called it depressing but Sam Lowry led, in a way, a charmed life.  Okay, so it ends in death (perhaps?), but what about all the adventurous stuff that happened along the way?  Meeting, and making love to, the girl of his dreams?  Becoming the super hero that he'd long been dreaming about?  That's pretty cool stuff!

Also, has anyone noticed how rare it is to find somebody who accurately predicts the future?  I can find no better cinematic prognostication than "Brazil"!!!!!!

Terry Gilliam successfully predicted the Internet, watching the Internet at work, and the ever growing influence of terrorism, and government control out of fear, in our everyday lives.

In hindsight, he saw our future life pretty clearly.

This movie was Gilliam's masterwork.  I hope he still has a few more masterpieces in him.
