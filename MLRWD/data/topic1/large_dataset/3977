Just as most other reviewers have said, this movie is a 'watch over and over again' classic!
We have owned 2 videos and wore both out; time to buy the dvd after several years of not owning this movie. Prior to owning, we used to rent it over and over again at the independent theater in san francisco, in the late 90's. And were told we were not the only ones to do so. This movie was so quotable [I remember co-workers doing so back in the early 90's, when it first came out] from the get-go, and still is. 'Head. Pants. Now'. in that Scottish accent-hilarious.

And, in addition to the mentioned scenes with Phil Hartman, Anthony P., Alan Arkin, etc., I'll add cameo scenes with Steven Wright AND Charles Grodin. How can you not love the campy cheese fest of this film? And the gal who plays Nancy Travis' sister? She's a gem, too.

The best. And love the beatnik references and caricatures-if you love SFO, you will love this movie-set in SFO and references the beatnik poet hip scene. It's also a parody of the horror flicks-but is not gory or scary in that regard....just some parody of the genre, and of the 'oops mishaps' that bring nearly every romantic comedy to a conclusion. Love it!

Oh, and it's totally unrealistic-it's set in SFO, but in no way representative of real life or actual SFO. But this is part of it's charm.

My spouse and I to this day have dozens of inside joke lines from this movie. Quotable, like I said.
