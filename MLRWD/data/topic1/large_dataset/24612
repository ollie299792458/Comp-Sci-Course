I am extremely disappointed in the way that the history of the WWE title was presented. The personalities of the 70's, 80's and 90's are so much different and would have made this more colorful if we had guys like Mean Gene, Jesse Ventura, Jerry Lawler etc speaking on this subject other than the 'ol Bore J.R. To me he is NOT the face of WWE nor does he present the matches that well. The segment changes are choppy too. Im 28 years old and have probably seen alot of these matches 10 or more times anyway, but I would have liked to have seen better timeline segements from each title change and the storylines that embodied them. To be honest this should have been a six disc set with full length matches as provided but GIVE us more to sink our teeth into! The HISTORY of the Championship os misleading. This is the showcasing of the most popular matches over the years with TOO MUCH MISSING IN BETWEEN! For example I think what made Shawn Michaels so great was his charisma and rivalries. What made Hogan great was his behind the curtain friendships (not real life friendships, but his storyline friendships) like Hacksaw, Tugboat, Macho Man, Warrior, and others that he stood up for along with USA. You don't get the personal touch on this, its  real cut and dry...and by DRY did I mention J.R. babbles between the matches? To me J.R. will always be that WCW southern bore. I loved Monsoons technical speak, Bobby Heenans wisecracks, Venturas brutal truth. To me McMahon and J.R. were the worst commentators, with the exception of J.R.'s "STONE COLD!!! STONE COLD!! STONE COLD!!! Rent it, don't buy. This sucks!
