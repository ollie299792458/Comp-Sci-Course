I originally saw this film at a festival and I found it to be quite surprising.  In spite of its title, it is not an attack on Michael Moore.  While it uses a Roger and Me type of device to tie the elements together, the film focuses on the challenge of maintaining truth and avoiding manipulating images and facts to make a point.  The film certainly highlights many of the distortions in Moore's movies, but that is not the primary emphasis.  Wilson examines his own desire to get certain images and the tempations to be less than honest in achieving that aim.  To his credit, he always corrects these errors before moving on.  The section with Penn Gillette is well worth the price of admission.  He examines the nature of Bull$%#@ in different forms of media and discusses the difficulty in portraying facts with distorting them.  If you are able to set aside your political bias and fawning worship of Moore, I think that you will find this film to be an entertaining look at the documentary genre and Moore in particular.  Along the way, you will also get a healthy dose of the optimism that makes America the great country that it is.
