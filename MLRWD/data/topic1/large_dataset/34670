This documentary hits the viewer like a sledgehammer to the side of the face. Its a very personal depiction of life under occupation and sets a case for the day to day struggles of the 'occupied' in the Gaza strip. The story line follows a couple of young local children and takes in their points of view.. and there is most certainly a grim portrayal of life and paints a very grim future for them. Furthermore, the documentary brings to light a range of very very serious allegations against the Israeli 'occupiers' that deserves further investigation including: the use of nerve gas on civilians; the intentional targeting of civilians; collective punishment by way of road blocks etc; and the prevention of humanitarian resources (such as ambulances and medical aid) from getting to civilian victims..and the list goes on. These are definitely crimes against all known forms of international law and human rights conventions. It is also not hard to imagine why hence the director draws heavy criticism from various groups on the Israeli side as to the impartiality of the movie. Nonetheless, this reviewer can certainly understand that there is no way to sugar-coat such issues and they must be dealt with openly. In conclusion it is my humble opinion that this documentary brings to the Israel-Palestine debate a very valuable input. 5 stars.
