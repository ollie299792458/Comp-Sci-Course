Loosely based on both the original Washington Irving story as well as the Disney version, Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow takes a revisionist approach and ends up with a genuine horror classic.  Johnny Depp stars as  "Constable" Ichabod Crane, an 18th century detective keen on  using scientific methods (unheard of in this period) to solve crimes.  Annoyed by his unconventional methods, Magistrate Christopher Lee sends  Depp upstate to Sleepy Hollow to investigate a string of grisly  murders-by-beheading.  Depp/Crane becomes involved in a supernatural  situation that tests his lack of faith (a sub-plot resulting from a  childhood trauma involving his mother [Lisa Marie] and sinister father) and  makes him a full witness to the goulish decapitations.  Christopher Walken  is absolutely frightening as the horseman, and Christina Ricci and a cast  of classic British actors flesh (pardon the pun) out the story with hints  of shady business among the town's statesmen.  The commentary by Burton is  fairly optional, but the "making of" and other features enhance  the movie superbly.  Burton uses a foggy, bleached style to enhance the  appearance and tone of the movie, creating a genuinely unique vision.  Be  warned, though - there's lots of loppings in this flick, so it's definitely  not for the squeamish.  With homage to Hammer horror films but otherwise  unique in the genre, Sleepy Hollow should easily take its place among other  groundbreaking horror movies like The Shining or An American Werewolf in  London.
