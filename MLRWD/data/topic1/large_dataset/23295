This is, in my opinion, the best comedy of all time. It's consistently funny and also has moments that can bring a tear to your eyes.
The cast is great and the acting is top notch. The last time I watched was when it first aired and the occasional rerun. I hate watching reruns unless I watch from episode one so I waited patiently for it to become available on DVD. I guess I can't claim to be an expert on the show and I didn't buy the individual seasons since I was waiting for the prices to drop. When I saw this all in one, I thought it was a good opportunity to get the whole set. I agree with other reviewers that this is very cheap packaging. I don't like the menus and the picture quality is not befitting such a great show, it definitely deserves better treatment. One of the discs also had a circular defect on the printed side. I don't remember every scene or the mid-season specials but they should have been included and the episodes should have been left intact, shame on Sony!! I am still happy I bought the set as the laughs were well worth it.
