It's hard to review a movie as great as Forrest Gump in just one review.  Tom Hanks does a great job like always and Forrest Gump is right up there with the best of the movies.  It's a drama, comedy, and biographical movie  all wrapped into one.  Of course it's funny to hear Forrest Gump talk and  living in the South I've heard that name probably more than any of them  when it comes to how we southerners talk.  But the best thing about the  movie is that it tells a great story and has a lot of good drama in it.  Forrest Gump learned to be one of the greats in the Armed Forces and found  out that he was also one of the fastest runners of all which earned him a  starting place on a football team.  He also follows Jenny (the girl he grew  up with) where ever she goes and ends up being with her at the end of the  movie after finding out they have a son together.  
There's not many  movies that are better all-around or that has as many charms as this movie.  I taped it the first chance I got and I haven't watched it in a couple of  years, but I still remember just about everything about it.  Forrest Gump  is one movie you will never forget.  Just saying that it's worth buying is  the least I can say.
