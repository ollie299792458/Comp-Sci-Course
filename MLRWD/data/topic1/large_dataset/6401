This beautiful Merchant/Ivory film is now available on a two disc dvd set. Disc one presents the film itself in a stellar transfer. As with most M/I films, the cinematagraphy is breathtaking with many scenes filmed in the fall at King's College and Trinity College. The score by Richard Robbins is one of the most beautiful ever created for a film and it is outrageous that it was overlooked for an Oscar nomination. The acting is also superb with a pre-stardom Hugh Grant as the staunchly repressed Clive Durham, James Wilby as the title character, Rupert Graves as the hunky garden boy Scudder and Ben Kingsley in a humourous turn as Maurice's psychiatrist.
Disc Two contains a 30 minute documentary "The Story of Maurice" which features interviews with screenwriter Kit Hesketh-Harvey, directors James Ivory and Ishmail Merchant and actors Hugh Grant, James Wilby and Rupert Graves. Their conversations are very enlightening especially the actors recalling their research and motivation into their roles and the responses they received after the film opened (for some strange reason Japanese school girls were crazy about them!). "Conversations with the Film Makers" contains another 13 minutes of interviews. Thirty minutes of twelve deleted scenes and alternative scenes are included. This includes a different opening preface to the film and another character that ended up being cut from the film.
This beautiful dvd set (the art work alone is gorgeous) is worthy of any dvd library and a must for fans of the Merchant/Ivory films.
