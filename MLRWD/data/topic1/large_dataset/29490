I would give 5 stars if this DVD had better menu options to skip over the excessive "talky" bits.

That being said ... for beginners ... Ariellah does a great job explaining proper mechanics for each movement.  You will really understand the movement and how to use your body.  The downside is that if you already know movement mechanics ... you will be crying from boredom.

This DVD is by no means dumbed-down just b/c it is best for beginners.  If you can follow to the end, you will learn some advanced movement and choreography.  As an advanced dancer, I have to do something else while practicing with this DVD.  Drill a move, then wash a few dishes while she explains body mechanics I already know, tear off the rubber gloves and run back to the computer to drill the move I don't alrady know, repeat.  So I work-out and get the house clean at the same time.

A better menu to "cherry-pick" the advanced moves from the beginner explanations and body-mechanics drills would have made this 5 stars.

This DVD is great to learn body mechanics.  For more advanced fare & less talk, I recommend Anasama or Elisheva.

Happy Dancing!
