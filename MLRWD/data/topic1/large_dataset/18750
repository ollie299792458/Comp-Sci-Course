Can't say enough about this movie. I remember seeing it when first shown on television in
the early 70's. 'Duel' is an early, suspense-filled masterpiece of filmmaking by Spielberg
and shows the burgeoning genius that his subsequent work would fully exhibit. This film has all the
trademarks of a Hitchcock film (which is fitting since Hitch as it turns out was one of
Spielberg's idols). The mysterious, unseen menacing truck driver, the creepy randomness of
the attack (envision 'The Birds') etc etc. Dennis Weaver does a brilliant portrayal of a victim
trying in vain to figure out the motive for a truck driver's murderous rage toward him while at the
same time just trying to survive the ordeal itself. As he contemplates in the cafe restroom: "You just
go along thinking some things never change, like being able to drive on a public highway without
someone trying to murder you...the ropes that have kept you hanging in there have all been cut loose,
and there you are, right back in the jungle again." Weaver was in his late 40's when this was made
and it's amazing that he did most if not all of his own stunts and these were extremely dangerous
like the close call with the phone booth attack ("I'd like to report a truck driver that's been
endangering my life..") Perhaps most notable is how many scenes are at one time both terrifying
and hilarious, like the extreme closeups of Weaver screaming hysterically while the truck moves in
for the kill. Most amazing is how a movie this good was filmed in only 10 days. Buy this and enjoy
every minute!
