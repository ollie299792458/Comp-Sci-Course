Yes, this movie did poorly at the box office.  No, it is not a stinker.  This is one of the best movies I've ever had the pleasure to see [and this is coming from a fan of the comic books].  What truly seperates this movie from the rest is how it spent it's budget.  Rather than buying the greatest CGI effect and using them to death, they instead hire a great cast and crew along with well done props.  Another spectacular thing about this film is the directing.  Rather than givng you chaotic action sequences and horrible puns, they use one cut action scenes and actual focus on the plot.  Naturally Sean Connery is the star but you have some other great actors including Shane West as Secret agent Tom Sawyer [yes secret agent Sawyer].  In the movie Alan Quartermain [Sean Connery] leads a band of heroes from victorian novels [including Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo and Mina Murray] against a villan named "Fantom" [yes that's how it's spelled] to prevent a world war.  This plot is not only easy to understand but is actually enjoying to watch.  However, what truly makes this movie spectacular is that instead of trying to use the plot from the comic books they come up with their own.  Of course not everyone is going to enjoy this movie.  There are some problems like how can there be machine guns and submarines in 1899.  However, I think this may be getting a little picky.  Overall, I thought this was a great film and I think other films should learn from this one.
