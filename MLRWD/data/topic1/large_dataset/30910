The first time I couldn't turn out the lights after watching a horror movie was when I saw "Psycho" for the first time in Aunt Val's flat in London - slept in the day room with all the lights on. This film  was the second time, and I wasn't interested at all at first. It's the  final sequence that gets you - it's not at all your typical terror tale,  with maniacs running around with axes or strange creatures from beyond the  grave/the Black Lagoon/the director's last hangover or whatever the latest  craze is. This movie sneaks up on you, posing as a simple little suspense  tale about a policeman doggedly doing his duty, aware but oblivious to the  stark, raving weirdness that surrounds him. But that's how it sucks you in,  playing on our tendency toward "yes it's strange, but it won't hurt  you" when it comes to anything other worldly. Agatha Christie once  said the scariest monsters were the little old grannies with their poisoned  knitting needles - this movie will not only make you believe that, it will  have you wondering, even just a little, about just how charming some of  your friends' idosyncrasies really are. I dare you to watch it all the way  through the end.
