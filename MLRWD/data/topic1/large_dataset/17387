With Antonioni's The Passenger having recently been re-released on DVD, and just having bought a new player and LCD screen, I've gotten on an Antonioni binge, and let me say, first of all, that this print is spectacular.  It is a beautiful remastering job, and I've got to say that this alone made the experience of this picture very different from when I saw it in college years ago.  The images are just gorgeous.

As with the much later film, The Passenger, the guts of this film are not in the plot.  The plot (which is well-described in other reviews) is, frankly, presented in a slow, ambling, and sometimes almost aimless manner.  As with The Passenger, the narrative thread is often enough not clear, and more questions are raised than answered.

But, at least for this viewer, that causes the focus of attention to turn more to the visual content of the film, and the rhythm.  In that way, it weaves it's magic.  And a print of this quality really helps make that happen.  Sure, I agree with those that find the ending unsatisfying.  But so can be the real world.  And with a willing immersion in Antonioni's visual language, we have the opportunity to see another way to view the world, and, perhaps strangely (in the midst of all of this talk of alienation and emptiness), that way can be very beautiful, indeed.  Strongly recommended, but give it some patience.
