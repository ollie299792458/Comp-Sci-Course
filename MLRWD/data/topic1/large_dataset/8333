First of all, I respect H.B.Haliki for his passion in wanting to make movies to thrill audiences and make himself a renown independent film maker. He made this movie (gone in 60 seconds 1973), the Junkman, and Deadline Auto Theft. His fourth film, Gone in 60 seconds 2, was never completed due to his accidental death during production. He showed with a strong determination, and a good bank account, you can do what you set your mind and heart to. I collected his films, due to his originality in film making, always raising the bar to do what has never been done before on film.I purchased this dvd when it came in 2005, watched it a couple of times and gave it away. I regretted getting rid of it because I did enjoy the film, especially the last 40 minutes of it. So I bought me a new copy a couple of days ago and watched it twice already. It does lack qualities you see in larger produced films, but that is the charm of it. One of my favorite cars is of course the mustang, Whether it be a 67 fastback or a 73 Mach 1, I love them. And this film captures every guys dream who has one or wishes he has one, on driving fast and furious. The chase seen is long, but not the longest, that honor goes to my my favorite car chase flick, Vanishing point, 1971. Hats off to the folks who restored this film, you guy's, truly have an art form there. So watch this movie or any other of his films, enjoy them for there originality, action and testosterone levels that they reach.
