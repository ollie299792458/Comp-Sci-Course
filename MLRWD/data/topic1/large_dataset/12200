First, let me say that the CHARLIE CHAN DVDs (all 3 recent Volumes by FOX and the 6-disc earlier "CHANTHOLOGY" set by MGM ... also the 2 latest MR. MOTO Volumes) are of SUPERB quality restoration and the DVD Box artwork is OUTSTANDING! HOWEVER ... being a 'collector' it would be considerate of FOX (who was the frontrunner in producing and offering those wonderful Multi-thin-pak DVD sets ... TWILIGHT ZONE, LOST IN SPACE, VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, etc) to respect the fact that they are 'killing' us collectors with these "concrete brick-sized" collector's Box Sets!!!! PLEASE (ALL CORPORATE DVD COMPANIES) - start (or continue) using Thin-Pak, or the Fold-open book-like DVD sets (as done with TV's ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN, WILD WILD WEST, THE UNTOUCHABLES, the latest JAMES BOND COLLECTION, MGM's TARZAN COLLECTION, HAWAII FIVE-0, TV's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE ... etc)! We collectors appreciate having MORE SPACE ON OUR SHELVES ... so that we can HAVE MORE SPACE to add MORE DVD SETS to our collections!!! The WORST abomination of "HUGE packaging" was MGM's CHARLIE CHAN "CHANTHOLOGY" (4-inches in width & 6-Discs)! This could have easily been collected in ONE STANDARD SIZE DVD SNAP-CASE (and onto 3 double sided DVDs instead of 6)... using less than half-an inch of materials! In all forms of our lives we need to CONSERVE whenever possible, so material-wise, space-wise ... this is certainly the way to go (and it would also be a lot cheaper to produce!!!!). Here is my list of the latest horrendously 'OVER-SIZED' DVD-Sets (which I would GLADLY REPLACE with newer COMPACT versions): CHAN'S "CHANTHOLOGY", CHAN BOX SETS 1-3, ALIEN "QUADRILOGY", INDIANA JONES "COMPLETE MOVIE COLLECTION", MR MOTO BOX SETS 1 & 2, "ORIGINAL" STAR WARS TRILOGY, PLANET OF THE APES "LEGACY COLLECTION", BATMAN "MOVIE ANTHOLOGY" .... and I could surely add others. So, PLEASE (DVD Companies) ... DOWNSIZE, DOWNSIZE!!
Whew! Again, all of these sets are well-produced, but please make our sets more collectible and shelf-friendly.

Thank you.
