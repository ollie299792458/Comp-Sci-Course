To say that Mostly Martha is a movie about food is limiting it to something less than what it really is.  It is a beautiful movie about what it means to happy in life (Its more than just a dream job).  The movie is relevant to cooks and non-cooks alike and is a good date movie for the romanitics out there.

This movie uses food as metaphor on several levels to express how each character sees love.  Martha (Martina Gedneck) believes that if you present something (a dish) well with your heart in it, the people receiving it naturally should love it regardless. If the person doesnt love it she is naturally hurt.  Lina (Maxime Foerste, she's great!) believes that since the death of her mother she can't love, thus she can't eat.  Lastly Mario, the fantastic Itallian Chef, believes food and love are a part of a good life.  He exudes this principle and gets on with everyone especially well except for Martha.  See the movie and find out how all of this works out..

This movie is really beautiful.  If you are worried that the movie is going to be some iconoclastic german work that is going to require a lot of reading,  fear not.  It is great for all audiences.  Reading subtitles isnt bad and if you are learning german the language is easy to understand.  I recommend this film highly!
