If you have a sister, maybe watch this with her, it's about sisters, I guess ... If she's as horrible an actress as Diaz, CLUB HER TO DEATH WITH A SHOE. If you have this sort of relationship with your sibling, please seek help!  I'm serious.

Other than that burn it like an evil witch trying to eat your kidney!  I like a poignant 'chick flick', but this is not a chick flick, this is a collection of the tritest white American stereotypes thrown together.  Sleazy rich partners in law firms; whorish and dumb sister who steals money (oh, but she's not dumb because she's lazy and never read or studied, oh no, she has dyslexia); money hungry Jewish step mom; dad who is warm but totally disconnected (why is the dad never blamed in these movies?); unsatisfied career girl who just wants a good man to order her food; spunky WASP grandmother; heartwarming old man who dies (are old people tired of being inspiration for obnoxious, young jerks?); my favorite was the bland boyfriend who is part of the worst show of race tokenism I've ever seen ('Oh look, Johnny Blandman can talk to those black people about their fancy 'basketball', he's so nice')

Any movie where Diaz criticizes someone for being too skinny should be immediately banned throughout the world.  As for Diaz being 'hot'... ick!  Hard to have cellulite when your skin is taut on your bones.  ...and those teeth!  Like looking at a Mexican Day of the Dead doll.

If you must have a 'chick flick' try the older Fried Green Tomatoes or Chocolat or Eat/drink, Man/Woman, or even A Walk to Remember.... anything.  There is no meaning or warmth in this movie!
