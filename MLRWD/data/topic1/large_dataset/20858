I saw this film without any prior knowledge of its troubled production, and that is perhaps why I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.  Why is everyone being so unkind to it?  It is entertaining, but more than that it is full of funny moments and quick witticisms that you have to be alert to catch.  Time will be kind to this film, I think, because the producers seem to have been aware that nothing new could be said about the subject matter so instead have some fun with it.  There is, for example, an excrutiatingly funny scene in which the wolf transformation of very vain young woman is coaxed out of hiding by affronting her vanity.  Now, the film is very rich in gay references and subplot, which I personally liked but will not appeal to everyone.  The plot does go astray there, because I sense something was being said about the "curse" of the werewolf being akin to the "curse" of being gay or having AIDS, but the point was not made. Now that I know of its many rewrites I see that something went wrong there.  But be that as it may.  It's a fun film, if you're open to it and alert to the jokes.  Wes Craven does not make masterpieces -- no one could accuse him of that -- but he does make entertaining films.  This picture is better than some of the work he has done but not worse.  And for what it's worth, Jesse Eisenberg is one sexy guy (get into the movie to see his transformation).  I think Michael Fox had a very homophobic line in Teen Wolf where he says, "I'm not gay.  I'm a werewolf."  There are no gay werewolves in this film, either, that we know of, but it's made abundantly clear that if there were it would be okay.  I like that.  Maybe that's why I like the film.  And kudos to Scott Baio for having such great sense of humor about himself.
