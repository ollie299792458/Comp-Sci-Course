Overall, this was a good PPV.

1) Shelton Benjamin vs Chris Jericho was easily the best match of the night and just shows what Shelton can offer the WWE over the next ten years or so. Jericho looked motivated for a change here and certainly helps this develop into match of the night - 9/10

2) Tag Team Turmoil - I'm not listing all the teams but this match was much better than I expected it being, due to the fact that they kept each fall down to a minimum ammount of time due to the crowd not really caring - 6.5/10

3) Chris Benoit vs Edge - This was the match that dissapointed me. I really thought with these two involved and with it being a last man standing match that we would have a **** quality match. Don't get me wrong this is still fairly good, just not up to the level Of Jericho/HHH's last man standing match - 7.5/10

4) Kane vs Viscera - lets face it who really wants to see Viscera on a PPV. Its bad enough having to watch him on Raw every week. But seriously this match was good for one thing, and that was giving Kane a much needed PPV victory. Admittedly Viscera crushing Trish after the match was an excellent visual and gave Trish the time off she needed to recover from her back injury - 5/10

5) HBK and Hogan vs Hassan and Daivari - make no mistake about it HBK did the carrying here. Just hearing Hogans pop when he makes his entrance is amazing, I still can't believe how loud it was. HBK worked his ass off in this one and to be fair so did Hassan and Daivari. Not to say Hogan put no effor in because he did, its just that he is limited in what he can do now because of his hip and knee injuries respectively - 7.5/10

6) HHH vs Batista - I enjoyed this match more than their mania match. I would give this ***.5 as opposed to their *** match at mania. HHH once again makes Batsita look like gold in this match. The angle revolving around the pedigree was worked nicely into the match and led to some intersetinf spots. A good main event - 8.5/10

To give this PPV ***** would be wrong because it is not that good, but apart from the Kane/Viscera match all the matches are watchable and provide good entertainment. Overall I would give Backlash 8/10
