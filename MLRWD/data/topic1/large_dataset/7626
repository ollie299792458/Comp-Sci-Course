...Fortunately I didn't have to.  These two brilliant actors star in Last Chance Harvey, a delightfully adult drama.  I was describing the film to a friend recently, and I told him, "It's not a comedy, really, but it's funny like real life."  And that sort of sums this film up for me.  It's far more like real life than you usually see on the big screen.

The story is a character study of two very real people.  Harvey Shine (Hoffman) is a 60-something jingle writer who always wanted to be a jazz pianist, but was never good enough.  He may have seen some success in the past, but his career is waning.  His marriage ended long ago, and it's clear he's not close to his daughter.  Nonetheless, he's flying to London for her wedding.  There Harvey encounters Kate Walker (Thompson) a lonely, 40-something woman who spends entirely too much time on the phone with her elderly mother.  She has close friendships and enriches her life with books and writing classes, but none of that makes up for what's missing.  An unlikely couple, when Kate and Harvey come together, they're greater than the sum of their parts.

And in the hands of Hoffman and Thompson, these characters couldn't be more believable, sympathetic, or true to life.  I defy you to watch the wedding toast without tearing up.  Last Chance Harvey isn't a big or flashy film, but it's smart and entertaining.  It's also given a nice DVD presentation, with a 16:30 making of featurette, and an above average commentary featuring writer/director Joel Hopkins, Emma Thompson, and Dustin Hoffman.  So often actor commentaries can be vacuous, but in the hands of these masters there were real insights into character and craft.  Overall, this film and its bonus features are highly recommended.
