I bought the Blu-ray version of this and have enjoyed this not only for the movie content but the extra stuff below:
- "Finding Marley"
- "Breaking the Golden Rule"
- "When not to Pee"
- Deleted Scenes
- On the Set with Marley: Dog of all Trades
- Animal Adoption (5:19)
- Gag Reel
- Dog Training Trivia Track (through out the movie)

I thought the "Animal Adoption" feature was by far the most informative short of how to adopt a dog feature that I have ever seen in less than six minutes. It has interviews of people who have adopted dogs from rescue and city shelters. It is just very informative with great pace with providing this information.

The other big bonus to me besides all the other great extras already mentioned by others is the "Dog Training Trivia Track" with Picture in Picture (PIP) video on BonusView enabled blu-ray players. YOU can chose to watch the individual clips separately, but I chose to watch the pop ups. Again this is so delicious in that it introduces to how to raise a pet with some good love. It has professional dog trainers sharing tips either with video or just pop up words that makes the movie even more enjoyable. At the 1:14 min (min:sec) into the movie a little pop up says, "Welcome to the Marley & Me Dog Training Track" and trust me if you are dog lover like me you will not be disappointed and it this delight. OK..one more hint at the 1:28 min mark (min:sec) it says, "Whether your dog is young or old, they can always benefit from training."  See what I mean?! Enjoy this gem folks.
