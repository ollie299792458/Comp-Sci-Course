To add my thoughts to the other reviews.
I enjoyed parts of this film, but think that prior works of this group are better.

IMO, the greatest weakness of this film is that it is a parody which resembles reality too closely.
Is reality funny or silly / stupid?

My  greatest pleasure was seeing these many actors and actresses who I know from other prior films from this group.
I enjoyed the directors comments.  I have the impression that the directors and producers enjoyed it perhaps more than I.

I am a little surprised that the technical quality is not better, OK, but for a modernly made film by a group of this caliber, expected better.

I have thought about the question of why this film did not appeal more to me.

Perhaps the directors could not decide if they were making a light drama, a satire, or a farce.
Can a film be all 3?

IMO, too much a drama.  IMO, interesting to watch (with DVD controller in hand).
