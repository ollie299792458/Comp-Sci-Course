I recently began including this video into my weekly workouts, and I absolutely love it. It comes with five 10 minute Pilates workouts that will kick your butt (literally). I've been doing the full 50 minute workout every day for 2 weeks and have really seen some results! I haven't gotten bored of the routine, and really enjoy the fact that you can turn on/off the music and/or commentary. The narrative is great in the beginning, the instructors explain which each workout does (tighten and lift your butt, or create long thigh muscles), which really helps keep you motivated. When doing the full 50 minute routine, the instructors do a wonderful job and keeping things flowing, and and the time really just flies by. No pilates equipment is needed, except a yoga mat and a chair which is nice. Even if you don't have an hour to dedicate each day, the five different routines make it easy to pick and choose what you would like to focus on. I just purchased the Core Fusion Arms and Abs DVD, and am excited to include that into my weekly workouts as well!

One thing I would suggest, is spending more time stretching in between exercises. They only spend about 1-2 minutes stretching and I personally feel that I need longer to really stretch out those areas I just worked out (to avoid bulky muscles), so I pause it for another few minutes and do a few yoga stretches, which also allows me to bring my focus back on my breathing before beginning the next exercise.
