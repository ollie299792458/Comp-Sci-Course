There were no detectable audio problems. Case stated Closed Captioned but there were no options available on the DVD. Picture was color and displayed perfectly on my 4:3 format TV(case states aspect ratio 4:3). Picture detail was good with only 2 video imperfections on this DVD detected, a matrix of white dots across top of screen and a red spot over the face of the copilot(in order of appearance), but these were momentary defects.

This DVD did play on my Windows 7 Ultimate PC with a Dell HD monitor and resolution set at 1900 x 1200, using both Windows Media Player 12 and VideoLAN's VLC Player v.1.1.10. The picture displayed with vertical black bars on each side of the picture for both Windows Media Player 12 and VideoLAN's VLC Player v.1.1.10. Resolution was not as good as on my 4:3 format TV. HD monitors vary in their ability to down convert a signal source(720p) below its capability(full HD).

On my Windows XP SP3 laptop with resolution set at 1400x1050 using InterVideo WinDVD 7 software, the picture displayed better than on the HD monitor and the software controls are better as well than either Windows Media Player 12 or VideoLAN's VLC Player v.1.1.10. The picture displayed with vertical black bars on each side of the picture like both Windows Media Player 12 and VideoLAN's VLC Player v.1.1.10 on my Windows 7 Ultimate PC, except that the bars were much thinner compared to those displayed on my Dell monitor.
