As a long time fan of The Fugitive, and a purchaser of every other season set, I finally feel compelled to comment on this issue that keeps coming up in regards to music in this series.

There are a lot of people taking great issue with CBS changing any of the music in these episodes. Based on reading some of the reviews here, I actually think that some people believe that CBS is doing it on purpose. That is ridiculous! Folks, keep in mind here that this series was created and contracts were signed in the early to mid 1960's... long before any thought of home video or DVD sales.  That means in order to legally produce these DVDs, CBS has to get permission and licensing deals from ALL the artists that contributed to the series.  Music is especially troublesome as it has composers, performers, and publishers to get clearance and agreements with.  If that can not be accomplished or the original artists or their decendants can not be located, there may be no choice but to substitute in some music. At the very least, CBS has to proceed with much caution. It is either that or not release the series at all.  Personally, I will take the former.

Now this is just my opinion, but the keys to this series are the performances of Janssen and Morse, the writing, and the premium guest stars.  Music would probably come in fourth or fifth in terms of importance.

So instead of vilifying CBS, I will actually applaud them and encourage them to continue to release the rest of these season sets (Season Three Volume 2 is due out in December) so I can continue watching until the day the running stops!
