I noticed this film currently has no reviews, and so had to put in my two cents.  Anyway, to sum it up, if you are a war film enthusiast like I am, this film is a MUST HAVE.  Being produced by A&E, you can be sure it is pretty historically accurate, and still manages to tell the incredible, and TRUE story of a single battalion in WWI that moves forward in one of the last major offensives of WWI.  The rest of the Allied adance gets halted, then pushed back, except for this one battalion that doesn't get that memo.  The Germans throw everything they have at this unit, and as the American soldiers they were, they kicked ass! :) This battle was so fierce, two or three of the officers got Medals of Honor, with several enlisted members earning Silver Stars and the like.  They suffered massive casualties.
And if your afraid that this film, being made by A&E, is some low-budget, bad-acting film only to be tolerated because of the story itself, relax.  It might be low-budget- I saw nothing wrong with the special effects, there were nice explosions, the Allied charge across No Man's Land in the first few minutes of the movie was incredible to see, and the wounds received by the men looked plenty realistic- and I would know. I've been to Iraq twice, and counting. :P
Lastly, if you care about such things, Rick Schroder even LOOKS a lot like Maj. Whittelsy, the guy he portrays.
Again, this movie is a real treasure, being not only one of the rare movies made about WWI, but a fantastically-made movie at that.
