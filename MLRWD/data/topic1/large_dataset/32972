This is among the best movies I've ever seen. Real prisoners were used during its filming, as extras and apparently the main character had never starred in a movie before. Simply amazing. The story begins in prison and takes a guy with no ties to anyone, anything, who is simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, who "rises up" in the world of organized crime. The movie is not really, to me, about "organized crime" but rather regards relationships, and how people can aspire to move upwards in the world--good or bad, and how "chance" can often come into play. A lot of times, the main character simply makes choices--right or wrong--and these choices are filmed in the most natural way. My fav scene is where the main character is in the airport, going through security and he sticks out his tongue for the airport guards to see, not understanding this is not necessary outside the prison world--this scene is subtle and beautifully done, with no mention of it by the airport security. There is a mysticism about this movie, a "flow" that is so natural and beautiful that it doesn't even seem like you're watching a film. The story is amazingly done in a very realistic way and chronicles a guy's rise within the organized crime world, but again, it's not a Godfather-type movie (thank goodness, too, as if there weren't enough of those already). Stellar acting from "Caesar" the older mob boss and the main character. "Caesar" is left to basically rot in prison as punishment, alone. A very sad/intriguing movie that ends when it should. Very well filmed, acted, and directed. A beautiful film. I suppose the title can mean a lot of things.. to me, it simply means the character was a sort of "prophet" because of his choices. He saw his chances in life, and took them. The "deer scene" to me had little relevance, but that scene in fact saved his life possibly. Every actor in this movie was outstanding. This movie felt quiet authentic.
