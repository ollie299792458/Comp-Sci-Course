There's nothing to really say about the film itself that has not been said many times before.  This is _the_ standard for the sometimes overdone art of mockumentary filmmaking.  Viewers owe this film a debt of gratitude for any and all films in the genre since thenk, including the brilliant work of Christopher Guest.  One would think that even The Blair Witch boys owe a nod to Tap for the reality style of fiction.
Beyond the sheer brilliance and hilarity of the movie itself, the extra features of this new DVD release make it a must-own, even if you have the original DVD release.  The extra footage is over an hour in length, with deleted scenes that are just as funny as some of the bits in the movie.  The scene where the limo driver gets intoxicated and sings in his underwear is a scream.  Also, there are things like television spots for some sort of packaged sandwich thing that are great for Tap fanatics.  Even the automatic menu opening when the disc is popped in is funny, with the Tapsters commenting on the logo.
Anyone who is in the music business, has seen the music business, or simply loves music, will find this movie hilarious.  The extra features are only one more strong reason to buy this and put it in a place of honor on the DVD shelf.
