After seeing "The Wild", I was truly afraid to see any of Disney's most recent films. But three Disney films changed my mind: "Bridge to Terabithia", "Enchanted", and "Ratatoille". The animation in "Ratatoille" was nothing short of spectacular, and if you see it for nothing else, see it for the beauty of the animation. The story itself was not dumb or completely predictable or filled to the brim with bathroom humor like a lot of plotlines it kids' movies are right now (like "Over the Hedge" and "Happily N'ever After"), and was pretty original: a rat named Remy (with a knack for cooking) teams up with an underdog named Linguini (who couldn't cook if his life depended on it but is in bad need of a job) to work as a chef in a famous Parisian restaurant. Remy's method of doing all of the cooking while Linguini appears to be doing it himself is a bit complicated for me to explain (you'll get it if you watch the movie), but the idea of the film is, quite literally, that "anyone can cook" (or pursue their passions) even if they're just a rat.
