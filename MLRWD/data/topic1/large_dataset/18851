Robin Williams can do anything and everything well. In this film, his aging homosexual role is understated. He's got the walk, the wrist, the clothes...he is the perfect stereotype of the older gay male. He's as funny as ever.

Nathan Lane's tour de force as Williams' "wife" couldn't be funnier or, depending on how you view "the life", pathetic. He is a genius in this role and there are times you actually do think of him as a woman, especially when he tells Williams while folding laundry, "You never wanted to share your son with me."

Agador, the barefoot half-naked Latino house-boy/girl, comes close to stealing the flim from Williams, an almost impossible feat, but he almost pulls it off, especially when he whines about not being able to take part in Williams' drag shows. Those too-short scenes are hilariously funny. Agador's role in this story at first seems peripheral but you realize quickly that it is integral to the entire gay scene and especially to this film. Agador's role rounds out the picture perfectly.

Another hilarious scene is when Williams and Lane, about to be "interviewed" by Williams' straight son's future in-laws (Gene Hackman and Dianne Weist) who don't know they're a gay couple, come to call. But before they do, Williams tries to teach Lane how to be masculine in his walking, talking and tea drinking. Both men are brilliant in this blast of a scene.

There is a scene where Williams is trying to teach one of his hired drag queens to show more enthusiasm in his dancing role for the drag club; in the scene, Williams takes off on one of his famous spontaneous stream-of-consciousness riffs that, unfortunately, only lasts about ten seconds but it is truly a riot.

This is a very funny film. Exceptionally funny, in fact. You don't have to agree that homosexuality is normal in order to enjoy this film for its sheer hilarity. If, like me, you can get past your moral objections to homosexual behavior long enough, you will love this laugh-fest.
