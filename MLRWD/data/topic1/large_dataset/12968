This is one of those films that is embarassing to watch:  for starters, it isn't very funny.  The jokes and stunts, most of them hip-racial (of course) or of the bathroom variety (of course), are boring and tired; the story isn't particularly original and the acting is transparent.  The alien flying around the mall was pretty cool (and very well done), but of course they had to shoot it down and then - - just in case you don't get the point - - overkill the poor thing.  But it's really much worse than that.  A bad movie is just that.  As it turns out, however, EVOLUTION is really nothing more than an extended advertisement for Head And Shoulders shampoo - - and the joke on the viewer, who presumably has paid to watch this tripe, is the ultimate punchline.  Talk about product placement - - these people should be ashamed of themselves.  That the producers don't even try to disguise what they are doing only testifies to the fact that they think you are an idiot; they presume that you will find it cute and funny.  But it isn't.  Anybody who pays to see this film should, at the very least, get a refund check in the mail.  In fact, anyone who sees this film should be paid, period.  What an insult.
