I picked up this series a few weeks ago, and really enjoyed rewatching this season again, after just watching the second season.  Now, when I watch the secnd season over again this series will get even better.  All of the characters are great together and the chemisrty between them is fantastic.  Artie, is the perfect leader for this crew,  Mrs. Fredricks, gets even more complicated with every episode.  Pete, and Myka, they are a whole show on they're own. Though, I don't agree that Pete is total screw-up, as a few reviewers have mentioned, although, to me his character is still developing.  His cookie fetish, and his somewhat childish sayings are just part of himself that he is protecting himself from others. I also think that a whole new side of him will be coming out in future episodes. I had a problem with Claudia at the beginging, but I like her as well, though not sure about Lida, the Houskeeper at the house, future episodes will tell.  I loved all the episodes but especially blowout ending on the last episode.  Eagerly awaiting for the second season on DVD.  And especially waiting for the third season on SYFY this coming summer.  If your looking for an exciting new series to watch give this series a try, you might just get hooked.
