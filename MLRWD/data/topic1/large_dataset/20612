Having first been so excited by the mini-series of The Odyssey I cannot believe that Hollywood has dropped back into the comic '50's versions of historical classics! Having endured the full two discs I feel totally depressed. What's wrong with it? Everything almost!!. Anyone who has any acquaintance with the original tale should be out torching this version. Others have pointed out the obvious distortions of the facts, but even given that it should have looked good! It ain't, it's as cheesey and less interesting to look at than Xenia. Visually it is disgraceful - rayon ribbons on tunics, obvious sewing machine lines, and colors that should earn the designer a B Minus for knowledge. Doesn't the costume designer know that emerald greens and blue purples didn't exist before the 1860's? And the sets are just as poor. Terrible CGI (those thousand boats!!) and not one iota of a sense of a real and vivid city. There appeared to be only one staircase in Troy and everyone, but everyone ran up and down it. Hollywood did it better with the silly version with Rossana Podesta as Helen in the '50's. The only saving grace was the actress playing Cassandra - she, at least had a sense of the drama she was in and convinced as one who could see and dreaded the future. The acting was fairly poor - but who could expect more from this travesty of a script - and all I can say (being in shock as I am) is that Helen's nipples looked quite tempting in her one good costume of chiffon.I might have accepted this if it was a dream-sequence from The Young and the Restless, but for serious viewing this is a crock. Let us all go on our knees and pray that the Wolfgang Peterson movie of "Troy" will give us the sense of that fabulous city Homer sings of.
