I gave this a single star. My sweetheart said she liked it and would have given it three stars. The scrip seems more or less written to TV sitcom level, i.e. fairly low.  On TV it would blend in nicely with the general level of sitcom nonsense.

The major character, Bill, is a loser, and there is no reason to think that he would have ever been married into a successful family with a pretty wife. However Bill does have the insight that he is a loser and makes some effort to reform himself, but at the end of the movie when he decides to quit his marriage, quit his job, quit/ abandon his plans to run a donut shop to give him some income and self-respect, he seems headed to a even worse future since he wouldn't even be up to fast food employee standards.

A confession: I looked at this movie exclusively because of Jessica Alba's presence in it as eye candy.  Jessica was fresh and alluring as always, and had the good sense not to let her character be exploited such as to lose her dignity.

Otherwise, this is a throughly forgetable film.
