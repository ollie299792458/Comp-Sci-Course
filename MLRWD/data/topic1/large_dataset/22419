"David, a 12-year-old, escapes from a Communist concentration camp with little more than a compass, a sealed letter, a loaf of bread, and instructions to carry the letter to Copenhagen, Denmark. David is thrust into the free world for the first time in his young life as he travels across Europe. His spiritual voyage of discovery, where David slowly loses his instinctive mistrust of humanity and begins to smile, share, trust and ultimately, love, addresses the cruelties, politics, and suffering of warfare while celebrating the resilience of youth and the unbreakable spirit of a child." review from Netflix, My comments is please see this film if you love movies with a powerful message of hope. It is a great film to watch with your children ages 12 and over. This precious young boy grew up in a Communist concentration camp after being separated from his parents and he only grew to know his world is full of suffering and bad things. When he escapes from the camp, he meets good people along the way and eventually he was able to even smile. To me, this film symbolizes that darkness cannot obstruct the light from ones life no matter how horrible things appear to be.
