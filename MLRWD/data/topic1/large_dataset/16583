Every so often a genius of kinesthetic flow arrives in the world; Enter the Dragon is an opportunity to witness first hand the phenominal ability of Li Jun Fan (Bruce Lee) at the very top of his craft. I feel safe in saying that there is no other martial artist put on film that has such dynamic presence and amazing focus as Lee; and Enter the Dragon captures this intensity like no other film.

This film is the first in many ways. Not only the first Chinese/American team up of a martial arts film, it is the very first true martial arts picture ever to be filmed in English. Martial arts star Sammo Hung is highlighted in the first five minutes of the film (first time I believe) and there is even a bit part for an extremely young Jackie Chan (watch closely) as the recipient of Lee's "fists of fury".  Starring Bruce Lee, John Saxon and new-comer Jim Kelly, Lee plays a Shaolin monk that is convinced by British Authorities (at the time Governing Hong Kong) to infiltrate an island via a martial arts tournament run by a rogue Shaolin monk named Han (Played by Shih Kien). The government wants Lee to infiltrate the tournament and contact them with information of Han's activities.

The film is laced with Lee's Zen philosophy of life. He uses martial arts as a metaphor for all of life and a vehicle in which to understand all of life's big questions. This film is Lee's final masterpiece as the Little Dragon died 6 days before the US release of Enter the Dragon. This film is a testament to an amazing human being that managed to bridge the gap between East and West. A must see for anyone interested in Martial Arts or Eastern thought.
