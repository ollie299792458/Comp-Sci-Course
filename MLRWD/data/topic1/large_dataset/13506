These are real people involved in the real world of governments, security, spying, underword characters etc.
Don't expect a glossy US series. This is more European/British in tone.
Sure kept my interest.
I'm waiting for the second series.

End of Intelligence?
I've previously blogged about my fondness for the TV show Intelligence and after the great season finale in December, I now have a free block of time on Monday nights.

Apparently I was not the only one complaining about CBC's lack of advertising and promotion of the show on its network especially prior to the season premiere. The creator of Intelligence, Chris Haddock also points to the lack of promotion as a part of the reason for relatively poor ratings for Intelligence and goes on to accuse CBC of trying to bury the show.

Indeed, it appears that the CBC is unwilling to commit to renewing the series for another season. Judging from message boards and posts, viewers of the show REALLY like it and are passionate about it but I guess if the ratings aren't high enough, the CBC doesn't care.

Is there any hope that the CBC will come to its senses and bring back Intelligence for a third season???
