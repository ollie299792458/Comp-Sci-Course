I was amazed at this documentary. So was my husband. We thought hands down it is one of the finest documentaries ever made - and not because of the subject matter, I'll get to that in a minute - but because of its ability to step off of the timeline, outside of our culture and world events and look upon the larger picture of events that have transpired and are transpiring now.

The subject matter is Ronald Reagan and all his flaws and human limitations are there for the reviewing. He is laid bare as on an operating table, but there is something else too. He is presented also as a human conduit (almost a "tool") for something way bigger and more important.

For those who don't think evil exists at all, I say, don't rent or buy this DVD. It is not an apologetic for evil existing. It rightly assumes it. For those who think there is no evil in the world except the ideology of Reagan and his ilk, don't delay in seeing this. All your criticisms of Reagan will be named and explained against the backdrop of a bigger picture, the one you need to see.

No one learns from history, not in all of history has a lesson been learned, but rather, Evil continues it's foray, persistent, relentless, always shrouded in the appearance of "light," "peace" and "goodness." It has duped the world many times over. This documentary strips it bare, exposes the fraud and leaves an undeniable responsiblity with the viewer.
