I honestly feel sorry for this generation of kids, cause they all turn up their noses at the really good kid's movies like this. Sure, so the idea of mutated pizza-loving reptiles who also have martial arts abilities seems stupid, but I'd say the plot has a lot more potential than all the fluff out there that is all parents consider appropriate anymore.  I can't really describe what it is about this movie. It just has a certain mood that they don't quite capture in any of the sequels. And it actually does have drama in it, though you wouldn't THINK that a bunch of turtles and a rat could make you cry. One thing I love about this movie is that all of the turles have their own personality; in the sequels and the more recent cartoon version they all act exactly alike, and are all, well, STUPID. 
  Probably my favorite scene is the long fight in April O' Neill's apartment; from the point where the enemies bust in through the ceiling to where the fire starts and then they all go to...well, maybe I shouldn't spoil anything. Just go out and rent this, watch it with the kids, see if they prefer it over their little Power Rangers and Dragonball Z.
