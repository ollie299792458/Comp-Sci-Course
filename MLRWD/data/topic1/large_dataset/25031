This is the movie I always recommend, no matter who asks.  My teenaged daughters and their friends have enjoyed as well as my friends and co-workers.  I have watched this movie many times and find a little something more each time.
The story appears at first to be a series of unrelated stories that  begin and end aburptly, leaping from one set of characters to another randomly.  Gradually a pattern begins to emerge and connections begin to appear, some I anticipated but others caught me totally off guard.  The various relationships - couples, parent/child, siblings, in-laws - all ring true.  These are characters that draw a viewer into their lives.
It would be difficult to say who 'stars' in this film. The cast is packed with well-known actors, Gillian Anderson, Ellen Burstyn, Sean Connery, Anthony Edwards, Angelina Jolie, Jay Mohr, Ryan Phillippe, Dennis Quaid, Gena Rowlands, Jon Stewart and Madeleine Stowe. All give stellar performances but none dominate the movie or distract from the story.  
There is no violence, some profanity and sexual situations but nothing graphic or excessive.  The only flaw I see in this gem is after having nearly every character in this film repeat the line about "talking about love is like dancing about architecture" why did they change the title from the original 'Dancing About Architecture' to the very forgettable 'Playing By Heart'?
