I made the mistake of buying all 3 series at once, being attracted by the title.  This is misleading:  the series covers only one of the Tudor monarchs - and that only partially.  The series is full of errors:  Henry's sister, Margaret, married neither the king of Portugal OR Charles Brandon (she actually married the King of Scotland);  Wolsey died of natural causes (not by cutting his throat);  I could go on . . .  Thomas Tallis is portrayed as, first a homo- then hetero-sexual (which has no relevance to the plot whatever).  My main complaint is that, despite there being a number of portraits of Henry, so that we all know what he looked like, a handsome, sexy actor has been chosen to appeal to the female viewers who, presumably, would not be as excited to see a real likeness of Henry - getting fatter as he gets older and spending much of his middle age with an ulcerated leg (which smelled).  No one is going to be enamoured with that!  Every episode contains a number of steamy sex scenes, even when these are unnecessary to the plot (dreams, for example).  The costumes are magnificent.  If only the same attention to detail could have been paid to the script (sloppy lines in the first episode include a "summit" meeting and I'm sure I heard someone say, "Ok"!).

I'm sorry to conclude that this is aimed mainly at an American audience who have little knowledge of English history.  It illustrates a perfect example of a producer whose only priority is to chase the ratings.
