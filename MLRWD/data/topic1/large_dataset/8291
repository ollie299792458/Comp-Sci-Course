Yes, like a lot of other reviewers point out, many of these disks are faulty and that sucks a lot of value and enjoyment out of the content. The disks are faulty in the sense that they don't play well on a range of players. I have four DVD players around the house each of which stumbles over the discs at some point or another so I have to chop and change. It can be an irritating process and it means I can't just sit and watch the discs where I choose - instead, the discs often dictate where and therefore when I can watch them. None of the many hundreds of other DVDs and Blu Rays I own behave like this.

Other reviews say enough about the content which is, of course, excellent. But the poor quality of the disks, and the consequent inability to access that content, makes that fact to some degree irrelevant.

UPDATE: I've downgraded my rating from ** to *. These disks are maddening. If I can't watch the material I've bought, how is that different from not having the material at all? Oh, I know - I could have saved my money and had the same experience. Still struggling to get this junk to play on a range of players. Absolute disgrace, I've never seen this kind of problem with any other disk or any other collection.
