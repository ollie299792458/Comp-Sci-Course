When I was a kid I loved Winnie the Pooh and his adventures with Christopher Robin & friends. Now an adult I passed my love for those characters to my kids. Disney has taken the early adventures and put them on this DVD set. Restored and enhanced my family & I can watch them again and again. There are special features which include: Disney's "My Friends Tigger & Pooh" bonus episode
  "A Day for Eeyore" animated short
  The Story Behind the Masterpiece: The making of the Winnie the Pooh featurette
  The 100 Acre Wood Challenge game
  "The Winnie the Pooh Theme Song" performance by Carly Simon
  "Pooh's Shadow" Disney storyline
  Pooh's Pop-Up fun facts
  Winnie-the-Pooh art gallery
  "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" sing-along song
This title sits in my multi disc DVD Player as the kids love watching it. As a fan of the series I enjoy watching it just as I did when I was a child. Thank you Disney for keeping these childhood memories for us all and to bring in new fans of that Willy, nilly, silly old bear!!
