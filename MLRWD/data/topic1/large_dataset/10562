Cute fun movie. Freddie highmore plays an over active child that doesn't obey rules. He's the youngest boy of the 5 children. Father goes off to war (WW1). Mother stays behind to take care of things for a little while then meets the kids later. Kids get shiped off to a relative. Father places the oldest boy in charge and freddie thinks he's old enough not to obay him. The two sisters and baby girl fill out the rest of the group. The first day at the relatives, the 4 kids make it to dinner and recieves the multi page rules. Freddie doesn't make it to dinner. He's too busy doing what he isn't suppose to do. He was told not to go in the green house. So of course that's where he ends up and discovers a locked door to a hut in the green house. He drags his brother and sisters to the green house and the little baby somehow unlocks the door. Then that's when they follow the tunnel to the beach to find "it". (The sand fairy). Then the adventure with the wishes begins. The wish is only good for a day (untill sunset) and the wishes never really go the way they were intended.The next day things go back to normal (unbroken) as if the wish never happened. But people remember what happened that day.
