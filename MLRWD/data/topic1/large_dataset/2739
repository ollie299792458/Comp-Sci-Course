First off, beware if you don't like this movie and dare to utilize your first amendment right to voice your opinion on this site. You will get attacked!! You would think these people had a personal stake in the movie. In my humble opinion, I would advise you to save your money and not to waste your time on this one, seriously, this wasn't even mediocre, it was just a WTF and I watching kind of movie. I do love his other stuff though. It struck me as a cheaply made,cheap effects, guess it was supposed to be funny kind of movie but wasn't. I've never so much as even seen an advertisement about this movie and now I know why. I simply walked into the movie section saw Will Farrell's picture on the cover and thought what the heck, this could be funny, being the huge fan that I am, purchased it. I did however, read the cover thoroughly and nowhere does it say that it's Spanish speaking ONLY. It never even occurred to me to ask anyone if it was entirely in Spanish because Will Farrell ISN'T SPANISH. By the way, to address other reviewers regarding the title, the fact that the title is in Spanish doesn't mean one should deduce that the entire movie is in Spanish. I have seen plenty of movies with foreign sounding titles that were in English. Using that logic, I guess Nacho Libre was in Spanish...Oh wait, it wasn't.. I get it, this is a spoof and this would probably be appreciated more so by moviegoers who are familiar with Spanish soap operas. Some people are not fans of the genre and don't deserve to have their intelligence insulted because of it. However, this is just my opinion, I know MANY will disagree..for those who enjoy it, great! Have a nice day.
