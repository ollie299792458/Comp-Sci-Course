The Movie Motorcycle Diaries, chronicles the coming of age journey of Ernesto "Che" Guevera and his friend the chubby Alberto, as they flirt, and crash their way through Latin America. You'll see what I mean about crashing. One cool movie though. We see the development of Ernesto becoming "Che," his anger at the unfair treatment of poor and lowly, and its easy to see how he would become a champion for the disinfranchised and the "real" people of the world. Culminating in a beautiful speech given by Ernesto near the end of the film, in regards to the stupidity of borders and nations in Latin America, "from Mexico to Argentina we are one Mestizo people."  No the film doesn't spell out Che's eventual political affiliations with socialism, that's right socialism, not communism, there is a difference you know. We know where his loyalties end up so we don't really need to know. The film doesn't spell this out for us we are told, though in more subtle ways.

The film is really a beautiful piece of work, some of the most gorgeous cimenatogrophy that I've ever seen, fog covered lakes, and rain soked jungle covered mountain passes, the total visual effect of the this film is outstanding, just wish it had been dubbed, so I could have caught even more of the effect.
