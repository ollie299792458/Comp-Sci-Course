I'd heard nothing about this movie,(which is strange given just how good it is), but after reading the glowing reviews, I watched. And as I watched, I became the proverbial fly on the wall-witness to all the characters secret wishes, flaws and humanity. I loved almost everything about it; the acting, the Italian language, the scenory, the time period but most of all the theme. It's a food/restaurant themed movie true, but of course that isn't really the heart of it. It's about two, very different, Italian immigrant brothers, struggling to achieve their dream...the "american dream". I laughed and cried and was transported back in time while my senses were being indulged by the cooking scenes,mmm! The only criticism I have,and I hate to use the word "criticism",is the ending. It's one of those "No! I don't want it to be over yet" movies. It's not hard to imagine what direction each of the character's lives end up taking, but I found myself longing for the movie to go on just a few minutes more,so I could glimpse into the futures of each lovely character.
