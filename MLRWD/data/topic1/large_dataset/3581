An Eye For An Eye

  In the 1987 film, Angel Heart, director Alan Parker elaborately relays to his audience the underlying theme that a person, despite his or her best attempt, cannot cheat and prosper in life.  Utilizing a vast array of symbolism, cultural ideology, and clever subterfuge, Parker portrays the unsuccessful attempt of his main character, Harold Angel (Mickey Rourke), to 'have his cake and eat it too' by cheating both God and Satan.

  In "Angel Heart", the old adage that 'cheaters never prosper' comes to life on the screen in a horrifying manner, as the destruction of both self and others unfolds in a most hell-like fashion.  Seemingly, Parker is telling his audience to not be deceived...that nobody, despite his or her best attempt, can cheat and prosper in life.

  I thoroughly enjoyed "Angel Heart".  I give it a five-star thumbs up.  I bought this DVD from Amazon.com for the purpose of writing a college level essay on symbology in films.  It turned out to be an excellent choice.  I highly recommend the film, but caution parents to use discretion.  There is a bit of filthy language, some gore, and a sexual scene that I feel should not be viewed by children under age 18.  Use discretion, but enjoy.  The symbology is unsurpassed.
