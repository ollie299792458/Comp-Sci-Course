I, too, wish I had read more reviews before buying the set. Although the interview with Loggia was great (I remember him fondly as ex-cat burglar Thomas Hewitt Everett Cat from the old one-season 'T.H.E. Cat' series that played at 9:30 on NBC Fridays long ago...I think U.N.C.L.E. was playing afterwards, but I could be wrong about that...it might have been the season Star Trek played at 10), the number of episodes of the two shows was VERY disappointing.

If Disney can give us an entire 17 hours of Spin and Marty, what's with three episodes each of these two? This is not a good value for $35. Most full seasons of 25 episodes of most TV shows are in this same price range.

Don't forget, Disney, you're talking TV shows here...ones that you're rerun on your own channels. (Unfortunately, when I didn't have access to the network.) Asking $35 for six episodes is VERY steep.

I wouldn't buy another set if they issued another with more episodes. Too pricy.
