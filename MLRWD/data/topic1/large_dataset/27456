A second movie came out in 1984 to easily snatch Beat Street's briefly held crown for worst hip hop movie.  Breakin' is so Hollywood it's set in Los Angeles, with only a few good dance performances thrown in to save it.  It has far more plot than Wild Style or Beat Street, but that plot is PG fluff revolving around a young White female jazz dancer (Lucinda Dickey as Kelly) who learns about "street dancing" and then claims it as her own.  Her teachers, real-life stars Adolfo "Shabba Doo" Quinones and Michael "Boogaloo Shrimp" Chambers, are indeed talented dancers, but in the West Coast styles known as poppin' and lockin', not breakin'.  These three characters form a crew in which they do very little break-dancing, suggesting that the title was a cheap marketing ploy to capitalize on the popularity of real b-boys.

 The dialogue is cheesy and written for children (absolutely no swearing or sex), with a sugar-sweet message about working hard and showing the rich dance snobs what you've got.  Although Kelly refers to their moves as "street dancing", she sees very little actual street, unless you count a clean, peaceful Venice Beach boardwalk.  The only rap music in the entire movie is during two scenes at the Radiotron club, which strangely feature future-Gangsta Ice-T with feel-good lyrics about achieving your dreams.

 Their goals realized, the new crew stars in their own Broadway show, "Street Jazz".  This performance, like much of the rest of the movie, is choreographed jazz and modern dance with wack costumes by someone who has probably never been to the Bronx.  It too exploits hip hop, and in the process gets it all wrong. Finally, the movie ends with no resolution of the love triangle that has been a major focus of the plot, but promises that Breakin' 2 is coming soon.
