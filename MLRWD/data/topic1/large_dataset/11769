I know the story of the Beast Of Bray Road, and heard there was some indie film about it, so decided to watch it on Sci-Fi.  I give it 2 stars because I wasn't the least bit bored.  It was an entertaining movie.  Normally, I'd give it 3, if I wasn't somewhat offended by it.  I'm from Wisconsin, Milwaukee to be exact, and the portrayal of the folks of the "small town" it took place in was really just wrong.  The townsfolk was depicted as abusive, slutty, dumb, and drunk.  (Well, okay, it is Wisconsin, and we're known for beer, so the drunk I don't care about)  Mostly, the people were portrayed as hicks.  I have family, not from Walworth, but from Saukville.  People from there aren't anything like that.  And they don't have Southern accents.  We're quite intelligent.  Sorry, I was upset about the portrayal.

Mostly, know this - the movie is entertaining.  You will pry enjoy it.  The story isn't based on a true story, since the Dogman has never killed anyone.  And the portrayal of the Wisconsinites was way off.  But it is a short movie, and a great way to kill time.  Check it out at least once.

I also found it rather odd they dedicated this film to the "great state of Wisconsin."  I don't even think it was filmed here.  Nevertheless, it was decent.  I love those cheap horror flicks that are on Saturday night on Sci-Fi.  And this was a good one for that category.
