First off, this movie is better on DVD than it was at the movies. With that being said, the film is still too short and it needed more of the Viola Davis character to make the movie more interesting.

The cast is stellar. Meryl Streep is flawless, but is basically playing a characiture of a dragon lady. Amy Adams is perfect as the innocent nun so is Hoffman as the "innocent" priest. Viola Davis is terrific in a most complicated role, which she brings to life with mesmerizing performance.

I have to say this though. I've seen The Reader in which Kate Winslet won her oscar over Meryl Streep for Doubt. And Streep got robbed. Winslet's part in The Reader was nowhere near as complicated as Streeps role. Streep conveys a wide range of emotions in Doubt, whilst Winslet just takes off her clothes and plays a moron. Winslet's role is not even really part that should of been nominated for oscar. HOWEVER, IT WAS KATE'S TURN TO WIN AN OSCAR--that's what Hollywood told us. It's crap. In my opion both Streep and Davis deserved awards for their work.
