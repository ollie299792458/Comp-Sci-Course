Paul Thomas Anderson is a brilliant filmmaker and cements his already sure status with this brilliant three hour opus. In 1997, he came into Hollywood with Boogie Nights, a 2 1/2 hour epic about a porn star's rise and fall in  1977. He preceeded that with Hard Eight, a 1997 film about gambling and the  relationship between a pro and a bum. His ear is for dialogue, his  characters are sympathetic and hopeful,and his real talents lie in the  brilliant Camera he possesses. He slipshods through like a roller coaster  and goes from one place to the next without missing a beat. He juggles nine  characters in the air with ease like some sort of balancing act star. I  have not seen the video,I hope to own a DVD player and the DVD of this film  some time soon(Christmas,hint,hint). But the film itself is something else  and really moved me. The Cruise-Robards relationship breaks down into a  horrifyingly real scene at a deathbed which had me realize what fragility  there is in time on Earth and how I needed to see my dad more often,no  matter how much of a jerk he is(I don't call him jerk-network censor).  Magnolia is indescribably,heartbreakingly,fast-paced brilliant.
