The image quality on this blu ray is superb.
The vivid imagery really comes to life and the sound wraps around you superbly.
You will not be dissapointed with the picture quality as you will pick out detail you have never seen before even if you have watched the dvd on an upconverting player many times as I have. I watch on a 2011 model 1080p plasma and this is one of the most eye popping movies I have watched.

The collector extras are great fun too.
A decent book with heavy glossy pages full of colour photos.
Interesting reproduction letters.

The movie extras are extended from the original dvd release. You actually get a very brief but insightful glimpse into Roald Dahl's life as a writer. Fun pencil case with pencils and eraser to put on a shelf or share with your little ones.

This is a film my family watches a couple of times a year.
We now have a renewed interest as we can catch nuances you just cannot see via dvd.
I hope you and your family enjoy this movie on blu ray and the fun extras in the collectors edition just as much as I and my family do.
