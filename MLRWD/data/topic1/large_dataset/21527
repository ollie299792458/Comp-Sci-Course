The cover illustration, like most hack work, doesn't bear looking at, because whoever produced it had obviously never watched the film. Ah, well ...
The film is really very good ... I need not decribe it; it's easy to understand. One of the most remarkable features of the film is the female lead, who, not only does she not wear "issue ingenue" clothing, she even fails to break a heel off a stiletto shoe (she wears sensible outdoor work boots of excellent quality) while fleeing from the monster. Unheard of! She is a scientist, and manages to get through the entire film without batting her eyelashes at Kevin Bacon.
Bacon himself plays his part flawlessly ... what else is there to say?
The cast is further expanded by the two survivalists, Michael Gross and Reba McEntyre, who play their parts with &eacute;lan, and have a lot of fun (yeah, you can tell).
The film is kept light, but not tongue-in-cheek. Watch it; it's fun, and yes, even a film this light-hearted can give you a couple of scares.
