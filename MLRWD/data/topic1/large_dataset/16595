I never had the chance to catch this show when it was running on TV back in the late 70's and early 80's, but I always knew it as a reference of sitcoms I caught on TV from my generation on: Friends and Seinfeld for example. I have found this show really, really funny and I do believe it was way ahead of its time with the jokes and sex references. It's also so easy to fall in love with the main characters: Jack Tripper was by far the captain of the boat but without the clever Janet and the beautiful and naive Chrissy, he could've not made it. Unfortunely, to me Chrissy's character suffers a negative change in this season. In the first two seasons, Chrissy's character (played by the gorgeous Suzanne Summers) was a cute, charming and even naive girl with a personality of her own... that was exactly the charm of this character. But in season 3, I can see that she became a dumb, needless girl on the show (even for Chrissy's standards) with no presence of her own when she appears with the rest of te cast and that's sad because Chrissy's character was one of the main reasons for many men (myself included) to watch this show but not for her beauty alone but also for her comments, her thoughts and her interaction with the rest. And I must point out why on earth she appeared on most of the episodes with the same hair style. I don't know if the producers were trying to hide something that had happened to Suzanne back in those days but that flat hairdo and the pony tail on the side gets boring after a while. Don't get me wrong, Suzanne Summers looks gorgeous no matter how her hair looks like but, with her gorgeous hair they could've made many variations on her character.

Now, I'm just half way convinced with this season but I'm planning to keep on getting the ones where Chrissy's character appears. I'm not planning on getting the seasons where she was vanished form the show... I'm just not interested in those.
