I received this DVD from my publisher, and I was slated to write a review of it. However, the publication in question went defunct, shuttering my column "Am&eacute;lie's Retro Hell." I still feel I owe the creators and distributors of this fun cartoon at least a mini-review for the free DVD (karma being what it is), so here it is:

In the late 1960s, Channel 11 KTTV (Los Angeles) would run ads ballyhooing the broadcast of MAD MONSTER PARTY some 2-3 weeks before Halloween. Being little kids, my sisters, friends, and I would get all whipped up into a frenzy, looking forward to the broadcast. It was usually aired early Sunday afternoons after Halloween, which was good for the post-holiday/sugar-rush letdown. How cool to have my favorite holiday extended by another couple of days, affording us the opportunity to scarf down the dregs of our pillowcases (usually the smarties candy necklaces, Sugarbabies, and Jujubes) while we watched animated versions of our favorite model kit heroes: Frankie, Wolfie, Mummy, The Hunchback, The Invisible Man, etc. The all-inclusive creature character roster converged for the big Mad Monster shebang, which included poison punch for Dr. Jekyl, a rock band (didn't every animated series or non-Disney movie have a rock band by then?) that didn't play "Monster Mash," and the voices of Phyllis Diller (not scary, but fun) and Boris Karloff (not scary to boomer kids since he narrated "The Grinch"). What was not to love for 8 and 9-year-olds everywhere?

Loveloveloved it then, and I love it now, especially since I have recently learned that the script was cowritten by the great Forrest J. Ackerman (a personal aquaintance for whom I retain great fondness) and MAD Magazine's Harvey Kurtzman. If you love Rankin-Bass cheese and want to retain some of the more crimson glow of your childhood, MAD MONSTER PARTY is a must for your video collection. Buy it here and buy it now!  (Okay, now my karma and my conscience are clear. Thank you, Anchor Bay!)
