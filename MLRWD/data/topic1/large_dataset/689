Save your money.  This was the worst movie I have ever seen.  I almost threw it in the trash can after I had finished the painful task of watching it!  The plot, if there is one, keeps changing.  The actors can't act.  The actions that the actors take have little in common with the dialogue.  Speaking of dialogue, the movie is in Mandarin, which is ok, and it is dubbed in English, which is great.  It also has English subtitles, which I find useful.  But, it is like watching three movies at once because I suppose the actions make sense if you can understand Mandarin, but the actions do not match the English that was added on, and the spoken English doesn't match the English subtitles.  You also have cartoonish, high pitched, English dubbing that does not match the character who is supposed to be speaking, so when a General tries to sound tough he sounds more like a whiner.

Spoiler info follows, so if you are thinking about buying it don't read any more. Plot: lets surrender, no lets defend, no lets attack, no lets defend, no lets surrender; girl meets hero, they fall in love, they escape from peril together, girl gets caught by bad-guy-good-guy-bad-guy-good-guy king, girl gets her vocal cords ripped out by bad-guy-good-guy-bad-guy king, girl gets imprisoned in an underground cell, hero floods city to defeat good-guys-bad-guys-good-guys, then goes to look for his girl, girl drowns before the hero can save her because she can't yell because the good-guy-bad-guy-good-guy-bad-guy king had her vocal cords ripped out: end: hero walks away and the good-guy-bad-guy-good-guy-bad-guy king is still around.  Movie ends.  Yech!
