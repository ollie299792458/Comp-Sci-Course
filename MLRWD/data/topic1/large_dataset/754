The movie shows, in a good sense of humor, our reality today. Besides de "dumb" thing about "outsourcing" our jobs to overseas, the Coporations CEO's dont see how dangerous are they putting our country in a risk of financially caos... China is already the owner of our country... and soon of the whole world... why? because of those American corporations! They can not see that the can have a "cheaper labor" and more "profits", but they can not see or feel, yet,the impact of this mistake they are making. They think profits will come without "QUALITY" been on Customer Services (agents with strong accents)and produts. The have not learned the lesson with the "Made in China" products for babies and kids with toxins that killed some of them? What about thinking that by making american products in China we are "feeding" our enemies or their people own enemy by supporting their Communism system and their cuelties with no Human Rights respect. So, we first fight against COmmunism against Cuba, Russia, Venezuela, North Korea, etc... and we go to wars to free people from those dictadors and systems, but at the same time we are sending our jobs to China.... we are helping them to dominate soon, the world...!

BUILD AMERICA!
BUY AMERICA!

Ai thinks this should be said to all AMERICAN people. But ony MADE IN USA products, starting from your cars. FORD, CHEVROLET, DODGE are still the best cars in the world and they will soon all been MADE IN USA no more in Mexico or wherever...
If you wanna still making your products our of USA, at least send to our friend countries, that share te same ideals like most countries in Latin and South America!

Pass on...

Thank You!
