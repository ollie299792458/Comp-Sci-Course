I've seen the DVD version and found that the cut scenes hold
most of the coherency of the movie: establishing the relation-
ship between "Elle" and "Rep.Victoria Rudd" especially.
There is really a much better version of this movie in your hands;
if I had the equipment, I'd re-edit it from DVD.  I
may do my own "Cut" for myself from the VHS copy when it arrives.
I needed to see "LEGALLY BLONDE" to follow the story line
and references to it(I bought "L.B.2" for Sally Field's (and
Bob Newhart's) parts, not because I had seen "L.B."; but I
felt that a lot of the story still wasn't there in the
theater version.  It IS a good, light summer sequel (aside
from my Sally Field prejudice) but it's better if you watch
the "cut scenes" compilation and think them into their proper
places between watching the released edition cuts.
Sally Field and Bob Newhart are delights anytime; Sally as the
heavy is not to be missed with her "Margaret Hamilton Under-
tones" from "The Wizard of Oz"...
