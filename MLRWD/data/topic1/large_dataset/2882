When buying silent movies, it really is true: you shouldn't be fooled by cheap imitations.  It's easy for fly-by-night companies to release cheap copies of copyright-free films, but what do you get?  You get terrible visual quality, no score (or worse, a dreadful score composed of random copyright-free music), and missing or disordered footage.

Image's Ultimate Edition of "The Phantom of the Opera," on the other hand, contains two versions of the film (the original and the more commonly seen 1929 re-release), appropriate soundtrack options, commentaries, high visual quality (on the restored 1929 version), and beautiful restoration of the famous color sequences.  Carl Davis, composer of so many great silent film scores, has done marvelous work for this film as well.  All of these qualities come together in this edition to make watching "The Phantom of the Opera" an engrossing, thrilling experience once more, just as it must have been for original audiences.
