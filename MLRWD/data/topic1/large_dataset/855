I bought these DVDs following a special request from my niece and nephew (ages 10 and 11) who loved the part one of the series, even though they were born so many years after it aired, and really in a different era... Personally, I remember the series as a child, and am pleased that the children of today can find as much pleasure in it now. The children said that they loved learning about real things that happened (one of them took a DVD to a social studies class where they were learning about the events in one of the episodes and got permission to show it to the classmates, who are no enthusiastic about The Time Tunnel themselves...). The visual effects might be a bit outdated for what we are used to today, and the transitions from movie bits (which were used to cut on the cost of production rather than shooting full scope events from scratch--call it TV recycling...not a bad idea) a bit choppy; but overall, the show still holds.
One question I remember asking as a child and which my nephew asked, as well, was "how come the time tunnel staff can send and bring back so many people and stuff and things but Tony and his friend are always tumbling in the infinite corridors of time?..."
From the mouth of babes...
