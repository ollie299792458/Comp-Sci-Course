This DVD collection includes two disks- the first has the movie in widescreen, the second in full screen.  Each disk has some of the same extras, such as musical highlights and a "making of..." sort of documentary.  
Some of the more interesting points are the "Seasonal Walk Along Portobello Road."  This featurette shows how they marked the passage of a year within the move with William Thakkard's (Hugh Grant)walk along the market-filled road.  
A quite cute bit is the "Hugh Grant's Film Tips."  This is just a light look at his recommendations such as not allowing your parents to your film set. 
All this being said, this is a good movie.  I didn't like it much the first time I saw it- Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) just came across as very selfish and uncaring, which she is.  However, upon further viewings, I have come to empathize with her more, and I like the character more.  The supporting cast is also great.  You come away really rooting for and liking William.
