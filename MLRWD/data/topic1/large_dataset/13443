I think this is Scorsese's best film by far and great as it is I think Bernard Hermann's score takes it to another level. Travis Bickle's decline into morbid social impotence is the most deftly drawn example of alienation ever put on the screen. Straight out of Vietnam, Travis struggles to connect with the social world around him. This it seems was not an uncommon occurance for most veterans of the Vietnam war, who were often trained with one set of men, sent over to Vietnam with a different set of men and then sent into battle with yet another group of men. This constant uprooting of company alligences meant that many veterans of that war found it difficult to form lasting bonds with their comrades in arms and as such had to suffer much of their post-war psychological trauma alone. The U.S. army has since learnt from its mistakes and now makes sure all its soldiers form a career-long bond with the companies they were initially trained with.
In 'Taxi Driver' Travis's social and personal frustrations become ever more exacerbated as the movie continues, until eventually all the tension is released in the final shoot-out scene. Accepting his incompetance in everyday relationships, Travis sees that the only way he can give meaning to his life is by identifying with a Christ-like mission to save a young prostitute. He ultimately fails in his attempt to deify himself as he runs out of bullets. It is this twist of fate which gives him a second shot at life, a shot that I believe the final scene attests to.
Also, against popular opinion, I think the desaturation was a good idea. It gives that scene a gritty, documentary-style look, rather than a full-blooded gore fest which would have run the risk of making the scene look like a B-movie horror.
