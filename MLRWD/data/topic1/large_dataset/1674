It's pretty obvious that the theater of war of this film is Northern Italy.  Apart from the major players of the game (The French and the Imperials (Holy Roman Empire/Spanish), there were lot's minor players like the Venetians, the Pope, the Milanese, the

Florentines etc, etc, etc.  Plenty of employers for your average Swiss or Landsknecht entrepeneur.  The Renaissance was definitely the age of the warrior entrepeneur.  The only things that seemed out of place was the name Hawkwood(who died in 1394) and those anachronistic cannon trails on the town walls which are straight out of the eighteenth/nineteenth centuries.  You can tell it's pretty close to the Reformation because "the Cardinal" is full of notions of faith that could get you burned for heresy like divine revelation. Just ask Joan of Arc.  Oh and the town only got what they asked for.  The conventional fate of towns that resisted and forced the attacking army to storm it was the sacking of it's life(and burning.) That was a time honored convention from the time of Alexander until the Napoleonic Wars.  Assault was expensive in time, money and lives.  That's why Arnulfini used mercenaries as assault troops and not his own men.  Less people to pay afterwards and they have more incentive to succeed.  The only anachronism was that he reneged on his deal.  Smart towns usually knew when it was time to surrender and it was before the assault.  All in all a wonderful depiction of the time.  This film (plus The Last Valley) show why after the Thirty Years War that rulers decided it was much to their interest to keep standing professional armies to keep entire kingdoms from being laid waste.
