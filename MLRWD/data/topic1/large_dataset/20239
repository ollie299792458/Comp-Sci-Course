One of the first reviews here is a desperate Tamberg scrambling for shreds of credibility since this dvd smashes all the lies of the Church to pieces. Just like law enforcement, these people who supposedly "protect and serve" are actually the predators of society. The very people we are told to put our trust of our children with are the biggest hypocrites and liars that have a "code of silence" and "protect our own" mentality that is destroying America as we know it.

Watch in horror as Cardinals and Bishops take the witness stand and struggle to make eye contact with anyone while trying to evade the truth and pass the blame to others while shifting around pediphiles to various cities once they are found out where ever they are currently at. Instead of putting these child rapists in exile (or better yet, in jail) they not only keep them employed within the church ranks - they pay for it!! All that money in the collection plate you give - watch as the numbers grow in the billions of dollars in payouts since almost 1 in 10 clergy members in certain areas end up being sexual abusers. no wonder the state of the Church is in the crisis it is in with these hypocrites in charge. It is just like George Bush being in charge of the Catholic Church. Nothing but double talk, evasive speech and an utter disregard for what their actions do to innocent people in their wake of betrayal to our nation.
