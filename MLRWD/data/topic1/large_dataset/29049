I used to own the Winsor Pilates series, but for some reason was never crazy about it, it literally sat on my shelf for years before I gave in and sold it on eBay.  This was about six months ago, and since then I've been on a "quest" to find what I would find to be the "ultimate" pilates DVD, or even series of DVD's, on the market.  After ordering a couple of DVD's I found to be just mediocre, I finally decided to give this one a shot.  At first I admit to being hesitant, as I've never really had anything against Denise Austin but wasn't a huge fan, either.

Well, let me just say that I was pleased to find everything I'd been looking for in "Hit the Spot" - first of all, it's visually gorgeous, with different backdrops to coincide with the various segments; an enthusiastic, but not overwhelmingly annoying Denise Austin coaching and motivating you every step of the way (her constant comments of "think of how great you'll look in those shorts" hold very true in my situation, as I am not out to lose weight per se but have a LOT of toning to do); and, finally, 10-minute segments that work each part of the body that you can either do all together, seperately, etc., all time permitting and tailored to fit one's own workout preferences.  Done correctly, you really feel this effective workout without being in unecessary pain as a result, unlike other workouts I've used.

I've only used this DVD a couple of times but this is the first time in a very long time that I actually look forward to the next time I will be working out - I plan to do a half hour or forty minutes worth of segments at least three times a week, and see what happens from there.  After all, in answer to Denise's question yes, I really do want to look good in my shorts this summer!
