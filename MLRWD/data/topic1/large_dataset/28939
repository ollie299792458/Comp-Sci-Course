Having been a previous fan of the books I was initially disappointed by the changes made to the story. But as with repeated viewings I realized that if you just put the book on film it would have been a VERY boring anticlimactic mess of a film(Nothing against the book, I love it. But books and film are 2 totally different medians) And the story isn't all that changed(No more then the LOTR), yes there are a lot of changes but most of them were for the better or just plain neutral. Scenes like the castle attack were necessary to add something to the middle of the film and it really matures the series, raising the stakes(The Narnians can actually lose!) and making it much for convincing as a real place. I really liked how they portrayed the Telmarines, they were very convincing as a civilization. And the actor for Miraz was amazing!
 There are some changes that I hate such as the Caspian-Susan romance and Peter's spoiled brat attitude, though they make some scenes unpleasent the do not ruin the film for me.

Overall it's not as good of an adaptation as LWW but it's still a great film in it's own right.
