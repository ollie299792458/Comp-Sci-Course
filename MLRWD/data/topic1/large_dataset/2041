I have never been a Matt  Damon fan. For some reason, he just never blipped on my radar screen until I saw The Bourne Identity in the theaters two years ago. My new found crush for him has now been solidified with The Bourne Supremacy. I realized he is such a good actor who can play an action character with humanity and be athletic enough to pull off the action moves with ease.

I think the Bourne series overall is a smart intelligent piece of filmmaking with a solid screenplay and razor sharp caliber actors. Cooper and especially Cox are my favorite. I enjoy the relationship between Bourne and Marie. Call me a romantic mush but how could they not have went with the alternative ending. The theatrical ending never made sense to me. It came off stiff and implausible. Bourne has been searching the globe for the woman he loves. When they finally reunite, they act as if they're old friends catching up, giving each other nice generic hugs. The alternative ending makes more sense. The raw passion and hunger they feel for each other comes through. It marks the incredible ordeal they've both endured. He was so incredible in that screen, he really acted a man who wanted to devour his woman.

For those who are not romantic like me, the Bourne Identity mainly focuses on the spy thriller that is heavily character driven and it will not disappoint. If they continue to make more films I hope that stick to the commitment of making a great screenplay with a director who can pull it off and not turn the series into garbage like James Bond.
