Heidi (Shirley Temples) has spent the first few years of her life with her black-hearted and bossy aunt Dete, for her parents died when she was an infant. The story begins when Dete finds a job in Frankfurt, and dumps Heide off on Adolf Cramer's doorstep. Though he is her granfather, she has never known him, and it takes a while for the cranky old man to get used to her. But once Heide - with her charming ways - has won a place in his heart, she is there to stay. And wether she is exploring the mountains with Peter - the "goat general" - helping to milk the goats,  gather fire wood, or learning to read, she exhibits uniform cheerfulness, for the mountains, and her grandfather's hut, have become her home. Heidi's love for the Lord even bring her grandfather to ask forgiveness - and to forgive those who in the past he had been at emnity with. I love the part where they are at Church and the congregation sings "Holy, Holy, Holy Lord" together. It sent chills down my spine the first time I heard it. Just when things are getting too good to be true, the worst happens:the miserly, manipulative Aunt Dete comes to call, and snatches Heide away. Arriving in Frankfurt, Dete leaves Heide to be the companion of the rich and sickly Klara Sesemaan, whose governess happens to be none other than Frauline Rottenmiar, who becomes convinced that Heidi is bad news as she sees Klara getting well because of her. Meanwhile, Adolf Cramer has come in search of his little grandaughter, little knowing that Klara's father has determined to adopt her when he finds that Klara can walk again for the first time since her fall. As for Frauline Rottenmire, well . . . A must see video for everyone who has read and loved the book, or for those just finding out about this big-hearted, facinating little girl.
