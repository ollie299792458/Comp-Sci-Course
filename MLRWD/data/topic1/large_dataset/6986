I agree with many of the comments in the four star reviews. There's a problem with humor, and that is most people consider their opinions absolute. They aren't. What's funny to a brilliant 30 year old is not the same as what's amusing to a sub-normal 5 year old. Different types of people, different humor: There is no absolute standard.

Lower ratings here compare Martin to Peter Sellars, in the sense that Sellars did a perfect job -- that any performance needs to match his. That's really quite beside the point. What's happening is Sellars created a character that, like Sherlock Holmes, appears to have staying power. Martin demonstrated the potential. Someone else will need to be very, very good indeed to create a plausible alternative to what Martin's created.

He and John Cleese are better than the originals. The orginals were Keystone Cops: superficial, frenetic. It's amusing that some reviewers in Rotten Tomatoes said Martin and Cleese were just stringing together slapstick moments. Not at all. Martin and Cleese added perspective and continuity. Emphasized the successes and created a reality that was never there in the often tedious originals.

Martin and Cleese are not junior in their profession. They didn't make this movie because they were forced to, but because they had something to say. They succeeded.
