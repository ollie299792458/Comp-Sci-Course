When I say genuinely funny, I mean it is believable. Most main-stream comedy nowadays are full of unbelievable story line, nudity, and plenty of vulgar; which have there place in comedy of course. But Cedar Rapids is a believable, real world type of comedy that will make you feel good, with some laughter here and there. This movie reminded of the real-world, not the tv show, but the world that we live in.

The main character (Ed Helms) is an innocent, all-thing-is-good guy who is both naive and ignorant. As he meet new friends and explore a different world, he comes to understand that there are evil, corruption, infidelity, and greed in this world. It's a classic story of a boy growing up to see the world as it truly is, but the boy is already grown up. Is it a cliche? Yes, but with thousands of years of story telling, everything is a cliche in my books.

I found that, now that I am 20, I like these type of movies rather than raunchy comedies such as American Pie, Superbad, etc. I've got to taste what the real world is like; it's not a fantasy land where your parents take care of you, and everything is provided for, world is full of people who are there to stop you, and there are few friends that will stick by you no matter what-ultimately, how your life turns out is all up to you. Knowing this I enjoyed Cedar Rapids a lot, I don't think I would have enjoyed this movie if I saw this during my high school years.

Over all, great, heartfelt movie that will make you both laugh and smile.
