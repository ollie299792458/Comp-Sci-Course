'The Black Stallion' (executive producer Francis Ford Coppola) is one of the most underrated films of the last three decades and remains one of the best family pictures ever made. I first saw the movie when I was a kid and bought the DVD when it came available in 1998 but after upgrading to a Hi-Def TV last year (and recently Blu-ray) it became all too obvious that this transfer does not do the film justice. Compared to other DVDs in my collection the picture is simply sub-par as viewed on my 50" plasma (via an up-converting player) and the 2.0 Dolby surround track lacks clarity and depth. Not to mention that there are no extras of any kind (documentary, voice over tracks, etc.) included in the DVD.

A movie of this caliber deserves a first rate re-master to DVD/Blu-ray and with plenty of examples of high-quality transfers of films from the late '70s and early '80s there is no reason a wonderful film like 'The Black Stallion' can't be re-introduced to a new generation via the wonderful Blu-ray format. Come on Criterion get off your butts!
