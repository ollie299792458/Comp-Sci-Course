This movie is action packed fun and good but like all movies, plenty of bloopers.I just
want to write about the last part of the movie in which the two trains collide.
The whole accident was a blooper! If you playback the movie slowly, you can tell that
the two locomotives of the passenger train already derailed just before hitting the
freight train. This caused the freight train's first locomotive to hit the passenger
train's locomotive from the side rather than "Head on" as it was supposed to be.
This made the whole collision look different. Even though the accident looked very
realistic and spectacular, it was not done correctly. If you know of any movies
that have well made "Head on" collisions, reply me cause up till now, I haven't seen any.
There is a show called "Movie Magic" of which gave detail about how the collision was made.
I can't find anything about this show on the internet. If you know in what channel
they show it, please write!
