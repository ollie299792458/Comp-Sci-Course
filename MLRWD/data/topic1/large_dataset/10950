In '59 when this movie first came out, I was the fastest draw on my street at the age of seven in El Paso, Tx.
I was the proud owner of a Mattel double holster, Fanner 50 gun set (and, it shot "real" plastic bullets!). My brother was old enough to drive, and so one summer night we went to see Rio Bravo at The Bordertown Drive-in Theatre. Even the front of the screen that faced Montana street, had cowboys on horses looking up at jets flying over head (due to Biggs Air Force Base). And, what a great time to be living there, Marty Robbins had just put us on the map with the release of "El Paso". We, at least in my mind, were the Cowboy Capital of the world...... dag nabbit!!!(it's in the movie).
Beautifully filmed, great cast, fabulous music by the king of movie soundtracks, Dimitri Tiomkin... what more can you ask?
I purchased this movie for an old friend who one night made the statement that, this is her favorite western of all time, and she can still remember seeing this at the drive-in! Maybe they were parked next to us!). Go figure.
Buy this movie if you've never seen it, and experience the magic of the old west through one of the best of the western classics of the 1950's.
