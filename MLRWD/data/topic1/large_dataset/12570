In the TV series, what you've got is something of a linear main-plot with a lot of sub- and mini-plots interwoven. And those plots revolve around the humor and comedy, kind of like the plot revolves around the sex in an x-rated movie-not that I would know, but just based on what I've heard. Anyway, this movie does not reflect this strip cartoon structure, which is actually the kind of material that Matt Groening started off doing. Anybody remember Life Is Hell comics? So with The simpsons movie what you've got is the reverse: more of a dominant main linear plot, with the comedy revolving around it much more than what you've got in the TV series. And this makes sense for a feature-length film, otherwise why make one, right?
Also, remember the film The Adams Family? A lot of people got caught up on the fact that it seemed choppy. It seemed choppy because they tried to do a strip cartoon format (TAF started off as a strip cartoon) with a full-length feature. It works fine for something short, like say 30 minutes or under, but can tire and confuse the audience if they get a solid hour and a half of it, and I think the makers of this film took that into consideration as they put together a film somewhat more plot-driven than its TV counterpart.
In a nutshell, they had to slow things down a little bit in order to work in a story line that was clear enough to keep the audience focused on the movie for the entire time. But there's a lot that's funny in this movie, typical Simpson's stuff, along with one or two things that they probably wouldn't even put on prime time. Plus it's just cool to see a movie and have it be The Simpsons.
