I heard about this show through NSFW, a podcast, on the TWIT.TV network. I've been looking forward to it since I heard about it and after watching the first show I have been really impressed. The first episode has to spend a good amount of time setting up the how and why of zombies. The normal if you shoot them in the head they are dead and other story details. They do a fabulous job of creating a rich scene to see details in. Watching the first episode a second time allowed me to see some cool details I originally missed.

I'm looking forward to more episodes and I've been impressed with the massive scenery that has been created for the scenes (or maybe its computer generated, I cannot tell if it is). Either way, I'm looking forward to the next episode when I get Rookered. You should get Rooker rocked too by Michael Rooker. Fabulous Actor.

In addition, I wish people would review the show and not their bad internet connection. Those 1 or 2 stars really aren't deserved by the show. If you are having problems with viewing the shows then talk to Amazon Support instead of giving a poor rating to a show (or any product for that matter) that cannot control your computer, the internet or amazon's video.
