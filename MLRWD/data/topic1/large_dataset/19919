I used to be an avid Tae bo user and huge Billy Banks fan. I found it really helped me loose weight, improve my cradiovascular health, and improve my mood overall. Due to the fact I don't have a VCR I decided to look up DVD's and decided on this one. I thought that I could just pass through this workout with flying colors due to the fact I'm a guy and used Tae bo and were fairly familiar with the moves, boy was I wrong! This workout is very intense, it's about on par with the Advanced 2 tape, maybe a little less intense. It was so bad that I had to take 3 minute breaks between each set workout. By the end of it, I was drenched in sweat. There are parts of this workout where your arms feel like they are on fire. I am sure the more I do it, the easier it will become and am looking forward to the benefits to my health. Billy is very motivational in this video and the decor is the nicest of any Tae bo tape I've seen although the music is lacking in this one. The only negative is that there is no pre stretch, no floor ab and butt work and a very short post stretch (Tai Chi). But overall, a sufficient workout for Tae bo fans.
