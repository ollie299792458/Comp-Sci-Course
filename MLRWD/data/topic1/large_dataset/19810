This movie is loaded with kilos of negative energy: scenes of fights and brawls between Skins and Chinese are really scary because it's real violence, not the cranberry juice sprinkled violence of action movies. All three main characters (Hando, his buddy Davey and doll-faced brat Gabriela) are hard to sympathize with: they are what they are and that's it. Speaking of "love triangle" seriously would be wrong in this film - yes, something like that is present here to move the film along, although what characters express can hardly be called love. And maybe something is wrong with my VCR, but I haven't noticed any "blue haze" the movie is supposed to be shot in, simply that's how the movies looked in 1993.
Go search for charismatic Crowe somewhere else - in Romper Stomper he is as attractive as a rabid dog, although his character is sound of body and (relatively) of mind, he's brutal and haughty, but leader in him you can sense from afar (the saunter, the squint, the voice). Funny though, when Hando says, "I want revenge", you'll see Maximus Decimus raising his head in defiance, "I'll have my revenge in this life or next". That only proves Crowe not to be some Aussie upstart, but a person whose talent has remained integral for 10 years.
In general, it's a movie to watch for those curious how R Crowe was starting his career, as well as to find out that such far and peaceful country as Australia has its racial problems. Otherwise, it's not an entertaining spectacle: leaves you with unpleasant aftertaste and your faith in human beings and their ability to live in peace strongly undermined.
