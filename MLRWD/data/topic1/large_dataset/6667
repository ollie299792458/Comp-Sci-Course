Fans of mainstream cinema will hate this. They will no doubt fail to enjoy it for what it is: f***ing insane!! TCNG is far from a horrible film. It has insane performances and in-jokes only a fan of this series would love (remember the classic "Haven't you people ever heard of pizza?!" line from part 3? Well guess what one of the cannibals stops off to pick up for dinner while Renee is tied up in the trunk.) and there's also a decent dose of social commentary. Most of these elements go over the heads of those who are on their high horses and fail to enjoy the film. TCNG gets slammed by original Chainsaw purists who like to pat themselves on the back for having the good taste to appreciate art, and fans of the Chainsaw remake who claim that one for their own (7th Heaven fans now watch these great ol' Chainsaw flicks and often fail to "get" them), and those who hate B movies have been drawn to this one by the inclusion of two mainstream stars. None of these folks are amused. The rest of us who enjoy this movie will no doubt find themselves outside of these "in-crowds", but I wouldn't have it any other way. TCNG is a cult gem and one of the weirdest damn movies out there. There's a lot going on in this movie that needs to be seen to be believed. Matt is most effective in his role and gives one of the most insane performances EVER. Are you looking for an unusual flick to bend your mind around? You can't beat this combo of satirical elements, crazed characters, humor, and insanity. It's very fun stuff if you aren't too pretentious to have a good time with it.
