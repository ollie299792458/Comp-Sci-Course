Yes, it is science fiction that drives the plot of this powerful and often mind bending film. But it is the magnificant performances of the three main cast members that make me say absolutely see this movie. When I watched Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt create their characters, Willis the sane man who everyone (eventually even himself) believes is crazy, and Pitt the insane man who everyone (including himself) believes is a genius, my thought while I watched the story unfold was "what brilliant acting!" But later, when the movie ended and the dust settled in my mind, I realized that the performance of Madeleine Stowe far eclipsed even those of the other great actors. Her performance was so incredibly real as the psychiatrist who was trying to put together the pieces of the time paradox puzzle - first terrified of Willis and trying to convince him that he was crazy and needed help, and then trying harder to convince him that he was not crazy and they all needed HIS help - her performance was so real that during the movie, I never even considered the possibility that she was acting! It wasn't till the movie was over that I realized how perfect a job she had actually done. Yes, 5 stars for 12 monkeys - but the 5th star belongs to Madeleine Stowe.
