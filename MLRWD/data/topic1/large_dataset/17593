I delayed purchasing this title on Blu-ray for two reasons - waiting to see if it would be released in the UK as a region B or region free issue and concern about the many reviews criticising the video and sound quality.

In the end, I gave up waiting for a UK release and chose to ignore the negative reviews and judge for myself.

All I can say is that both video and sound quality are very good. I can only assume that those who criticise this Blu-ray title either have deficiencies with their home cinema equipment or have very unrealistic expectations.

Using a Pioneer BDP-LX71 Blu-ray player connected to a Pioneer PDP-LX5090 50 inch 1080p plasma the picture is sharp, with excellent black depth and detail. Grain was very rarely visible and the whole transfer is impressive when compared to the DVD release which I also have. It's widescreen too. The picture is more grainy than some of the best Blu-ray releases when paused however.

With the HD soundtrack playing through a Dali Helicon 5 channel speaker set-up via Primare electronics, I never thought it was anything other than excellent. I never noticed the problem of unclear voices reported by some others.

Another notable plus is the packaging. The five discs, all of which are easily individually accessible, are accommodated within a standard size and thickness Blu-ray case. Why can't all box sets be packaged this way?

The one big negative is the advertisement for the Star Trek Blu-ray release at the start of the first disc - this appears to disable all player transport functions to defeat any attempt to skip or fast forward through it. Extremely annoying!

AND.....WHY IS IT REGION CODED AND NOT REGION FREE???? I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW THE JUSTIFICATION.
