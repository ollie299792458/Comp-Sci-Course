I read all the reviews and decided to purchase the Schwarzkopf and Te Kenawa (Covenant Garden)versions. I am learning more and more that great operas need to be viewed in many formats and time frames and I am so glad I did not just choose one (I have 4 La Bohemes and 3 Carmens). How can I choose - I rate both versions as perfection. Strauss loved the female voice and it is worth it just for the 3 Soprano aria in Act III. I found the role of Octavian played by a female a little disconcerting....but he needed that boyish voice I guess. First Schwarzkopf and the other divas have voices from heaven....Schwarzkopf has a unique quality in her voice which is almost ethereal. I liked the movie version because of glorious Technicolor, the Barron was so much more a crude individual masquerading as aristocracy and a better comedic actor and the 3 sopranos were perfectly matched - perhaps the greatest match possible. I ignored the miming and lip syncing in the movie version only because I was having such a great time. Obviously in the 1985 Covent Garden version the audio and video quality was better as was the blend of orchestration and voice. My recommendation is to get both versions and have a great time.
