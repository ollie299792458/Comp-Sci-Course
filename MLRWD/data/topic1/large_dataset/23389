Both films are beautifully restored and presented in letterbox format.  The colors, the photography, especially the night shooting in "Firecreek" are excellent.  Of the two, "Firecreek" is the standout.  "Firecreek" is a simple "High Noon" story with cowardly townspeople unwilling to take a stand against a gang of invading outlaws.  Henry Fonda plays a fine hangdog villain and gang boss and James Stewart is the reluctant hero faced with his own moral and spiritual crisis.  "Firecreek" lacks the taught script and perfect pacing of "High Noon", but it's also less manipulative and contains more careful character development.  I've always thought "High Noon" was too political for its own good.  No worries of that here.  This is just a good western with solid opposing characters who must have it out.  The weaker film of the set is "The Cheyenne Social Club".  It is quite dated, silly, corny, cute and sexist in that old fashioned Hollywood way.  The ladies are lovely and busty prostitutes with hearts of gold.  James Stewart plays the plain cowhand who is thrust into pimpdom after his deceased brother leaves him a bordello as part of his estate.  Henry Fonda is very amusing as Stewart's close friend.  Fonda has less lines but always seems to get the laugh just by cracking a nut, grinning or twinkling his eyes.  This movie is pleasant and diverting and delivers humor and action in regular doses, but it is otherwise forgettable.
