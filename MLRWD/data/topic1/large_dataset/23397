The reason this film gets five stars even though it's not a great movie is because it gives almost exactly what you expect from the title and it fulfills most of its' plot 'mysteries' by the end which is an accomplishment for a movie with the disposition that this one has.  Here is a movie so relaxed and filled with under the radar intellect that you just have to sit back and appreciate that someone could come up with such a lame brained idea, inject so much energy, and throw in some simple plot twists.  Most mainstream films don't do that these days, you see  the trailer and you know a certain person is going to be in it so you expect to laugh and most people follow along just to feel like they didn't waste their time.  In this case I think it delivers, it doesn't deliver brilliantly, but you shouldn't expect brilliance from a film with the title 'Dude, Where's My Car.' Other titles that should indicate that what you're watching isn't going to be brilliant: 'Dumb and Dumber,''Hot Dog: The Movie,' 'Half Baked' etc.  So if you're in the mood for an under the radar kind of humor and casual plot twists then I say go for this one.
