Based on Ruth Rendell's novel A Judgment in Stone, Claude Chabrol's 1995  film is fascinating and disturbing. Illiterate Sandrine Bonnaire joins the  French countryhouse of Jacqueline Bisset and Jean-Pierre Cassell as a maid  and along the way befriends postal clerk Isabelle Huppert. Chabrol's  previous concerns have been about the bourgeoisie exploiting the working  classes but Bisset and her family are nothing but kind to Bonnaire so their  fate seems cruel and unwarranted. Bonnaire's Sophie is meant to be dim  because she eats chocolates and watches TV indiscriminately. We're left to  ponder Huppert's character, who is clearly unbalanced and who leads  Bonnaire astray. Huppert is Chabrol's favourite actress and he rewards her  with big closeups. Her Jeanne is funny, wears plaits and chews gum and is  dangerously irrational. She has a great monologue in profile about the  death of her daughter which she delivers in one take while she drives,  knifing away sentiment yet still conveying the sadness in her Garbo-like  mask face. It's interesting to see the still beautiful Bisset play a mother  of teenage children and to hear her speak in French. You can sense her  pleasure in this role and Chabrol let's us see her great legs. Chabrol is  too subtle a director to manipulate us with the conventions of the  thriller. His soundtrack is bare and the climactic violence leaves us  shocked yet not unsurprised. I like the use of colour in the film -  Bisset's yellow teacups, Huppert's salmon car, Bonnaire's blue jumper with  daisies - and the way the final irony repeats the shock of the murder we  have already witnessed.
