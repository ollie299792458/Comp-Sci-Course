"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" is a rolicking adventure ride  that will please most people.  If ya can't get past the accents, then miss  out on a good movie.
Let me clear a few things up:
1.  "Robin  Hood: Prince of Thieves" was on a tight production schedule.  There  were three (count 'em, three) Robin Hood movies being produced at the same  time, and the one to come out finished first would be the one released in  theatres.  One production gave up and backed out.  That left two Robin Hood  movies - one with Kevin Costner, and one with Patrick Bergen.
2.  Because  of the tight schedule, Kevin Costner's accent was dropped to be  "dubbed over" in post production.  They simply didn't have the  time to worry about accents if they wanted to get the movie finished.
3.  Filming complete, the dubbing was dropped because of lack of time and the  movie was finished.  "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" was released  theatre-wide, whereas the Patrick Bergen version was slated for TV.
Now  that I have the little niggling thing about accents straightened up, get  passed it and watch the movie for what it was intended:  pure  entertainment.
There is plenty of humor - from Little John's river  fighting antics and his wife's bantering, to the Sheriff of Nottingham's  humorous frustrations ("why a spoon, cousin, why not an ax" -  "Because it's dull, you twit, it will hurt more!"), the viewer is  not disappointed.  The entire cast was enjoyable to watch, and the  costuming was superb.  The lush green of the forests (the movie was filmed  in the forests of Nottingham - which proved to be a problem - the airport  is nearby) is captured wonderfully on film, as well as the forest  "homes" Robin Hood and his Merry Men have taken refuge in.
I  rather enjoyed this movie because Kevin Costner's Robin Hood was a Robin  Hood for the 90's.  He was intelligent, witty, and funny, the way we  picture him to be.  Go ahead: rent the movie and lose yourself in a great  adventure flick.
