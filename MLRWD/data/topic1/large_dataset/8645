I have read all the Left Behind books and I love them. One of the best peice of fiction I have read. The first movie was a great as can be expected. I was real impressed and I feel that the actors were made for there role. The second was just as entertaining. Both movies followed the book true.

 BUT THIS...This movie was so bad I almost puked. Nothing followed the book at all. It seemed to jump forward on a couple of plot lines. AND (Spolier alert) THAT IS NOT HOW BRUCE DIED!

I did not see the true authors names nor was Clarence Gilard in the movie...and I can see why!!!

 Also the presedent was a part of the book but that was not the main story. To focas on that (which, I believe, was because of luis Gosset Jr.) was not right to the true book to movie line. If one is going to do the "Left Behind" series into movies DO IT RIGHT!! (See "Harry Potter", "Lord of the Rings","Godfather" etc.) There is still hope for this series as movies as long as the next movie (if there is one) is true to the book.

 This is about the hope and faith in God in the earths last days..not hollywood glamerizing a character who was popular a long time ago.
