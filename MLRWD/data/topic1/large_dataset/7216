In my opinion this was Bruce's best movie based on his fight with (...)Norris...boy was I glad to see him get his hair pulled out and all...originally this movie is called Way of the Dragon and thats the version I suggest all of you to get instead of the american dub Return...even the sound is better on the HK version because the American release is still mono sound (bleh)...you'd figure that Fox would improve the sound on their dvds but this is not the case with Return...However, the best version of the film to get is the Hong Kong Legends dvd release of Way of the Dragon which requires a region free dvd player with PAL converter...this is a PAL (not NTSC as in US over here) dvd...if you got the equipment, this is the ultimate version to get because the sound and picture are all remastered to the fullest possible extent and you'd be surprised of the clarity of the redone picture and the loudness of the sound...nevertheless, this movie shows bruce at his best and in his top form...this film is the only film that Bruce directed entirely by himself and it broke records at the box office at the time in HK...the fight between bruce and norris alone is reason enough to own this masterpiece...this fight used to be tops for me until i saw Drunken Master 2 and of course Fist of Legend (the best kung fu movie ever by the way)...this is the only film I know of where double nunchakus are used and this scene was just magical...story?...pretty simple, Bruce must go to Rome where a sort of family restaurant business is being harassed by some gangsters that want their territory...his mission is to basically help them out...so if you want to see chucky get his (...) beat, this is the movie to get...wanna see bruce's best movie, here it is, but I cant urge you all enough...GET THE HK  OR THE HONG KONG LEGENDS VERSION OF WAY OF THE DRAGON!!!!!While you're at it, get all his other movies too (ENTER, Fist of Fury, Big Boss, Game of Death)...afterall, he's probably the best serious martial artist caught on film.
