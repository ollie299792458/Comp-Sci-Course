I wish I had been able to see this on the big screen at the independent theater nearby. It is a teasingly spun story along the lines of Into The West, only less child focused. To the one who complained about cliches: individually these major themes may be cliches, but to combine them effectively requires art; this is hardly a country song. I agree about the problem with the dialect. I can understand most of the Irish or Scots films, but this one is particularly difficult--probably not watered down for American consumption-- and subtitles would have been helpful, especially for the hard-of-hearing audience. I only felt that the ending was a let-down for a few moments, until I took inventory of the whole film and decided the rationale intentionally left some loose threads inexplicably unaccounted for... Like so much in life, the essence often reveals more of truth than the "evidence" and the conclusion drawn probably more reflects upon the viewer. The pace carefully evolves the plot and characters-- to rush it would have been like gulping down a gourmet meal, and then wondering what the big deal was. The filming and soundtrack supports the premise, providing texture that seamlessly places the viewer alternately between states of mundane reality and mystery. The scenes with any nudity (and there are none that are blatantly so)are seductively supportive of the implied experimentation and adjustment of a feral being to attire other than sealskin. And the scenes in the confessional are delightful, offering restrained, relevant factual character information in a way that evokes a sense of locale and a long, often exasperating history between the priest and "Circus." Take your time and savor this film--set skype, chat and text aside for a bit so it can weave its spell.
