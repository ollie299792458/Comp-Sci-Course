As far as comparisons go, forget U-571 (as 1 example)....it amounts to cheap, derivative Hollywood trash when held up against this true work of art from talented director Wolfgang Petersen.  From start to finish a true masterpiece.  Not only does this movie expertly convey the horror of war, but so much more besides that.  We see the folly of believing one is invincible in the cockiness of the first officer, the Captain's attempting to deal with what he perceives the "wet-behind-the-ears" nature of his crew, and somehow surviving, though just barely, in spite of this.  Not only that, by the time this movie is over, you KNOW the crew.  You feel their pain, their joy, their happiness, their fear, their just plain hoping they won't die hidden beneath their cocky, eager exteriors.  No character is a throw-away, all are developed extremely well, and help to pull you into the story.  The ending is also a superb statement, in that few movies since have duplicated it in terms of sheer bitter irony and pure truth, as opposed to some cliched "ride off into the sunset" piece, something commented on by a previous reviewer, that bears mentioning again.  Well worth your collection as a submarine movie afficianado or merely someone who appreciates GREAT movies.  Das Boot - the real deal
