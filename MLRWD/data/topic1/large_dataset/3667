I played my first copy of this DVD over the years so many times it became scratched so I bought this one.  I listen to the music while I embroider.  I know it sounds silly and why not throw in a CD but it mesmerizes my one cat for some reason or other also - hee hee.

The story has a happy ending despite a rocky road getting there.  I don't want to spoil it for those few who haven't seen it but it's a story of coming of age in New York City while surrounded by dysfunctional friends and family.  "Tony" from the beginning never really truly is one of them despite being raised by a father who is extremely abusive and uncaring in what appears a loveless marriage.

His mother is someone you feel sorry for who is trapped  (or at least FEELS trapped) in this existence.

His older brother Frank escapes and makes his own way so kudos to him.

His friends are pathetic slugs in my opinion. They are the negative side of being raised by what we assume are also dysfunctional families but not having enough where with all to also rise above it.

The bright spot is feisty Stephanie.

Without giving any more of this away if you haven't seen it, buy it for the music and dancing alone or if you, like me, wax nostalgic for the 70s and the fun of that era.
