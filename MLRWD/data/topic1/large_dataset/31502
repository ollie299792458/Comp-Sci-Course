Episode #8 finds Jason reanimated once again and stowed away on a boat full of celebrating teens.  The lead actress is haunted with visions of Jason as a drowning child.  Jason picks the teens off one by one and after killing the ship's captain, the survivors drift into New York...or the Canadian equivilent.  To be fair, their is one scene shot in New York apparently.  The survivors are predictably pared down to two (the lead actress and "lead" actor), who Jason relentlessly pursues in New York, until he is inexplicably killed by a rush of water and transformed back into his firightened youth...or something.  Who knows?

By this point in the series something drastic was needed to keep it afloat.  Instead of slightly varying the formula early on, the producers tried radically altering it with later installments, a bit too late.

This film contains a few humerous scenes: an athletic young man punches Jason over and over until he has no energy remianing.  Jason then punches the guys head off.  Another good scene finds Jason threatened by the street punks in New York.  He simply removes his mask, his frightening face sending them running in fear!

Jason's face has been tweaked again, as well, now white and skull-ish, not as frightening or as cool as VII's face.

By changing the location of the killings, part VIII merely looks like any other slasher film.  The lake was one of the few things that kept the series seperate from others, though at the same time the location change actually helped the picture.  From what I'm told, this entry had a slightly larger budget, but I couldn't tell.
