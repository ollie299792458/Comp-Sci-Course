Another one of Joe Bob Briggs' Monstervision classics, "The Warriors" revolves around the struggle of nine gang members trying to escape the Bronx and reach their home turf of Coney Island. Along the way they run into countless obstacles that threaten to keep them from attaining their goal such as police, subway fires, and rival gangs. Okay, so it's not "Escape from New York" or even "Judgement Night" but it's still pretty good.
The best part of "The Warriors" are the gangs. Every gang has a gimmick such as the Coney Island Warriors of the title who's "colors" consist of stereotypical Native-American garb, i.e. leather vests and pants and even in some cases headdress. Another example are the High Hats who all dress as street mimes. My personal favorites,though,are the Furies who walk the streets in baseball uniforms with their gang logo on the back and ridiculous face paint.
The dialog is quite entertaining at times. The gangs all have their own lingo which doesn't even seem to coincide with the parlance of the times. The film appears to take place in an indeterminate time period and the dialog, as well as the nature of the gangs themselves, would seem to support that theory. I guess the overall consensus is that this could take place in any city at any time. Leaves one to wonder if Walter Hill took his influence straight from Anthony Burgess' "A Clockwork Orange".
"The Warriors" though never truly gripping is still a good movie. Some of its elements over time have devolved into camp but on the whole it has survived pretty well. Unless you really like 70's action films or the "will-they-or-won't-they" theme, though, you might want to skip this one.
