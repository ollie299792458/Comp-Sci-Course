I ordered the version that was made just before 9/11, hoping that some of the scenes that are missing from the earlier TV releases and in the later "Don't Call me Shirley" edition are missing. This disc says 87 minutes, has captions, a clean simple menu, and no annoying ads at the beginning like some DVDs do. Strangely, the copyright warning is in another language.

Some of the missing scenes: * The man who yells "Hi Jack!" (Hijack) is dragged away by cops. * The long discussion between the two kids about how the girl had never gotten married * The co-pilot doesn't ask for nonsensical calculations and then say 49er, 9er, 9er... 9er into the radio. * The pilots notice two jet engines going out while making propeller sounds. And there are more than that. It's a shame that these don't seem to have made it into *any* of the DVD releases.

I'm still giving this movie four stars because of the clean simple DVD release (again, this is the pre-9/11 DVD with the "widescreen" logo at the bottom instead of the top) and the comedic quality of the original movie. "Airplane" is a classic.
