In Grosse Pointe Blank John Cusack plays Martin Blank, a troubled hitman who returns home to Grosse Pointe, Michigan to attend his 10-year high school reunion and do what may be his last job.  This plot may seem like a strange place to start, but this movie ends up being one of the best films of the 90s.  What is most remarkable about Grosse Pointe Blank is how many levels is succeeds on.  It is an accomplished comedy, a truly moving drama, a great romance...  All of the humor is delicate, intelligent, and perfectly realized by Cusack and the rest of the cast, whether it be the physical humor or dry banter.  The movie truly moving, and yet it takes its dramatic subject-matter in stride; that is to say, never does the film insult the viewer (as so many movies seem to) by drawing attention to the more serious aspects.  Again, the sensational acting of Cusack and the rest of the cast help to get the movie's more serious themes across without bringing the movie down or loosing any momentum.  I did also mention that the film is romantic.  In fact, the romance is almost an afterthought, and yet this movie is one of the best romantic comedies that I know, and certainly one of the very best in recent year.  If this was not enough, Grosse Pointe Blank has great action sequences.  One of the finest gunfights on the screen and what may be the greatest REALISTIC martial arts fights in movie history.  This is simply a top-notch film with great acting, great writing, great directing, and great everything else.
