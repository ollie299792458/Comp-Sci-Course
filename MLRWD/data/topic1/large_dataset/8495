Back in the 1980's I watched and recorded on video tape, (and watched again and again), the Tales from the Darkside TV show. The original series was shot in 16mm film, which is not movie house quality, but was fine for TV, (this was of course long before HDTV). Romero and Rubenstein were striving for the 1950's EC Horror comic book feel and I think they perfectly achieved that. There has always been a claustrophobic air to the shows in this series that I like, and just like childhood comics that became ragged from reading them over and over, they bear multiple viewings,.
It was a no-brainer for me to get the Tales from the Darkside Season One DVD set upon its release. I've watched it twice. The print quality of the films are fine, much better that my old VHS copies. So, now I look on the Amazon reviews and discover that I failed to notice what some are saying was an unforgivable atrocity, that is, that the some of the original background music has been altered! If that's true, I never noticed it. It was a thoroughly enjoyable DVD experience for me. I can't wait for Season Two.
Do not believe those who demand that it is essential to pass this set up solely because the soundtrack has been unnecessarily altered. All that will happen if you do, is that you'll miss this great show.
