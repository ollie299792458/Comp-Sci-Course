this DVD show Dream Theater (DT) live at the historical japanese avenue, the Budokan, at their finest. i think DT have taken their music at another highest after having Rudess on keys, he is much more than just a keyboardist, combining speed, technique, musicality, together with Petrucci, Portnoy and Myung, they expanded their musical level to somewhere that no one had done before. and this DVD show what the best the fivesome can probably do (not the last one, Metropolis 2000, though that feature Rudess as well but the whole DVD is badly produced).

the concert footage consist of 18 songs, 5 from the lastest ablum "Train of Thought" (As I Am, This Dying Soul, Endless Sacrifice, Stream of Consciousness and In the Name of God), and some old stuff, also a new "Instrumedley", a combination of some their highly technically instrumental medley from their old songs, neck-breaking solo, breathe-taking unison, head-turning drum works, what else can i say about this... i really can't find one second from the performance that's not satisfying, their performance is no doubt at their finest.

and on disc 2, you'll be amazed that they are much more that a player/musician, they have so much knowledge on their instrument, Rudess's "turnable" keyboard setup is mind blowing, he even considered about the emergency power supply, and Petrucci's guitar setup is just as stunning, he take care of his instrument to a very subtle detail, not to mention Portnoy monster drumkit and his drum solo......

DT is no doubt one of the most influential band nowadays, not only because their superb music and musicianship, but also on their devotion on their instruments, fans and the business as well... this DVD will become one of the classic live DVD of all time, don't miss it!!
