After reviewing others' opinions on this, one of my favorite movies, I decided to throw in my two cents.  I find it a stroke of genius to create a film that can be taken on many different levels.  Yes, one can watch this film and take it literally - the plights of a misguided hedonist who turns to Christianity and experiences "The Rapture" portended by her beliefs.  But the interpretation that I come up with is a floundering woman's descent into insanity.  All of her adult life, she is searching for an answer.  She doesn't find it in casual sex.  She doesn't find it in marriage and a "happy home life".  She doesn't find it in the birth of her daughter.  And she doesn't find it in Jesus.  Ultimately (not to give away the plot), when a catastrophic life event happens, disrupting her seemingly normal life, she begins the slow descent into darkness.  
No, I don't believe the ending of this movie actually occurs anyplace other than her mind.  She is hopelessly lost and rejects any hope of salvation (mental or otherwise) whenever offered.  
All in all, a thought provoking movie that some dismiss as fluff.  This one will stay on my list of favorites....
