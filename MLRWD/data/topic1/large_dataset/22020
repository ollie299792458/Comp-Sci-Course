I am an "older" horror movie fan---not into slasher

films and teenage girls in skimpy outfits running amok.

Being a child of the 50's and 60's, it's hard to find

a really classy horror movie these days.  Well, "The

Descent" fits the bill.  My daughter and I both had

sore jaws after the film ended----from all the tension

that traveled thru that screen and into our seats!

This is a first-class fright film with a solid story

and strong female characters---all of whom have their

fears and "baggage" coming along with them on this

hellish trip.  The "feel" of the cave and the tension

between some of the women---and the fear/trapped feeling

of the film is enough.  You hardly even need the addition

of the slimy humanoid occupants of this cave.  It's a

visceral experience to see this piece of horror-dom.

Bloody-to-be-sure, but it's all in keeping with the

context of the story. If you have been waiting for a

top-notch horror film, SEE THIS MOVIE!!
