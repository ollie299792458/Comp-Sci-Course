This is a movie for all to enjoy. Kids, parents, and animation buffs of all ages will be impressed by this masterpiece. Some parents might be wondering about the PG rating -- it means just that; the parents should see  it with their kids, but they don't really have to unless they are terribly  sensitive towards certain subjects.  Some parents might object to having  their children hear about death ("It's bad to kill, but it's not bad  to die, it's part of life" explains Hogarth, the boy, to the Giant)  and such. But this is a far better movie in content and design than  anything Disney has produced in the last several years, perhaps the decade.  The animation is a lot of CG (the Giant is pure CG, believe it or not)  disguised as old fashioned cell animation, and it looks spectacular. All of  the characters were well done. 1)Hogarth, the boy, was actually pretty  cool, never annoying. 2)The Giant was amazing animationwise and as a  character, he is NOT a big dumb hulking mass. 3)The villain was creatively  done and quite deceptive.  And it is a breath of fresh air to have a (very,  very) funny kids movie WITHOUT forced, saccharin-happy, sing-song scenes or  completely lame comic relief "sidekicks". As for the violent  scenes, Tarzan, Mulan, heck even the Little Mermaid, were worse. If  anything, the superior animation might make the violence more impressive  looking in "Giant". The only thing that could be classified as  gore or maiming was a bloody nose Hogarth got when he ran into a tree. Oh,  and somebody shoots a deer (offscreen). As for objectionable language,  Hogarth says "Oh my God" and the villain and a military General  say "hell". As for the dramatic scenes, they were impeccably  done. The characters displayed emotions that were convincing (even- nay  -especially the Giant) Nothing felt artificial, nothing made me gag. The  ending made my eyes water, my girlfriend cried, and my cynical, sourpuss  brother whispered "wow!".
