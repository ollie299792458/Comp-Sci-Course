An extremely clever, ingeniously structured and, after a deceptively slow start, absolutely gripping film, "He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not" is a superb example of modern French cinema at its very best.

Describing it is impossible without giving anything away, which is a serious problem for any reviewer as a key element in its power & effectiveness is that you should see it without any knowledge at all of what happens. Suffice to say that Audrey Tautou is perfectly cast to make it so effective, that it has the "charm" & "style" that makes French films so good when they get it right, and that, by the end of it all, you'll want to hit the replay button.

Buy it or rent it, put up with the problems that subtitles cause, and then enjoy it for what it is: a superbly crafted... what? Well telling you "what" will destroy much of the enjoyment of the film and you really should avoid the temptation to find out any more than this before seeing it yourself... you won't be disappointed.
