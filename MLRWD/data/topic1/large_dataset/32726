Outstanding Concert, best of the DVD video series yet.
It has nothing but the concert, but that is all you need. It is the entire show from the tour. All members are in great form and the performance and sound are flawless. (I've seen live, or heard, over 75 different live Yesshows over the years). The next best thing, live experience or recording, that is closest to this show is the 'Yessongs' recording from 1974. The 'Word is Live' Discs 2 and 3 from the live CD box are a close 3rd. A close 4th, for performance, but not sound, is 'Starship Trooper" from 'Live in Philadelpgia 1979" (Yes, that single song performance alone comes in 4th all by itself). Rick and Steve are at their professional, emotional and technical peaks that night during that song. 5th, Symphonic Live (Magnification Tour).

But, the sound and performances here in Montreux are cleaner, and due to technology-they should be. But the band's actual playing has as much to do with it as well. Nearly every track is as good or better than it's studio predecessor or performed better than any version live on video derived over the last 15 to 20 years.

At their popular and cultural height in the 70's, Yes members were all phenominal musicians. This concert video shows age has not diminished their skills or technical musical prowess. I'm sure some will say they notice speed changes, etc. But the songs are played extremely well and with great charisma and artistry.
