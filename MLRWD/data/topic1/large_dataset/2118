Fool me once, Glee, shame on you. Fool me twice? Uhh...I don't think so.

Minus *one* star for the absurd price for a split season, especially after last year when you offered a "part one" then the "full season" without immediately offering a "part two". Are you not milking this cash cow enough, 20th Century Fox? I'll hold out for the full season at a reasonable price, thanks. (People do have DVRs, you know - if you want buyer loyalty, how about meeting us halfway?)

But I'm NOT just dinging the rating because of the marketing...minus *two more* stars for the general drop in the quality of the show. Aside from Kurt and his Dad (and two well deserved Emmy nominations for Colfer and O'Malley), the bulk of the characters have become whiny and unlikeable, especially Will and Rachel. Only Brittany and Sue (and sometimes Santana) are worth watching. The storylines seem tired. The musical choices are spotty. Gwyneth Paltrow's guest appearance was outstanding but overall this is a textbook sophomore slump to date.

Let's hope they pick it up in the second half and close strong. Maybe we should light the Bat-signal for Neil Patrick Harris?
