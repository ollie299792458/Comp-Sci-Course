The first time I ever really sat down and watched an entire "Seinfeld" episode was when they originally aired the final 2 episodes of the last season. I became interested, based off what I saw in the series finale, after all those years of ignoring the show. I've been watching re-runs and buying the DVDs ever since like clockwork (every November and May for the past 3 years). I sat here thinking to myself, "Isn't it almost November? I wonder if the new 'Seinfeld' DVD is being advertised yet?" So I checked Amazon.com and there it was, coming out next week! This show, like "Married with Children" was so innovative that it spawned many copy-cat shows that ended up looking inferior and unwatchable (Friends) to their predecessors. The ending starts at the beginning, basically stating that as shallow and misguided the characters were, the one thing they were looking for in other people was amongst themselves the whole time. They were meant to be together, and ended up that way, in jail. Hope I didn't ruin the ending. Jerry even mentioned it to Elaine in the episode where he released all his emotions: "Maybe everything we've been looking for has been between us the whole time". And Elaine reitterated that statement. Kramer may have said the exact same thing in an earlier episode, in "The Fix Up". The one thing I'm going to need closure on is to see the origin of that clip where Elaine has a dream that the 4 of them are all in the same bed. I've watched every episode and every deleted scene and I can't find it, except in that one clip show where it originated. What show is that from? If they don't reveal that in this last DVD set, I'll go ballistic!
