I love Hitchcock and I love his films. I recently bought the Paramount Centennial Collection version of TO CATCH A THIEF.
The quality of the picture is pristine. Beautiful.
The film comes with Audio and Subtitles in English/French/Spanish and it has an enormous load of bonus features. These also have subtitles in the three languages.

Bonus Features:

Disc 1:
Commentary by Dr. Drew Casper, Hitchcock Film Historian

Disc 2;
"A Night with the Hitchcocks"
"Unacceptable Under the Code: Film Censorship in America"
"Writing and Casting To Catch a Thief"
"The Making of To Catch a Thief"
"Behind the Gates: Cary Grant and Grace Kelly"
"Alfred Hitchcock and To Catch a Thief: An Appreciation"
"Edith Head: The Paramount Years"
"If You Love To Catch a Thief, You'll Love This" - An "interactive travelogue"
Original Theatrical Trailer
Galleries
Eight pages booklet

I highly recommend this version.
