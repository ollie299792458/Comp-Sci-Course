Dante's Peak seems like the ideal place to live... the serenity of the mountainous landscape and the friendly atmosphere seems to wipe out the fact that the town is nestled at the base of a dormant volcano. However,  when the U.S.G.S. begins to pick up signals from the volcano that indicate  a possible eruption, they send Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan) to  investigate. While there, he befriends town mayor Rachel Wando (Linda  Hamilton) and informs her of the risks. When he begins to get the city  council into an uproar, his advisor shows up to cool things down and wards  off any ideas of an eruption. But the symptoms begin to grow, and soon, ash  and rock are flying in the sky as the mountain explodes upon the small  township. It's a race for survival for Dalton and Wando, as they must  search for Wando's children and get them out before the impending final  showdown with the volcano. Digital Domain's special effects contribute so  much to the story, making it real and placing its characters in real peril.  Suspense, action, romance and a terrific cast make this disaster movie a  winner. The DTS version is remarkable, and it is recommended that this be  the version you buy.
