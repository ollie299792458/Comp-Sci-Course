I just watched this movie and loved it!  If you're looking for bullets, blood or nudity then look elsewhere. If the subject of homosexuality bothers you then you might also be offended by this film.

If however, you are captivated by witty dialogue(there is some swearing along with it), an intelligent script, and can decipher English accents (there are subtitles available), then this might be a movie for you. There is plenty of action but it takes the form of verbal jousting.

The story centers around a tight knit group of older teenaged male students and the teachers who are trying to inspire them in order that they might be successful at gaining admittance to prestigious Oxford or Cambridge University.  It is very much a story about relationships, and not surprisingly, the "natural" evolution of history.

The actors were expertly cast and use humour thoughout the film very effectively to make their points and simply entertain.  The topic of homsexuality is touched upon more than once in the film but it is done in such a way as NOT to make the audience feel threatened or uncomfortable.

I highly recommend this film.
