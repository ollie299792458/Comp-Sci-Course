For anyone who appreciates the majesty of the oceans,this is the video for you! Dana Brown is the son of Bruce Brown of the two "Endless Summer" movies. He obviously acquired his father's love and "eye" for being able to express his love of the oceans...and the people who surf them...for this video will actually "Move" you. The cinematography is unparalleled and the music is chosen to perfection. There are stories of current, previous and up-and-coming surfers...including females..and the oceans they surf. The stories range from the comical to the touching all interconnect and many are narrated by some of the best known surfers(Gerry Lopez,Laird Hamilton,Kelly Slater,Elaine Beachley,Robert August,who was in the "Endless Summer",and his son,Sam.Just to mention a few.He takes you around the world to some of the most breathtaking locations.They show surfing in the Great lakes and surfing behind tankers in the Gulf of Mexico.At the end, a group surfs 60'+ waves 100 miles off the California coast.
  It is obvious that this is a labor of love by someone who deeply appreciates the beauty and the power of our oceans. I don't have the Blu-ray edition...yet...and I still experience Dana's respect and admiration for it's beauty and am humbled by it's power.Experiencing this majesty through his eyes is,not to sound "trite",...TOTALLY AWESOME !
 Highest recommendation!
