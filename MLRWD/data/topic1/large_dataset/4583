i don't care what anyone says. this movie pushed the limit with the horror/comedy subgenre. and the very fact that was even released in theatres amazes me. it was only released because it was made during the eighties, a period that mostly ignored "political-correctedness" in the media. the way race, women, and the poor are shown is completly differnent from what a movie would be like in 2006. and i think movies back then showed more truth in life, to the way things really are. i don't think something like this would even be considered for a movie today. the storyline is outragous, it follows no plot. and people would probably be hesistant to even act in it, might they offend somebody and recieve a lawsuit. their are many sterotypes displayed in this cinematic gold, but who cares? i hate that now writers and actors will stunt their creativity to fit some kind of greater political agenda, which we face now under the current administration. movies like this make me want to cry for the way things used to be.

i kid you not. and don't drink the vipor.
