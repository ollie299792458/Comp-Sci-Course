I first saw High Noon on a double bill with McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller in the mid seventies, when I'd first moved to Chicago after college. I was impressed at the time, thought it a brilliant film, and wondered why the  hand-out sheet from the revival house (long gone) was so contemptuous of  it. Almost 25 years later, I've managed to read up on all the negative High  Noon material: That it's not a "real" western, that its an  anti-western(? ), that real westerners didn't act that way, that it wasn't  made by Howard Hawks or John Ford, so it must be lousy, blah-blah-blah.  Nonsense, all of it, carping from those with some strange agenda. Judge it  for what it is, and what it is is a brilliant film. A film so bleak in its  view of the human condition that by the final frame, each and every  character has had every belief and tenet he or she lived by, completely  shattered. Forever. High Noon has continued to grow over the decades.  Reading John from NYC's review on this page, about how the feminists have  embraced it, makes me eager to watch it again, from this perspective. It is  my favorite film.
