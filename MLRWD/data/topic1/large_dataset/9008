As I had stated in the title, this is a solid 3 1/2 to 4 star piece of entertainment. This is the type of film you can just place in your DVD player and watch on and off as you find time. While each segment is far from created equal, some do actually border on the brilliantly comic. My I highlight the obvious? Tom Waits and Iggy Pop have fantastic chemistry together during their sketch, this is probably due to the rapport the to artists most likely share for one another in real life. Cate Blanchett's sketch is something of a tour de force seeings how she's playing opposite only herself. Now while this has been done numerous times by other actors (Nicholas Cage, Sam Rockwell, Ewan McGregor etc.) it's never and easy task, especially since she manages to bring weight and pathos to both characters, one being herself and the other being her fairly "trashy" cousin. Other highlights include Steve Coogan with Alfred Molina and Renee French with E.J. Rodriguez, with others being a mixed bag though never less than mildly enjoyable. In fact, the whole thing sort of plays like an elitist, hipster version of a sketch comedy show, with each sketch centering around the use of coffee and cigarettes, cause when it all comes down to it it's all about the vibe this collection creates. The mood for good friends, coffee, and cigarettes.
