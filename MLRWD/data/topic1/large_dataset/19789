This is not a bad movie.  It's just not as good as it should be.  Take a highly successful Broadway musical.  Transfer it to the screen with writing by the original authors.  Add a couple of pleasant songs.  Throw in stars who would appear to be well matched along with veteran character actors and you get...less than you expect.
The problem is the chemistry between Holiday and Martin just doesn't click.  It has been said that Holliday didn't think Martin was right for the part in spite of her personal affection for him.  She may have been right.  For all his charm, it is hard to believe Dean as a playwright suffering writers block. That said, Dean was so good at musical comedy that it still doesn't add up.
Perhaps it was the timing.  This movie came at the tail end of the popularity of Hollywood musicals and also near the end of the career of both Holliday and Director Vincent Minnelli.
Whatever the reasons it is a movie that has some good moments and fine songs but is less than it should of been.
