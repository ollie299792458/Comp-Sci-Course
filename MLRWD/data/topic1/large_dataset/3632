This movie is a great drama all about how you can't escape from things you have done in the past. The cast is near perfect Barbara Stanwyck is lovable and then scary all at the same time. (love her) Van Heflin is letter perfect throughout only Lizbeth Scott's over the top performance looks creaky at this time. (altho you do feel sorry for her which is the point I guess) and Kirk Douglas gives a strong performance. (if a little miscast - he is too manly and strong to be the cuckold husband)

Howeve this COPY of the film is atrocious. It is a bad print that at times had fluctuations in the lighting, weird blips and other things happen on the screen. Its just a bad copy that needs to be cleaned up. Then there is the fact that they have packaged it all about KIRK DOUGLAS which is really dumb. This is really Van Heflin and Stanwyck's film. Douglas isn't onscreen as often as Van Heflin. (and he doesn't have the best part) So true Kirk Douglas fans may be turned off.

The Kirk Douglas documentary is just a voice over with some move trailers. Really lame compared to documentaries on other DVDS.

Love the movie but this DVD is a rip off. Im giving mine to charity
