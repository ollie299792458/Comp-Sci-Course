I saw Tombstone and loved it.  I looked up Wyatt Earp on the Internet and found a beautifully done Web Site dedicated to him.  I was surprised that he died in 1929, in Colma, Calif.  Since I live in Calif. and it wasn't that long ago, I wanted to learn more.  While ordering the movie, Wyatt Earp (which was also great) I ordered this documentary.  It was very good with lots of good historical pictures.  I wish that there had been a larger variety of pictures available.  I noticed the same pictures being reused several times.  I liked the use of the maps of the OK Corral, Tombstone and of the cattle trails from Texas to Kansas.  I would have liked to seen more on how Wyatt winds up in Colma, Calif. and where that might be located.  This documentary just causes me to search for more answers.  
Also, I was very curious about the Directors, Producers and the musical scores all being done by the Dalton family?  If there was any historical connection or relationship between them and the Earps or the Dalton "gang"?
I would like to complain about the decision to produce the 82 min video in the EP Mode or long play mode.  Then they made it into a 2 video Tape Set.  So in the middle of the documentary you have to get up and change the video.  Why do the Distributor's do that?  I will probably have the video professionally cut onto one tape, but then I will still have to keep the extra tape, because the cover that it came in is for 2 tapes and is too nice to get rid of.  I just hate to have to store extra videos if I didn't have to.
It is still worth seeing.
