I think it was at least 10 minutes in to this movie before it started to feel at all like a comedy.  Other reviewers described it well; it jerks between intense drama and low-brow comedy.  For example, I think there there was an abrubt transition from a scene where Carlos threatens & slaps Lisa to a scene featuring fart jokes; it had the emotional effect of trivializing the abuse or making the humor seem cold-hearted or both, not what I would think Perry wanted to achieve.  Things like this just gave the whole movie a somewhat "B-movie" feel.

Still & all, there was a surprisingly strong connection for me, largely because it wrestles with a lot of psychological archetypes and issues that are common in black culture, and probably in low income communities in general.  The psychological scars of abuse & drugs; the dilemna of staying or leaving an abusive relationship when you have no income; ambivalence about success & money; absentee parents; school bullies; disrepectful & delinquent teens; fear of intimacy; tough old survivors with jaundiced attitudes or spiritual strength or both.  Perry plays out these very serious themes, but includes enough comedy so that, at the end, you come away not weighed down, but with optimism and faith that, in spite of all the difficulties, the human spirit will find a way to bloom.

Overall, a movie with definite, obvious flaws that still works because of 1) great performances, and 2) compelling themes that strongly resonate with its target audience of black Americans.
