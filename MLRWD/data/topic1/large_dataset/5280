I must confess I had forgotten just how good this movie actually is.  The plot involves the adventures of one gold digger (Monroe) and one man hungry vamp (Russell).  While I must confess that for Monroe this probably was her starmaking role, Russell really shines in the role of Dorothy, who inevitably must play Ethel to Marilyn Monroe's Lucy.

The tone is set for this movie by the opening number which involves Russell and Monroe singing about "The Man from Little Rock."  I am not sure how much effort was put into shooting this particular number, but Russell and Monroe are so striking that even the dead probably would take notice and burst into applause.

This movie is famous for the "Diamonds are a girl's best Friend" number that Monroe did and Madonna copied in her "Material Girl" video.  However, for my money, Russell certainly shows her considerable star quality when she parodies this number in the subsequent court room scene. No wonder Russell impressed Howard Hughes in her heyday. Hopefully she will be the subject of one of the box set tribute collections.

In short, this movie is a pure delight and well worth repeated watchings.  It is worth the price of admission to see two great stars at the height of their powers.
