I loved the action, special effects, plot twists, and in the end the beautiful anna sophia robb being the angel of God on Earth come to slay the wicked was simply awesome! I absolutely loved the plot and the acting and sound were superb. Hillary Swank was excellent as well. They could not have cast these two better.

I think Idris Elba was mis-cast -- probably to politically-correctly couterbalance the first part of the film where Hillary Swank's family was killed by machete for voodoo reasons in Africa by blacks... Can't have blacks being the voodoo bad guys and that's it. Come to think of it, the whole film was aimed at the plantation / deep traditional south types as being just as voodoo as the Africans -- a sort of spiritual affirmative-action? There is only one problem. We know the average IQ of Africans is around 67, but for American whites the average is over 100... so that part was hard to swallow. Africans are way more voodoo than southern whites ever dreamed of being. So what's up with that? Lets stop beating up on southerners and promoting negative stereotypes that are untrue. Pretty nitpicky, I know... At least it was not as blatantly political as "Villiage of the Damned" or "Schindlers List" or something.

Other than that, I truly do not understand the negative reviews. This was a great movie -- suspenseful, gripping, powerful. Great acting. Great sound. Great special effects. If you liked Anna Sophia Robb in "Because of Winn-Dixie" and "Bridge to Terabithia" then you will love her in this too as an angel of God. She is great.
