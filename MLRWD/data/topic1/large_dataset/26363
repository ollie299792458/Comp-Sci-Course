I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH! It's now my favorite next to The Lion King (one and two) actually. But just because I'm 14 doesn't mean I liked it for the animals. Don't get me wrong, the animals were great and adorable but I really loved the lessons this movie taught. When my dad first reccomended it to me, I thought it was just another stupid perverted movie that some man got God's powers and made girls dresses go up (no offense to any Bruce Almighty likers. But this movie taught the lessons of faith, never giving up, kindness towards all, God loves everybody, going for the curves rather than being businesslike and straight, and the importance of fun and family. I espeically loved that "God" said that ARK stands for "Acts of Random Kindess". It really touched my heart when "God" was showing Evan that you can do good deeds that don't have to be major to change the world by when he filled up the dogs water dish and then the dog drank it. It was also giving a powerful message we can all learn from when "God" showed Evan, Evan's old home which was once a beautiful forest and was then torn down by the lust for money and power which was man's doing. This movie was EXTREMLEY AWSOME.
