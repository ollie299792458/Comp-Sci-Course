All that they have for evidence is paintings&a book&a few pictures(and suface reports by witnesses).That does not show
how he was or why he painted what he did or why he wrote what he did.He may have been haunted by a childlike world of aloness&fantasy whoose real meaning are in feeling those feelings which we can,t do.The idea of using a b acting stereotypical sothern normal voice to be his voice is assuming everything,stupid and not even interesting or creative.The animation world created by animating the paintings may be presenting a pyschological flavor not of darger at all.So in the end there is no movie just the illusion of one.
Harris flug-ps the director in her interview is very pure in thought&emotion&so is in contrast to the film.By his buying of religon,the mythical importance of war(its actually of course an obscene nothingness or infinite abyss)and mythical importance of the image(by painting thousands of times)it shows hes really not an independant thinker at all just unable to do the following to the conformist grave&so still dies mentally but in an abnormal way(nothing to be proud of or to admire)
