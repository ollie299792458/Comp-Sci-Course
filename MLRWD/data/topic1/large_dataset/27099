This video is packed dense with material.  No wonder it failed to make it to the TV sets across the US.  It was produced masterfully but the subject was too heavy and someone killed it.
If you want content and if you are not yet familiar with the number one [plan] of all times, and if you don't know where to start, then this video will lay it all out for you.  Beginning with the hatching of the Federal Reserve, our fiat currency, our puppet party systems, all funded by the very same globalists behind the CFR, Bilderberg.com, UN and the tax exempt foundations.... then this video is for you.
On the other hand, if you have been trying to wake that special person up to reality but all of your hammering has worked against you, then pop in this video....
The only reason I gave this video 4 stars and not 5 is because some of the filming techniques, for example a shot of a spinning nickel with a raspy blues song in the background singing "Just when you thought you were ahead of the game, someone changes the rules."  Well once or twice would be OK, but I must have seen that spinning nickel 5-6 times....
