This was the Begining of the decline for Batman. What can I say, the Batman films changed a lot, from dark gothic and moody, to well campy. The I'm not gonna blame the actors for this film, I think most of them did the best they could with the material the were given. I actually kind of thought that Jim Carrey as the riddler was kind of fun, but that's the only positive thing about this film.

 If you ever saw an episode of the early 90's Batman the animated series, you'll realize how much more serious and interesting those episodes were than this movie. Damn I miss that show. But I do not miss Mr Schumacher directing Batman, in fact I am glad he is no longer directing them.  Once again the actors did the best they could with what they had, let's take a look at Tommy lee JOnes, he is a really godd academy award winning actor, but the two face character was really downplayed in this movie. The riddler was funny but not funny enough to save this. Oh and the bat suits, well what can I say about them that hasn't already been said before. Im not gonna say much more other than I though this film was awful.
