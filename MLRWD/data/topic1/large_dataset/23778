i won't bore you with what so many others have stated more eloquently here. suffice it to say that this dvd belongs in every film buff's collection. the dvd itself is nothing special, no extras, etc. but the film itself has apparently been nicely restored including all the footage deleted from the original theatrical release.
like all howard hawks films, it includes a great script with overlapping dialog, and a strong female character. the nyby vs hawks debate may rage on but i know who directed this film. hawks was an amazing director. he could direct ANY kind of film from screwball comedy, to westerns, to, here, sci-fi, and do it better than just about anyone else. he is definitely in my top 5 directors of all time.
i have promised myself that someday i'll make a dvd of all my favorite scenes from my favorite films. the ken tobey door opening scene will be close to the top of the list. yeah, you're expecting the guys will meet up with the thing, just not that soon...
i guess the budget on this film was low. that sure didn't hurt it at all. the highest compliment i can pay it is to call it the "casablanca" of sci-fi. it's in my top 100 best of all time.
