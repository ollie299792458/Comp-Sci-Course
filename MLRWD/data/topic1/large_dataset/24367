Simply put, Alias' final season rocked.

It had everything that us fans have come to love; Action, drama, mystery, doulbe-crosses, shocking reveals, and everything else that makes Alias great.

Jennifer Garner is untouchable in the lead. Sydney discovers early on that she is pregnant, and when Vaughn is murdered, she sets out on a mission to protect not only her unborn child, but also herself. Not only that, but she must now uncover the truth surrounding Vaughn's past, and those responsable for his demise.

Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin are also brilliant as Sydney's father and sworn enemy. Sloane, once again, grabs our sympathy early on, and we want nothing more than for him to cure his daughter. Lena Olin reappears as Irina Derevko, and is more fabulous than ever. New cast additions include Elodie Bouchez as a mysterious fugitive from Vaughn's past, Balthzar Getty as new recruit Tom Grace, who is also harbouring a dark secret. Finally, Rachel Nichols joins the cast as a rookie agent who must be trained by Sydney, after working for the men behind Vaughn's murder.
