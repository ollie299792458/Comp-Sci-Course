If you are an action movie fan, then this is a movie you must see.  The story is very simple and to the point, wasting very little screen time covering what you need to know.  There is a SWAT team that has volunteered to raid a slum that is housing one of the city's most ruthless crime lords, along with all of the thugs he allows to reside in the building.  That's really all you need to know, and the movie moves along from there.

The fighting is brutal and well-shot, opting out of the standard shaky-cam style used in more modern action movies, instead giving you a clear picture of exactly what is happening on the screen at all times.  As things escalate further in to the movie, things get move visceral and intense.  When I left the theater I was actually sore from how tense my body was during the majority of it's runtime.

I've never written a review here before, but this movie has absolutely encouraged me to do so.  If you're looking for a complex story with a lot of twists and turns, then I'd suggest looking elsewhere.  If you're looking for a movie with a solid, straight forward story that has more action and hand-to-hand combat than you would believe, then this is definitely a movie you need to watch.

Highly recommended.
