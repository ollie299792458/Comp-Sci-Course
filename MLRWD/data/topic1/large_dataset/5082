I have been a fan of Kenshin for some time now.  Although I have not read any of the Manga since I do not read much.  I really enjoyed this box set.  The first two DVD's Trust and Betrayal are my favorites of the three and the story could have just stopped right there and I would have been just as satisfied.  My roommate never having watched any Kenshin before found Reflections, the third DVD, hard to follow and he said he was a little disappointed in it.  Reflections is mostly all flashbacks and the story jumps around a lot from past to present.  It was a bit hard for me to follow at times but at the end it all came together.  As for the animation I have to say I thought it looked very good.  The color was brilliant, maybe I had my TVs contrast turned way up.  It is pretty bloody and violent at times, but it is also a love story of sorts.  Over all if you like Kenshin you will like this wonderful box set.  If you are new to Anime but intested in Samaria X/Kenshin then you might try and buy just Samaria X Trust, the first in this set, and give it a try.  I give it 5 stars, my roommate says 4.
