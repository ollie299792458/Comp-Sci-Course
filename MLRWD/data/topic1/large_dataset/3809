I have an interest in these sorts of independent documentaries, but I always approach with caution. A lot of liberals and others with questionable motives use documentaries to express themselves, which of course is fine. I am not interested in having the producer of a documentary trying to manipulate the way I think, which is why I like factual documentaries. With this film, I suspected I might not like it, even 30 minutes into it I was not sure if I would finish it, but I did. I am glad I did, it was very informative and I really enjoyed it. It is a shame to see what is happening to our food.

In a real sense, the film is conservative (but not necessarily in a political way, perhaps "philosophically traditional" is better) in essence. It drives home the point that government is the problem. Due to government subsidies and such, the markets are not balanced in a natural way. The government should really stop this nonsense before the damage is irreparable or extremely painful. If most of our food is made from corn, were the price of corn to shoot up (i.e. if subsidies stopped) then so would the price of food. Presenting us with be a very bad situation. This of course goes without mentioning the danger to health from having a largely corn based diet.

I recommend this film.
