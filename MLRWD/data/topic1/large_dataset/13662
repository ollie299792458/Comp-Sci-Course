Like so many other reviewers here, I am a huge fan of this story and have watched most of the movie and television versions. I was waiting for this one to show up at my local movie theaters but it never did, and now I know why - who would want to see it?

 I found the settings to be very well done - the darkness that comes with gas lighting and small windows left rooms and people only half lit and that has been missed in many other versions. I also found the flash back technique interesting and a good way to tell the story.

However, I thought the dialogue was so stilted and almost non-existent that I couldn't find enough to make me believe that an aristocrat would even notice or become entranced by a plain looking governess. The lack of dialogue also creeped me out because Rochester is in his mid 30's and Jane is 19 - without enough talk to convince me that he had found something of real substance in Jane, I had concerns of borderline pedophelia by Rochester - I mean really, why else would a middle aged man be interested in a homely teenager who only says one or two short sentences at each encounter?

I look forward to the next version because this one just didn't work for me. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053Q9DHW">Jane Eyre</a>
