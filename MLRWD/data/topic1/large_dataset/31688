Excellent in every way.  Sound is flawless, video is brilliant.  Brooker really has great stage presence and connects with the audience.  I was surprised by Geoff Whitehorn - not your typical PH player but he clicks with the group with inspired ease, in ways Robin Trower came close to but never managed.  The whole group looks relaxed and having fun, like they're just jamming in their livingroom.

Standouts - Weisselklenzenact - best performance ever.  Homburg - they make this look easy.  Whiter Shade - the 3 verse version closes the concert.

Repent Walpurgis is not included :-(  It would have been perfect in this setting.  Brooker said something about the key it's in being killed off years ago.

Extras - not really necessary.  Brooker answers a few interview questions.  There's an alternate view track on a couple of the songs - it looks like taken from an audience member with a B&W 8mm.  Nice if you want to feel like you're in the audience, but with the excellent on-stage camera work you really have a much better view than the audience got.

Woof!
