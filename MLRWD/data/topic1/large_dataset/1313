This movie has been discussed to death and there is little to add.  I'd like to comment on those suffering from a sickness called 'hate Americans, love Indians'.  Custer was a professional soldier and a patriot.  Those who think that he hated Indians should read his book 'My LIfe on the Plains'. It is very suprising that he didn't hate Indians.  Mrs. Custer used to hear stories of white women who survived Indian attacks and tell him about it. These attacks didn't consist of group therapy.  The plains Indians were extremely sadistic.  They attacked isolated settlements, killed and mutilated the men, gang rape the women after torturing them, then enslave them and sold some as whores to other tribes. I would like to see some of the Indian lovers, who probably never had to fight for their lives, maintain their sanity after hearing horror stories like these as Custer did.  Custer was a true American hero, and although played by an Australian (Flynn), this movie will remain one of the best patriotic movies coming out of Hollywood.
