Braveheart is by far the most riveting, completely enthralling movie I have ever seen...The story is set in 14th century Scottland and details the Scotts struggle against British agression...
Based on a true story,  William Wallace, played superbly by Mel Gibson, unites the Scotts and  refuses to allow the powerful King Edward the Longshanks of England to take  control of the country...
The story may not be completely based on facts  as this happened so long ago and the legend of William Wallace has probably  grown bigger than the man, but the story-line here is  incredible...
Basically it's a love story, not between a man and a woman,  but between a man and his country...I don't think I'll ever see a movie  that moves me the way this one does at the end...
When it looks like  Longshanks has him with no where to go, Longshanks thinks he'll bow down to  him since it's either that or death...William Wallace then says, "You  can take my life, but you'll never take my freedom"
Watch it if you  haven't...You won't be disappointed...
