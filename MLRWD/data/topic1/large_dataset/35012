It might be hard to believe today but there was a time when rock and roll was considered scandalous, filthy!
When the "establishment" had the silly notion that the jungle beat would not only brain wash us but turn us into savage juveniles.
This is a movie that portrays that time to perfection.
The dj's are heroes and the music not only changed our lives, it saved our lives.

It was our music. Not the establishments, not our parents. Ours.
The movie itself is about those pioneering dj's that were brave enough to "fight city hall".
The performances are wonderful with each important scene puntuated by a great rock and roll track from the era.
I like the fact that they were true to 60's FM radio and featured a lot of lesser know tunes.

The montage (and music) over the closing credits will have you cheering.
No Beatles tunes but I'm sure that is due to the fact that rights could not be obtained.

Just a great story, solid performances and fantastic soundtrack. A must see.

One last thing, were our parents really afraid that we would be brainwashed by rock and roll music?
I hate to say it but looking back over the last 40-50 years, they were right!
