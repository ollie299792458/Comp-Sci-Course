In this Cinderella re-make, Hilary Duff plays highschool misfit Sam. It's the standard Cinderella story with a modern twist: the lovers use e-mail and text messaging, the Prince works at a drive thru car wash, the enchanted kingdom is Princeton, and Cinderella is not only beautiful and good-hearted, but smart and self-confident (eventually)

Being in college myself and having seen my share of Cinderella movies, and read my share of the same in novels, I still found this movie a refreshing take on the old scheme, and better than most. Sam is not just seeking romance in her life, she's got dreams and real problems, like paying for college. There is unexpected depth in her relationship with Austin which far surpasses most teen movies. I love it when he quotes poetry to her, and the speech she gives him at the end is great. I even rewound it to hear again.

The movie itself is weak at points, the stepsisters try for funny and are more just painful (Coolidge does a better job as the stepmother), the portrayal of the college-application process is a bit unrealistic, the fact that slender, pretty and spunky Duff would be such an outcast is farfetched, most of the supporting student cast are stereotypes, etc, but its still a good film.

Definitely a feel good movie, and one that no mother should worry about her daughter enjoying.
