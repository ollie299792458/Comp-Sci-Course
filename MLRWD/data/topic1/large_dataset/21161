The movie itself flowed well and was visually appealing.  I had a few real issues with the movie.  First of all the main chacater is a Jumper who is able to go from place to place in the blink of the eye.  He seemed to have had this ability from childhood, but never realized it.  He is 15 before he knows he can move thru space.  My question is how did he get this power.  Turns out there are other Jumpers, no one questions this?  Than there are hunters of the Jumpers....who the heck are these guys and wehre did they come from.

It seemed for a brief second that there was a chance to make our Jumper a Super Hero, there is a scene with people drowing in a river the newscaster says they will need a miracle to survive.  The Jumper is watching on tv, does he go save them?  Turns out that the kid is a selfish young man who uses his powers to seduce the ladies and steal things.  Never once does he ask himself why he was given the power.

The other issue was the relationship with his childhood sweetheart.  She thinks he is dead than he walks back into her life and he sweeps her off her feet, no questions asked.  She plays a way to gulable character and comes off as unbelivable.

Take away all the negatives and the movie flowed well and was an easy movie to watch.  I will never see it again, but if there were a Jumpers 2, I would probably watch it.
