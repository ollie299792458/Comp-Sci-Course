Doctor Zhivago is a film I really had to question even though it has stood the test of time and is undeniably a classic. 
The cinematography is breathtaking and is accompanied by brilliant musical scores. I see it as one of the most stylish films of the 20th century. My problem with this film is the story. Not really the whole story but rather the main character Doctor Zhivago. I found myself detesting him for his lack of self-control and unfaithfulness to his more than faithful wife. It made me ask myself if this is actually a love story set during a countries revolution or the story of a hypocrite set during a counties revolution? I say hypocrite because Zhivago detests the lack of morals in a revolting society surrounding him yet he is a man obviously lacking in morals himself. Are the things that happen to him sort of a just punishment for his hypocrisy? To be honest with you, no I see it more as punishment for the people he has betrayed and the people he indulges his urges with. His absence affects others more than himself. They depend on him. 
That's just the way I see it. Now with all that said does that said do I hate this movie because of that? No, I think I should be praising it instead. Just because I don't like a characters choices in a film doesn't mean I should hate the film. This film would have never been as effective if Zhivago didn't cheat on his wife. Any character that stirs up a viewer's emotions whether it's love or hate is a job well done. If a viewer has strong emotions for a character it is the mark of a great film. Mixed viewer emotions for a character is brilliance. It is the sign of true portrayal of a human being.  There are things to love and hate about all of us.  I loved Doctor Zhivago and I hated Doctor Zhivago. That's why it is such a brilliant film.
