I love the film 'Backdraft'.Many firefighters watching have criticised it but it's not real life is it? The film stars a very good-looking William Baldwin and a muscley looking Kurt Russell.They star as the McCaffrey brothers,whose father was killed in a fire years before.The two feuding siblings are forced to work with each other in the same firefighting unit which neither is happy about.Stephen (Russell) feels he has to protect his younger brother and Brian (Baldwin)feels he has to do well in front of his 'kick-[bootie]' firefighter big brother.It is good to see Russell attempt some emotional roles and he plays his brotherly role well,the scenes where Brian rescues a mannequin and Stephen chases him up to the fire-station roof always have me laughing as well as the 'War' song.And the wonderful lines 'Look at him,that's my brother ...' and 'who's your brother Brian' have me blubbing like a baby 10 minutes before they even come on.The great scenes with Stephen fixxing Brian's fire-suit always get to me too.Brothers hey,you gotta love them and this film is such a great example of fire,bravery and brotherly love.
