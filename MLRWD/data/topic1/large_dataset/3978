Very good movie, and one of the best old ones I've seen. Oddly enough the only reason I watched it was to pick up parallels with 'Did You See the Surise?' But anyway, William Holden was great and was a rather unlikely type of hero. The large cast and overall plotting was quite interesting, too. While it went rather slow for the first half, it really kicked in during the second. Great stuff there regarding the infiltrator inside Barrack 4 and so forth. The scene with this traitor is revealed is one of my all-time favorite scenes in any movie. The ending is also quite good, and ironic too. I love irony, I might add.
The large cast works very well, too.  You get the Animal and Shapiro duo, which provides comic relief.  (Although I personally thought Animal was a bit boorish and annoying, little Harry Shapiro was pretty funny.)  Barracks Chief Hoffy and Security Chief Price are the two people in carge, although you also get the very emotional Duke, Blondie the tech expert, poor permanently shell-shocked Joey, and Cookie the narrator.  Holden stars as Sefton, the cynical, pragmatic, and rejected Barracks 4 member. And one of these people is feeding information to the Germans.  Information that gets two prisoners, Manfreedy and Johnson, killed in a failed escape attempt in the first scene.  But I'm not saying any more than that, of course.
In any case, after watching this movie I had the 'jonny comes marching home again' them stuck in my head. Great use of that, too, especially in the afformentioned revelation scene. Highly reccomended.
