I recently finished watching the movie Under the Tuscan Sun a few hours ago and I'm proud to say that it was quite good. It's not one of my favourites but I liked how... unconventional it was. It wasn't your "classic" cliched romantic comedy. I really loved that about it. Diane Lane's performance, in my opinion, was one of the best I've seen in a film this year. It's rare for me to enjoy a movie, especially one that is, in places, narrated but it was truly a great movie to watch. It takes place in Italy and as I recall most of the production crew was Italian, which I thought was a very good idea for who knows Italy better than the people who live there? The cast was an interesting array of talented men and women. I especially liked Sandra Oh as Patti and Lindsay Duncan as Katherine. The script was my favourite part of the entire film although the setting was beautiful and the cast well chosen. I think the only thing that I didn't like about it was that I couldn't connect with it personally, which says absolutely nothing about the movie. When it comes right down to it, I would have to say that I would recommend this movie to just about anyone.
