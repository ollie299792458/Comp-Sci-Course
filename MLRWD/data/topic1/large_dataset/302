Almost certainly you'll find the plot a little hard to follow, but that's not what's important here.  Snatch is a terrific movie broken down into bite size chucks.  Think of Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail (except remove the slapstick and insert London gangsters) and you'll have the right idea.  Even though everything hangs together, each scene is enjoyable by itself.  You could start this movie at almost any point and just start laughing your head off.
What amused me most about "Snatch" was Guy Ritchie's use of incredibly brief flashbacks and cut scenes as a means of characterization.  Franky "Four Fingers", a gangster who also happens to be a compulsive gambler, is a perfect example.  Every time somebody mentions gambling around Franky, we a treated to a quick scene of Franky's eyes glazing over, followed by pictures of him ridiculously drunk in a Las Vegas casino all set to the tune of "Viva Las Vegas".  Very funny!  As always Brad Pitt is hilarious.  You should defiantly check this movie out.
