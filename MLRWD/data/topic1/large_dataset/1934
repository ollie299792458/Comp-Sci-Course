I saw "Eclipse" on Saturday afternoon.  It's simply brilliant!  I absolutely LOVED it!  "Eclipse" had everything.  Action, humour and, of course, wonderful romance!  The scriptwriter did a brilliant job of translating the book to the screen.

Bryce Dallas Howard did a great job as Victoria.  Who would have thought that nice Richie Cunningham (i.e. Ron Howard) from "Happy Days" would sire such a stunningly beautiful daughter!  And yes, I do know that I'm showing my age............

I loved the `Magic Triangle' scenes between Bella, Edward and Jacob.  The chemistry between Kristen, Robert and Taylor is fantastic!  Up until "Eclipse", I have always thought that Taylor Lautner was the best actor out of the three of them.  However after watching this movie, I've changed my mind.  Don't get me wrong.  Taylor is a fine young actor.  He's smart, talented and will clearly go a long way in this industry.

However, I have to disagree with Robert Pattinson when he said that the yellow contact lenses interfered with his acting and didn't allow him to show the kind of emotion through his eyes that he wanted to portray.  I think that he showed plenty of emotion through his eyes.  I honestly think that Robert is going to be a very good actor and one to watch in the future.

I hope that everyone enjoys watching "Eclipse" as much as I did.  I CAN"T WAIT until the DVD comes out so that I can watch it over and over again!
