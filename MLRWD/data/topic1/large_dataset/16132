I have had a fasination about what it was like being a prisoner on the rock.Recently I went to visit Alcatraz to take a look for myself and I was so stunned that I was actually on the rock, where they kept the worst of the worst. After my trip I immediatly rented Escape of Alcatraz(because out of all of the movies made of Alcatraz this one is the most acurate!).The movie was based on a true story about the 1962 breakout.  After watching it I found interesting little things that hollywood changed just to make it unique. In the movie there were three people in on it ,but in reality there were four and Clint Eastwood's charactor wasn't the one that planned it. Sure his charactor made it out ,but since this was hollywood and Clint Eastwood was star of the movie his charactor needed to plan it and escape. The one who planned it didn't make it out with the others. He did try five hours after the other three made it out.
It's still a hollywood gem. I loved the movie a lot. Clint Eastwood is great in this one (as he does with all of his other films) I enjoyed it even more that they acually filmed the movie on Alcatraz(so if you've been there you would notice many of the places they filmed at). The story is very straight forward and rock hard performances. As well as an ending that leads you to differant conclusions.
