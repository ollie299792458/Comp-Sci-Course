The MPAA says "VIOLENCE IS OKAY - but we'll be damned if we show the natural nature of sex."

This is a great film that deserves more appreciation. After all, Ang Lee is the same director as Brokeback Mountain and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.

The story in LUST CAUTION is well done and the actors did a phenomenal job. Tony Leung (the actor from INFERNAL AFFAIRS aka the original version of THE DEPARTED)is a good actor as always. But I was most impressed with first-time actress Tang Wei. Her portrayal of her character really moved me.

I watched this in its original NC-17 format at the theater. Once again, this film reminded me of the beauty of the "freedom" of expression and art through cinema.

Sadly, many will dismiss this movie because of the sex. My question to all is this: ARE YOU SCARED OF THE HUMAN BODY SO MUCH THAT YOU WOULD DISMISS A MOVIE BECAUSE OF THE NATURAL BEAUTY OF SEX?
Audiences have no problem watching violence in Saving Private Ryan, Kill Bill, Good Fellas, or any of the numerous violent horror films. They have no problem watching $10 million dollar rump-shaking music videos and all the raunch that it entails.
BUT the moment a sexual scene is introduced in film, people get "uncomfortable" (aka Scared) and instead of standing strong and appreciating the FACT that we're able to let directors & actors be realistic in their approach to the NATURAL life act of sex, we instead feel the need to "look down" on sexual content.

This movie is for "The Big People." If you're not mature enough (can't handle it) then go watch DENNIS THE MENACE or HOME ALONE

I recommend this film to all who enjoy good story telling and just a good suspenseful movie in general. But that's ONLY if a naked human body doesn't offend you. (make you scared)

For OPEN-MINDED AUDIENCES ONLY
