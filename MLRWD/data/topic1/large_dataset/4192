I don't understand what all the fuss is about!  This movie ruled!!!  It is definitely one of the best science fiction movies ever made.  
This movie revolves around Amy, a gorilla who is taught sign language by an American zoologist.  The American also invented a device that Amy wears around her wrist to covert her signs into audible English.  Amy and the American communicate on a daily basis until one day when Amy tells him she wants to go back to her home in the Congo.
So Amy, the American, and African tribesmen take Amy back to her homeland.  Along the way they encounter various hazards such as a river filled with mean hippos, etc.  There's a great scene while they are on the river when the tribesmen start signing "California Dreaming" by the Mamas and the Papas.  It was really amazing that they knew the words, seeing as how they'd lived their entire lives in the jungles of Africa.
Also, I have to give credit to the special effects people.  Amy and the other apes look totally realistic!  Furthermore, the voice coming out of the sign language-to-English language converter around Amy's wrist was fantastic.  It was not really annoying or anything like that.
In any event, I highly recommend this movie.  The special effects are awesome and the story is enthralling.  You love the ending!
