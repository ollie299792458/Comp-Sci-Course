In his eulogy as song "NY Doll", Robyn Hitchock sang, "People touch you.  How do I explain?"  This sentiment could also apply to this truly wonderful look at the life, more the latter life, of Arthur "The Killer" Kane.  And what an intriguing picture it paints of this former New York Doll and glam/punk-rock icon.  The Arthur Kane most of us knew was the bedazzled, lurching creature that anchored the New York Dolls in the 1970s, a quiet foil to David Johansen's flamboyant stage persona (think of the dynamic between John Entwhistle and Roger Daltry, or lack thereof,  and you get the idea).  In fact, Kane was once referred to as "the only living statue in rock-and-roll."

But this film brings Kane into sharp focus in the early 2000s.  Not the drug casualty that rumor had him to be, and certainly not anything like his former self in the Dolls, aside from the lumbering, stoic demeanor being still evident.  No, the Killer was alive & well, a recovering alcoholic who had been sober for years, and was now working as a volunteer librarian in the genealogy center at the Los Angeles Temple for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  It is truly an odd vision to see this man, known for his outlandish glam attire and frothy hairdo, appearing as a way more than normal man in a white dress shirt and tie.  And that's where the film starts to get really interesting.

To say more would do an injustice to the beauty of this tale of Kane's last years.  Needless to say, though, it is a true story that is both sad and heart-warming in the most human and least expected of ways.  "People matter," Robyn Hitchcock sang, "and then they go again."
