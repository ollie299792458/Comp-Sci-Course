My favorite actor is Alan Rickman and I often see his movies, so that' why I chose this movie. He plays a hairdresser, Phil, who had won the British national hairdressing championships twice in a row. However, Phil missed winning the third time because his wife Shelley (Natasha Richardson) ran off with her lover Sandra (Rachel Griffiths), who is their hairdressing model, so he retired from the front line. In this movie, his performance is excellent! The image of him raising his scissors is very cool!!
The writer (Simon Beaufoy) wrote the movie "The Full Monty", too. Both films have "bonds" as their themes. I have never seen his other works, but I think that he is skilful at describing bonds, and I like his works. Their family bond, which was patched up through the hairdressing championships moved me. Moreover, I was very impressed with the scene in which Phil talks with Sandra in bathtub on the top of a hill. There are some funny scenes. In particular, the West Yorkshire mayor is the funniest! Sometimes he made me laugh, but the championship was not so exciting. Also, all hairdressers' works are gaudy. 
In this movie, Rachel Griffiths is so attractive that she's become one of my favorite¬Å@actresses, and I want to see her in other movies.
After seeing "Blow Dry", you will surely want to go to a hair salon!
