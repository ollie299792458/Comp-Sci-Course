"The Man Who Would Be King" is on the short list of my favorite films.  John Huston's love & dedication to this project really shines through (he had to wait 25-30 years to make it & then almost died making it)in his script & direction. Caine & Connery ARE Peachy & Danny (I'm sorry--I can't see Bogart & Gable) in what I see as career high performances.  Some eight years ago this was one of the very first DVDs I ever purchased. After viewing it numerous times since then, I have just watched it for the first times on a 42" widescreen lcd tv. I have to say that I was surprised at how good the image was for such an old release--the DVD was released in 1997--however there is room for considerable improvement in the package. First & foremost get rid of the flipper disc, the film is 129 minutes long & can easily be fit on a dual layer dvd with room to spare for a commentary (by a critic/historian & perhaps Mr. Caine--I doubt if Mr. Connery would make himself available.) Next, reinstate the short bit at the climax showing Danny tumbling end over end with Peach narrating his fall from the bridge--it was there when I first saw the film in 1975, but is missing from television & DVD prints for some reason. Documentary material on Kipling, the short story, John Huston & the making of the film & its importance would be most welcome. As it is, there are practically no extras on the extentant disc. Please Warner Bros.--won't you at least consider it.  When you look at all the double & triple dips of junk out there, give this film a little respect. Wontcha, huh?
