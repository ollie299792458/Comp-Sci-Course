It's taken some years for me to warm up to this film, but it's become one of the Moore Bond films that I'll go back to quite a bit more than the ones that proceed it (with the possible exception of FYEO).  It has plenty of ridiculous moments, but it is overall pleasing to my person.

Seeing as this review is about the PRODUCT and not the MOVIE ITSELF, 1 star is more than appropriate considering the HORRENDOUSLY-made DVD I have in my collection.  I purchased the disc second hand a few years back and it's absolutely scratch-free (on both sides) but it doesn't work AT ALL.

I'm sure if I had typed this review back in 1998-2000 I'd have a much higher opinion of the disc, but now that the "laser rot" has reared its ugly head it's completely useless!  I just hope that the companies that manufactured these discs (and all of the other CDs, DVDs and the Laserdiscs of yesteryear out there that are now coasters of varying sizes) have changed their fabrication practices for modern disc formats or have completely gone under.

If you pick up a copy of this disc, BUYER BEWARE!  You most likely have a COASTER on your hands.
