I just watched this movie again, and actually enjoyed it. For 1979 it was something different then the shoot 'em up Star Wars movies. Unlike those, TMP had something of a philosophical undertone.

The movie has been called slow moving and boring, but I think it suceeds where other Star Trek movies fail: it portrays the realism of space very well. Everything moves along slowly, there is very little "noise" of the ships racing around, as there wouldnt becuase there is no noise in space. This is the first connection to that other great science fiction classic: 2001 a Space Odyessey. The other connection is the special effects, especially when the Enterprise is moving through V'ger.

I dock the movie a star for two things: 1 the uniforms and 2 the acting. the former are among the worst ever in Star Trek and were wisely replaced by the classier looking uniforms in Star Trek 2-6. And the acting, WOW, it is way below what the actors, even Shatner, would develop in later movies. Shatner in particular is the negative for the acting criteria. His moves are to jerking and his speech has to many pauses.

These two things aside, TMP is great. We have the best looking Enterprise ever, until the Enterprise E in First Contact. We have the same interplay between the actors as we had in the Original Series. And as stated above, the philosophical element is good and this is what has allowed Star Trek to succeed above Star Wars. The idea that this massive complex machine like "V'ger" is compared to a child is interesting. So in conclusion, dont overlook this movie, its not as bad as you may have been led to believe.
