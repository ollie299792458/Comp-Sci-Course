I thought that this movie was a very good portrayal of the conflict  between Mary, QOS and Elizabeth.  Though they never really met each other  face to face (as they did twice in the movie for a short time) the movie  gives a pretty good idea of the opinion each had of the other.  Also, the  story of Mary's struggle for power and her eventual tragic failier is  facinating.  I also think that Glenda Jackson played a great part as  Queen Elizabeth.  She certainly has a good deal of experience in this role,  as she also played Elizabeth in the wonderful television series, Elizabeth  R.  In my opinion, she had the best role in the movie and played it  extremely well.  Elizabeth is arguably the best character because she must  struggle with the fact that she is always "living under the  shadow" of Mary.  She also has to deal with Mary as a rival to the  English throne and a danger to herself, but does not want to have to kill  her.  However,  she is eventually forced to execute her. the movie ends  just after she has died, with the moving sight of Elizabeth, crying while  holding Mary's prayerbook that she took to her execution.  The movie was  perhaps not entirely accurate as a history lesson, but gives a good insight  into the conflict between the two queens, and is a facinating tale.  All in  all, I really enjoyed the movie, and I think many others will as well,  particularly if they are interested in the subject.  If you liked this  movie then I would recomend any others about the same period of history.  I  found that most of these movies or television series are similar in their  great level of acting, and every one of them is a new and interesting  story.  Anne of the Thousand Days, Elizabeth R, and Lady Jane are just a  few that I would recomend to anyone interested in Tudor history.
