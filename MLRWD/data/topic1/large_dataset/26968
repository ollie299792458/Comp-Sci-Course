The first disc is the story of finishing SMILE.  It begins with a good background of the early days of the Beach Boys and why Brian stopped touring to concentrate on writing and producing for the band.  What to this day blows me away is how much responsibility he shouldered at such a young age.  There may have been five Beach Boys, he may have had some help with writing some of the songs, but essentially there was no band without Brian.  His creativity matured at a much faster pace than the rest of the boys, too fast.  Add an over-bearing dad who was incompetent as manager, you understand why he had a nervous breakdown.

The resurfacing of the SMILE project takes over the rest of disc one, understandably so.  And the rest of the disc is great, especially when SMILE debuts in London.  Taking into account everything Brian Wilson went through for close to 40 years, it's hard to believe he would choose to debut SMILE on such a large, world stage, but he did.  And probably the most incredible thing of all is not that the debut of SMILE was successful, but that it was such a complete triumph.  And he pretty much took that in stride, which also blew me away.  My wife watched this with me, and although not a fan of the Beach Boys, was really caught up in Brian's story and enjoyed it a lot.

Disc 2 is the SMILE concert, not the London debut, though.  I wish it was, but I'm not complaining. Great concert, and when it's done, you just have to wonder what kind of reception it would have received back in 1966-67 when he was trying to put it together and the band was resisting him.  I would imagine SMILE would have been mentioned in the same breath as Sgt. Pepper and the Beach Boys may have rivaled the Beatles for a few more years rather than what really happened.

I'd pay the money for the first disc alone.  Highly recommended.
