This movie opens in Guatemala's countryside.  The beautiful scenery, marimba music sharply contrast the country's civil war and the military's attempt at genocide of the indigenous people.  Rosa and Enrique decide to escape Guatemala for the US (El Norte).  The trek through Mexico, the coyotes, border patrol, "la migra", the fear they live with, prejudices and attempt to assimilate in the new culture; make this a poignant, moving and compelling film.
This is a great film, rich in symbolism. The storyline is sensitive and memorable.  Especially now with all these immigration talks and fears, this film can lead to great discussions and the need to be more tolerant and human with each other.
Even though this movie is slightly dated, (made in the 80's) so much of it still holds true today.  Many people dream of a new life here only to find a new struggle.  Even the opportunities they find usually include low-paying jobs in food industry, housekeeping and landscaping.  I highly recommend this movie.
