Sam Raimi returns to his original roots with Drag Me To Hell, a horrific story of a young girl that is cast with a spell from a gypsy lady that will mark a 3 day torture before being taken by the beast to hell for eternity. Whoever knows how Sam works and has witnessed his previous motion pictures like The Evil Dead and Army Of Darkness can relate these mentioned flicks with this one. At some point throughout the movie you will literally laugh due to its unrealism situation and gross encounter with the main actress and the circumstances she's come abound. Not a movie to be taken serious as The Exorcist or The Amityville Horror (just to give an example).

The movie paces well and it is energized, keeping you to the edge of your seat hoping for poor Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) to find the proper spell or ritual to rid her from this eternal curse. Some scenes will be disturbing but not grotesque, making it more like clich&eacute;d (basically what Sam Raimi was aiming for).

Overall highly entertaining, a good reason to stay home on a weekend night.
