The movie's two greatest assets are its look and actress. The movie is gold-soaked and amber-hued, the very color of nostalgia and suited perfectly to beautiful blondes. Streep is matchless protraying a wreck of a  woman, Sophie. Her Polish accent and German (!!) are flawless, and there is  never a false moment or move in her performance as a emotionally and  spiritually damaged woman who "survived" the Holocaust and the  concentration camps. Kevin Kline is magnetic as Nathan, her passionate,  grandiose and occasionally deranged lover. And Peter MacNicol is youthful  as the brash Southern would-be writer who falls in their orbit. The film's  flaws are its pacing (deadly slow) and the ending. The "choice"  the title refers to is put off so long that when it finally happens in  flashback, the only feeling is not of discovery or dramatic climax, but of,  "Well, finally!" And the ending is badly managed and seemed  tacked on without regard to dramatic context and rather formulaic. The end  isn't the dramatic climax, rather just a way to finish off the movie. Watch  this movie if you want to see some good (and great) actors work their magic  in a film that doesn't quite work as cinema should. It's an actor's flick.
