The movie that started it all. The closeups, the battle scences, the highly involved and intricate story, all tolled make this a truly groundbreaking and classic film.  The direction of David Wark Griffith is  superb, and no one in 100 years of movies has been able to top the grace,  beauty, elegance and out and out talent of Lillian Gish. Henry Walthall  also gave a performance which most assuredly would have won an Oscar had  the award been around for 1915.  The only drawback to the film is the  totally ridiculous portrayal of African Americans in the film. Whatever  Thomas Dixon and D W Griffith were drinking to buy into such fantasy and  discriminatory drivel is hard to comprehend. However, this film, like many  other things, should not be banned. Yes it is disgusting and insulting, but  it is a window to our not so distant past, where many Americans, including  President Wilson, believed that what was in this film was fact. It was  partial fact poured over with personal opinion and prejudices.  This does  not take away from the film. Considering the revival of the klan in the  1910s and 1920s, one can see how much impact a film like this contributed  to everyday American life. We must treasure it for what it is, a  groundbreaking film which redifened films for all time, and caused films to  come of age. Only one other film before 1940 (Gone With The Wind) made over  $10 million at the box office - see why, for this is a must see classic.
