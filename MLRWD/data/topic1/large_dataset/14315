I have watched the show both in prime-time and on syndication, and if I had to say one thing about it to sum it up, I would say this: you have to be pretty intelligent to be able to follow it in all of it's complexities. The situations, dialogue, and personality quirks or the characters are something that I think could only be comprehended fully by an extremely smart 12th grader or a person who has either gone to college, or read a ton of books, or lived on the streets of NY. You have to know what "He got shanked in Riker's" means. If you think a shank is something you put in your soup, and you don't know what/where Rikers is, the show can be frustrating. The characters often speak in riddles and use sarcasm not easily understood by the perps even! You have to have a basic understanding of police and criminal procedure, investigations, etc. and symbolism. In any given episode there are usually two new cases and a continuation of one or two storylines that have been ongoing, so, unlike Law & Order, if you just sit down and turn it on, you can get lost right off the bat. Checking the episode guides online will help, but you need to know the characters personalities as well! Sipowicz is old-school. Medavoy is melodramatic. Diane is kind of hesitant, Jill is much less tense. My personal favorite, James Martinez (played by the versatile Nicholas Turturro), unfortunately did not stay with the show through the run. Catch the reruns on TNT!
