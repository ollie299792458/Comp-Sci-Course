This is a movie that won't appeal to many people, because of the bad beginning, bad ending, and lack of letting you know, what the crap is going on and such feelings as "why should I feel sorry for the guy". They don't get emotion through to you very well and you just wish they gave you more to like by the end of the film. The film also has a very "pointless" quality to it. My father saw this movie and told me it was literally watching a guy watch static for 2 hours, and essentially that is all that's going on for much of the movie. Yeah.....he hated it, but I didn't. I thought it was okay.

Alright, with the negative aside, they did have a pretty good cast, even though, I've never heard of everyone except Michael Keaton. I also found the movie to be quite creepy. I've seen the movie twice and I wasn't scared in the least bit the second time. This is just one of those movies that you should rent because it's more about the impression you have of the movie over the reasons for liking it or disliking it. Just looking at the pros and cons to this movie, I'd probably say that I'd hate it, but I didn't so I'd say you should rent it and then see what you think.
