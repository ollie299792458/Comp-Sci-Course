Being a Sherlock Holmes fan for nearly two decades now, I've read every one of Doyle's stories and have seen a ton of different versions of Holmes and Watson.  Basil Rathbone was far too stiff, Nigel Bruce far too idiotic.  A few other actors were entertaining but didn't quite meet up to task (though Peter Cushing took hold of my heart for writing on his cuff - So very Holmes, that!).  Jeremy Brett has always been my all time favorite portrayer of the role... until now.

Downey's Holmes and Law's Watson are flawless, especially when you consider that all the Holmes stories except for two are written from Watson's point of view.  (Seriously, people, if you were writing about your best friend, would you tell them EVERYTHING about them?  Or would you couch your words to be as gentle, if honest, as possible?)  The Holmes in this film is the Holmes in the stories: a drug addict, a recluse until something catches his attention, suspicious of women (his behavior towards both Irene Adler and Mary Morstan reflects this), an expert fighter, deliberately "forgetful" when it's to his advantage, manipulative, impulsive, and extremely irritating but, at the same time, devoutly loyal to his friends, even if he may taunt them mercilessly.  Equally, we see the Watson as he was written in the stories: organized, caring, intelligent (something often neglected in other films), patient (with Holmes, you really have to be) but only to a point, and most importantly loyal.  The line in the movie that best describes Holmes and Watson is "Brother not in blood but in bond" and that is what you get with this movie.

I can absolutely guarantee this is one DVD that is going to get played a TON!
