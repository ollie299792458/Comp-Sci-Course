As I wound down copying or replacing all of my vhs tapes, I was left with about 100 "question marks."  Since this 100 was rarely shown on tv, should I let them go or buy dvd copies.  The Doctor fell into this category.  Especially, since I rarely see it being played on tv, I bought a used copy on Amazon and I am glad I did.

I had forgotten how moving the film is and most important, how strong the actors made these characters.  To be sure, there is some predictability in the story of a self-important, detached doctor who finds himself in the patient role. On my recent re-viewing of this film what struck me is how much more relevant the story is now, with non-caring insurance companies determining the treatments we receive.  Today, uncaring doctors are actually the LEAST of our problems!

Another eye-opener is that this movie apparently was never widely released in a dvd format.  I couldn't believe the cost for a Region 1 dvd of this film!  The most reasonable copy I found was a Region 2, so I snapped it up.

By the way, lots of obscure movies are available on Region 2 and Phillips has a region free dvd player for around $40 - well worth it. Bought it on Amazon too.

William Hurt, Christine Lahti, Mandy Patinkin, Alan Arkin and Elizabeth Perkins - all fantastic; a thought-provoking subject; the ever-stunning backdrop of San Francisco - what more could one want?
