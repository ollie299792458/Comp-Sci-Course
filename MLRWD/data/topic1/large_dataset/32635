This movie has what many lack...heart.  Yes, it is long, and I'm sure there will be many complaints about that.  However, it is not too long, but actually just the right length of time to develop the story AND keep the viewer's interest.
The acting is formidable, especially by Hopkins.  His character truly does posess many qualities that the average person should strive for...a commanding leadership and presence, honesty, sincerity, love for his friends and family, intelligence, and respect.  Hopkins portrays this character with both flair and subtlety, which is not an easy task to pull off.
Pitt gets stuck with an even more imposing task while trying to pull of the character of Death.  Overall, I think he does just fine in a tough role.
Forlani is just beautiful, and it is just so easy to fall in love with her in this movie...I know I did.  Her tenderness and loving nature only reinforced her beauty.  None of her films since have been able to drive me crazy about her the way this one does...
Most important, and sometimes overlooked, is the chemistry that these actors had on stage together.  They worked extremely well together.  What more can I say..."Meet Joe Black" is a fine movie that most will enjoy.  Oh yeah, and the sets and scenery (especially that of the mansion) were phenomenal.  Go watch it if you haven't seen it yet.  Watch it again if you have...
