This is a really great film to take your kids to, and most adults would enjoy it aswell.  Not only is it an enjoyable watch, but it's packed full of inspiration and life lessons that all kids need to push themselves to challenge their potencial, perhaps they can do more than they think.  The crowded theater laughed outloud as spelling competitors came to life on the screen.  The fierce competition to win brought to life the believability and querkiness that kids are made of.  I was hesitant about taking 3 boys to the theater to see a "girlie" movie, however, all three boys between the ages of 8 and 12 laughed and were smiling after leaving the theater.  This is a story of an impoverished black girl with a mother too busy to notice her achievements and a father who's passed who shares her love of spelling.  At times, it seems, her father is her biggest supporter, until she stumbles upon a special friend who agrees to coach her to the national finals.  As she trains for the regional and then national competitions, Akeelah finds herself making a new class of friends, unlike her limited all black school friends.  She broadens her vision to understand there aren't colors that separate friends.  Akeelah has the talent to compete as she's able to memorize thousands of word spellings, what language they're derived from, and their application, but she must learn to develop confidence to rise above her opposing competition who are spoiled with more priveledged education and opportunity.  Some of the parents of the spellers are living out their childhood dreams through their children and find that their proding only gets them so far.  There's a message for those parents here.  I loved the underdog in this story because Akeelah has nothing going for her but her will, and it proves to be enough to go up against the best in the national spelling bee.  You'll fall in love with Akeelah and the Bee!

RECOMMENDED!
