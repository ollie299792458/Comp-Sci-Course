I just chanced upon this wonderful war-based adventure-thriler last night.As it title has already said,the movie is about a young US navy navigator who struggles for survival after his fighter plane was shot down in war-torn Bosnia.

Here,Owen Wilson plays Chris Burnett,the navigator who has to flee from the local soldiers,dart behind trees and play dead.It was quite a thrill as you watched him running up and down,hanging for his dear life.However,in the second half of the movie,you began to feel for Burnett as he struggles to seek help from the US navy army via his little sensory phone (or whatever signal that you call it).You also began to to feel the various obstacles he faced as he struggles to survive inthe cold,alone in a total foreign land,with the lack of machinery weapons and tools.It sure wasn't easy for Burnett,with his enemies hot on his heels,with a very stoic,determined hitman,eager to have Burnett dead.

Gene Hackman's portrayal of a commander is also convincing as he pledges to save Burnett's life,going against the rules and orders of his superiors.

It was endrearing to see Owen Wilson in a serious role,where he plays the navigator Burnett.After all,the actor's recent roles in recent years were mostly based on the comedy genre (READ: Shanghai Knights,The Wedding Crashers,Starsky&Hutch).Watching BEHIND ENEMY LINES has allow me to give credits to Wilson as an actor. After all,he did a pretty good job in a convincing portrayal as Chris Burnett,whose auick-witted thinking saves the day,as he struggles for survival in a war torn area,behind enemy lines.
