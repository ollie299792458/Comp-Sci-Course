I am so sick of people using the words PC or NON PC  to describe a piece of artistic expression...they are words created by the  the standards and practices police who tell you what they think is acceptable.Yes Blazing Saddles uses the so called N-Word... it also uses many words offensive to many races... i notice many  reviewers don't seem to notice the other words...that aside  you need to recognize  whose mouths these words are coming out of...ignorant frontier folk afraid of anything foreign...they are not children...they are not completely off the mark in their portrayal of the ignorance  and bigotry that was pervasive in  ,well, most of US history.If you have a problem with the "fictional" racism in this movie  perhaps you should go to a library and read the  books about sacco and vanzetti or the plight of native americans swindled and practically killed off...When one of the characters says"dock that Ch--- a days pay" his savagery is like a punch in the stomach it makes you uncomfortable AND IT SHOULD!!! or when the elderly lady tells  sheriff bart "up yours' N-----" when  all he is doing is  wishing her good day ...his pain is tangible because even someone who should be more wise than most degrades him... This
parody is light reading compared to the real thing...there are many many funny moments in this movie ...but remember this is not just a parody of western movies,,,it is a parody  of american history...not normally a subject of hilarity due to it's many painful chapters  for many races...
If you can't handle the truth mixed with  humourous intelligent  observations about  racism and stereotyping  perhaps you should stay away...p.s. to all those who say this not for young ones..i say that if you want your child to have a better view of what ignorance really is have them watch this movie and explain to them that the views of the racist characters are wrong...children don't need to be protected they need to be educated and schools don't cut it when it comes to enlightenment
