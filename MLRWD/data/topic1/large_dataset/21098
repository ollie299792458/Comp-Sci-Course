John Huston's directorial debut nails every single possible angle for a great movie: a great hero in Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade, here making a major transition from the gangster roles that made him famous; a great set  of villains, from Sydney Greenstreet's ponderous Gutman to Peter Lorre's  effeminate Joel Cairo to Elisha Cook's almost cartoonish gunman Wilmer; a  great femme fatale in Mary Astor's Brigid O'Shaunessy; a great hunt, in the  quest for the fabled Maltese Falcon.  Shot scene for scene out of the novel  (with some notable cuts of extraneous material, such as a long story Sam  tells Brigid while they're waiting, and Gutman's daughter!), "The  Maltese Falcon" is utterly clean, economical film-making with no fat  whatsoever (except for Gutman, of course).  The movie creates a tense  atmosphere from its opening shots, with ironic humor simply acting as  counterpoint throughout.  The final scenes of revelation, where Sam  explains to Brigid his personal code of honor, are as emotionally  devastating today as they were fifty years ago.  The last shots of the  movie, as Brigid descends in the elevator quickly to her fate, while Sam  takes the stairs, suggests each character is heading to their own private  hell, even if at different speeds.  A brilliant movie!
