Everyone ranted and raved about this flick.  Of course, it's an indie horror flick, so I wasn't expecting it to be superb.  I went in with little to no expectations: and amazingly, I was still let down.
First the good news: the first half (or less than half) of the film was actually pretty good.  We're introduced to the two outcast sisters, pulling their antics for attention, and getting hell from their classmates.  If we had been given some sort of plot to follow through on this it could've ended up being a good film.  Additionally, the acting is above par, especially the lead.
Unforunately, once we're introduced to the supernatural element (extraordinarily lame effects) of the "werewolf", it all goes downhill.  The plot is tossed together as they go along and the drugdealer ends up being the hero.  He's one of the better characters, but he's not nearly enough to pull it out of the gutter.
I give it one star for the acting, and another for the possibility it showed in the beginning.  I'd give it another star for utilizing the werewolf (my favorite monster) but they did such a disgustingly horrendous job with it (the only horror I was assaulted with in the film) that I can't in good conscience promote it.
I don't own it and I never will.  Luckily I didn't pay for the rental either.
