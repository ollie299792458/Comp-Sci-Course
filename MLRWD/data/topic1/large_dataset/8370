I got this movie for Christmas yesterday and I love it!  I have seen the movie "Chicago" many times and have seen the Broadway musical many times on a tape I have.  This is probably the most likeable of all of them because it's clean.  They had to follow the Hays Code with motion pictures back then, so that certainly added to its cleanliness.  The movie is a version of "Chicago" that all members of the family can enjoy, unlike the current movie and stage show which are only appropriate for ages 13 and up.  Ginger Rogers seems perfect for Roxie because she gives off believable innocence, unlike Reinking or Zellwegar who not only killed their lovers, but also were too fake for the role.  Reinking talked too fast and Zellwegar was just not the right choice.  Rogers is a great Roxie, because she is just like the one in the original play, even though the musical's version is based on Rogers's incarnation.  This is my favorite type of movie anyway because I'm a fan of old black&amp;white movies.
