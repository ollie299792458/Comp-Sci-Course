So it's midnight and I'm at a friend's house eating popcorn and we're about to watch a Harrison Ford movie. Normally, I wouldn't even need a title because "Harrison Ford movie" is usually persuading enough for me. This movie is no Air Force One, and is certainly no Star Wars, and Ford's performance in the film was just about as dissapointing as the film itself.

It's really just your basic Bad-guy-kidnaps-family-and-holds-them-hostage-until-they-get-cash type of plot, except written by a 10-year old. Try not to get bored to death sitting through the first 30 minutes of pointless information regarding Ford's character's job, such information which has no effect on any storyline in the rest of the movie.

Paul Bettany plays an ideal villan, but the usual villan hires cronies, cronies become nice, villan kills cronies sub-plot is evident in too many hostage movies. To tell the truth, the main reason I watched this was not for Harrison Ford, but for the ever-so-tainted secretary Mary-Lynn Rajskub. The "24" star and stand-up comedian is an idol of mine, and while I was hoping she'd get her first big break, this wasn't quite it.

Without spoiling the movie, Firewall is nothing but 'just-another-wannabe-action-film.'
