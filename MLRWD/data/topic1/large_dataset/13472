On paper, "Nacho Libre" must have looked like a match made in heaven: why not combine the heartfelt quirkiness of "Napoleon Dynamite" with the high-energy, cross-generational appeal of "School of Rock"? The producers even brought in the writer of "School of Rock." Unfortunately, it doesn't work. On the positive side, Jack Black is always riveting and gives everything he's got, and director Jared Hess delivers some great moments reminiscent of "Napoleon Dynamite" (whose fans might also enjoy the overt references). The problem is that the film is essentially aimed at 12-year-old males. Whereas the music in "School of Rock" struck a chord with audiences of all ages (who doesn't dig AC/DC?), wrestling scenes just don't appeal to most adults, particularly the indie crowd. Also missing was a strong female character to balance out Jack Black, like Joan Cusack's hilarious principal in "School of Rock." Ana de la Reguera is drop-dead gorgeous, but her nun character is underwritten and doesn't have much to say. The formulaic plot is less than compelling, and my friends and I enjoyed watching the making-of featurettes more than we did the movie.
