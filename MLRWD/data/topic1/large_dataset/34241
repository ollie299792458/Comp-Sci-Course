It is purely coincidental that the backdrop for this movie happens to be high school basketball or sports of any kind: This is a genuinely great movie, leaving the audience feeling good about themselves and willing to search for a second chance at success in life, no matter how great the  failure. A one-word description of the movie? REDEMPTION. This theme runs  throughout, i.e., a second chance...for the town drunk, for the coach, for  the wannabe assistant coach, for the old-maid school teacher, for the team,  for Jimmy Chitwood, for the drunk's son, for Strap, for the town, for the  principal, for the players who quit, for the equipment manager, for the  school bus...with the movie on video, you now have a second chance to watch  and enjoy this great movie! It is worth the redemption price! If you  already have seen it, after reading this review you may see it through a  different perspective; if you have not seen it, I know you will thoroughly  enjoy it, over and over again. Hoosiers is not just my favorite sports  movie, it is my favorite movie of all time. The movie truly is about  redemption, about people failing and being given a second chance. Some  handle it better than others, but it cuts a true slice out of life in the  1950s and the 2000s! We should all get that kind of second chance! The best  part is, we do. Those who succeeded in Hoosiers accepted  their second chance and made something of it. I watch this movie any time  that life hands me a setback or any time that I fail or fall. It is a  better pick-me-up than any anti-depressant. So, wipe your slate clean and  watch Hoosiers again for the first time!
