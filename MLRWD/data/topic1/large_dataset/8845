My ESL students and I are just now completing reading The Diary of Anne  Frank.  Last week, we viewed the video to compare the two.  We found many  differences.  For example, in the video, Mr. Van Daan smokes a lot.  In the  book, Anne does not talk about him smoking a lot.  In the video, only 2  "protectors" spend any time visiting the Secret Annex.  In the  book, there are four.  We listed many differences, but we all agreed - the  feeling, the suffering, and the overall story are the same.  It doesn't  matter if some details are different; the horrifying story remains the  same!  And, as one student said to me after class, "I not only  suffered with the people, but I decided the problems in my life aren't  important.  We learn what real suffering is.  I also learned what it was  like to be a teenager again!"  Anne's problems growing up are  universal.  The book should be read by people of different ages and  countries. It is a teenager's story in an unbelievable, but real situation!  It is worthwhile reading and viewing for everyone!  We must never forget!
