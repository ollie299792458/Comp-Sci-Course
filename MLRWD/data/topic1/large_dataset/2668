VILLAGE....

I first saw 'Village Of The Damned' on a late show on TV back in 1971. I had never heard of this movie before then. Whole town suddenly passes out, nobody knows why, okay, I was mildly interested in it. And then, these strange kids are born. Okay, the flick's getting better. And these babies are serious! They don't smile, cry, or anything. Suddenly, one of them is provoked by another kid, and now his eyes are glowing! The bully kid turns and sees another one of the strange kids, and now her eyes are glowing too! And with that, this flick went from being "mildly interesting" to being one of those creepy classics that I couldn't watch late at night....for years. Within no time, these kids took over the whole town. And these kids were all business, right up to the end. Anybody stepped out of line, all it took was that glowing glare to eradicate any infidels, usually by suicide. This flick had one of the best endings that I've ever seen in a sci-fi movie. A very well made, very intelligent flick that explored the question of alien life-forms invading the Earth via artificial insemination. After I saw this for the first time, it was bedtime right after it went off, and all I saw in the darkness was those floating, glowing eyes.

CHILDREN....

I saw 'Children Of The Damned' in the mid-70's on the 4:30 Movie (NY), and to this day, I can't remember a single thing about it. Obviously, it didn't leave much of an impact the way 'Village' did.
