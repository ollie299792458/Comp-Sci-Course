The Killing, being Stanley Kubrick's first big film, is hardly one you can call your everyday run of the mill film. This classic film is about a group of cons led by Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) who plan to rob the racetrack during the 7th race by timing all of the steps taken with precision and skill. The great thing about this film though was how Kubrick used the timing of the plan to his advantage when filming and telling the story. All the jumps back and forth give it a very strong "Oceans 11" feel. The plan is set out for you in the story however, but the greatest part of this film is watching their demise as certain things go wrong.

This is one of the big film noir movies I would recommend to anyone who likes mystery, intensity and a driving plot that keeps you on your toes the whole movie. Although this is a classic film noir, the lighting, which is normally that key element used to dramatize it more, is rarely used. More than half the movie based during the day outside. So it is safe to say that this film word by word could be adopted to color very easily keeping the same mystery and drama that goes with it.

Not many heist movies take place around a racetrack, so the plot was fresh even though shot in 1956. Anyone who enjoys Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, or Orsen Wells will love this movie. It has all the elements of a film that sells big in the box office.
