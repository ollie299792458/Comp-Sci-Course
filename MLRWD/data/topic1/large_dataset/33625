I saw this movie for the first time at a Baptist College "movie night".  It scared the crap out of the girls and had the guys ROTFL. It was the first real horror flick I had seen other than a few vampire movies, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Dark Shadows, etc.  Gotta be the cheesiest monster I've ever seen.  The bear (what's up with a grizzly bear in Maine????) looks like a wax dripped latex CHUD and never mind that it never seems to walk on all fours.  It runs around on 2 legs the whole movie, marping hikers, loggers and smacking kids in exploding down-filled sleeping bags- one of the funniest scenes in a poorly done horror movie I've ever seen.  I guess the director put that scene in there so it would give it something to remember it by.  Also, the large blue 12ft trout was great.  No one can explain why you'd want to take 2 nasty small dead and dying mutant bear offspring home with you.  I guess that was for the 2nd movie that never happened.  (after the credits another bear almost jumps out of the screen at you.  Ranks up there with the B&W stuff from the late 50's and 60s.  But for laughs and cheesiness it is a good flick.
