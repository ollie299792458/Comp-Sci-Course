This movie was fairly awful to watch. I suppose in a very run-of-the-mill sort of way it was all right, but really, I hate this film. All it really said to me was, "Ed, man, I'm sorry, but it's over." With Fight Club, American History X, and Death to Smoochy, I really thought he had a promising career ahead of him, with consequential films, but why on earth did he agree to to this movie? It's basically Silence of the Lambs with Ed Norton instead of Jodie Foster. Oh wait! Accept that Silence of the Lambs was a lot better! This movie was so recycled and boring that I left feeling sorry for the people that had pretty good repertoire (Ralph Fiennes, Anthony Hopkins, and yes, Edward Norton) before this. 
Yeah, I can't get away from the Ed Norton thing. Why, Ed? I think I should write him a letter and ask him. I guess the rise and fall of Edward Norton can't be totally blamed on Red Dragon. Other contributors: The Score, 25th Hour, and The Italian Job really dug him into the grave and buried him alive.
