"Singin' in the Rain" is the crown jewel of the MGM musicals made between 1928 and 1960.  This is not a knock on the wonderful films that Fred Astaire made at MGM and other studio's, not at all, but without a doubt this one is the best synthesis of Broadway Musical and Hollywood extravaganza.  Made in stunning color just in time to keep audiences away from the first wave of TV sets, Hollywood had Gene Kelly tapping down everything he knew about dance into a fun little script about the old transition from 1920's flappers and silents to the new audio age.

It is so much fun to see the contrast between Donald O'Connor, the limber clown, and Gene Kelly the athletic man's man. Their dance is all about thrills and acrobatics, spectacular steps and synchronization.  Add young Debbie Reynolds, and the effect is pure entertainment.  Get up off your couch and start dancing on the dining room table.  Don't scare the wife and kids.

Much has been said about the sexy Cyd Charisse number.  Her long, long, green stocking legs made the boys uncomfortable in their theatre seats.  I think she was taller than Gene Kelly.  The Freudian, gauze in the wind scene is all about intercourse as much as the sensibilities of 1952 could handle.  It's burlesque, but ballet, or modern dance, combining at a time when Broadway was experimenting; Bob Fosse and others were choreographing the golden age of American stage musical.

In the end, sentimental, romantic, and ageless, SITR is in the top twenty films ever made.
