Fox Home Video should be congratulated for the fantastic restoration of this film. As my wife and I sat in our home theatre we saw our 10 foot wide screen filled with the most spectacular image of this 50 year old classic, I felt like we were seeing it for the first time. No need for 3D glasses, because the details and colors were so clear and vivid, we were practically IN the movie ourselves. The DTS soundtrack is exquisite as well. While the orchestra is playing we were completely surrounded by the different musical instruments, and when the actors spoke, the voice followed them from screen left to screen right perfectly. Even the theatrical trailer is restored to 1080p, and looks immaculate. I can barely wait to sit through all the special features in HIGH DEFINITION. I can only imagine the magic the audiences felt when this film premiered back in1959.
I just want to thank the restoration team at FOX for giving us this great gift for our collection. Congratulations for the BEST job yet!. I cannot wait for the other Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals to arrive on Blu-ray. I hope THE SOUND OF MUSIC is next in line!!! Thank You, Thank You, Thank You......!
