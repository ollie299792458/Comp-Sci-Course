The Haunted Mansion is a beautifully simple story about love, deceit, betrayal, and family, with a few ghosts added in for good measure. i especially love the subtlety in which the storyline addresses interracial relationships; bravo to Disney for taking on a storyline with a powerful message of universal love.
similar to viewing Pirates of the Caribbean, those who have made a tradition of riding The Haunted Mansion will be tickled to death ;-) at the little touches that was done to bring various parts of the ride to life. i found myself singing in the movie theatre to "grim grimmy ghosts about to socialize!" moreso, the movie has served as a powerful advertisement to visit a Disney theme park in the near future, as i hope to do this summer. i found myself anxiously waiting for the DVD, and, sure enough, i purchased my widescreen edition within the first week of distribution.
the extras on the DVD were also very informative and enlightening. i just ate everything up.
don't be surprised, however, if you actually get a little spooked while watching this movie. while its definitely no slasher horror film (thank goodness), it does have it's creepy moments. like it's themepark counterpart, there are parts of this visual ride that are both jovial and fun and parts that do bring a chill up your spine. 
enjoy this ride!
