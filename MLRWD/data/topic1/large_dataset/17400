I just saw RAY starring Jamie Foxx. I can't come up with enough glowing adjectives to describe Jamie Foxx's exemplary portrayal of Ray Charles. The Academy Awards should make an exception, and award Jamie Foxx with an Oscar at this time. This movie is destined to be a classic. As soon as the DVD comes out, I'll be buying one.

Ray Charles put Jamie Foxx through the paces, and was very pleased with Foxx and gave his blessings in portraying him on the big screen.

My father who passed away two years ago was a big Ray Charles fan. I became a big fan. My two sons are fans. I saw Ray Charles in an excellent concert a few years ago, and I must say that Jamie Foxx really captured the essence of my most favorite singer of all time. Jamie Fox appeared to be possessed by Ray Charles' Spirit.

Jamie Foxx and the supporting cast have made the movie of a lifetime. What a quintessential performance by Jamie Foxx!!!

Ray Charles has sung a lot of great songs, including Georgia on My Mind, which became the state of Georgia's state song.  Personally, I think that Ray Charles' rendition of America The Beautiful should be the national anthem for the U.S.
