I really don't enjoy exercising, let me just preface my review with that.  I like the way that I feel afterwards, and how my body looks when I am working on it, but I am not a fitness buff by any stretch of the mind.  This video made the time go by SO quickly!!  It is broken into 3 segments but if you select "play routine" or something on the main menu it just shuffles through the 3 sections without a break at all.  What I really liked about it was that there is a countdown timer in the bottom right hand corner that counts down the minutes.  I realize that I have a 30 minute workout to do, but the timer makes me feel like I never have more than 9 more minutes to go which encourages me to really push myself more than I would if it wasn't there.  I just say to myself that no matter how hard it is I can for sure push through another minute or two.  The instructor also does this thing where she does each move a couple of times slowly and then "brings it up to tempo".  Admittedly, I am not the world's most coordinated person and this made me be able to get the form down perfectly and really concentrate on doing the exercise correctly so I could get strength results from the video instead of just flailing around and just getting cardio.  I actually have to do the modifications on some sections during the video, which I have never needed to do on any other video.  Even though I feel like I am working past my capacity during the tape I wake up the next day feeling really tight and lean, especially in my core section, instead of in pain.  This is a great workout for your obliques, and none of it is done on the ground which I love.  The instructor is upbeat without being annoying, and has abs that make you want to keep exercising!  Overall, a great workout that is fun to do and great for your core.
