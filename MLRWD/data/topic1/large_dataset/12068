I watched this in my Film & Literature Of The American West class in college. When the professor described it, I didn't know what to think. All the actors sounded good (Henry Fonda, always good; Charles Bronson, so good; etc.), but then he mentioned that Henry Fonda was the villain in this particular movie. I didn't understand how it could work.

Henry Fonda is always the good guy. You can just see it in his eyes. How could he ever be believable as a villain? Well, it turns out he can. He turns his good-guy eyes into a fierce, piercing gaze for this film.

The film starts out with a really funny scene with some lesser-known entities (unless you're huge into westerns), including one man fighting a fly which keeps landing on his face. It's silent and deadpan, and funny. Until a train bearing a mysterious stranger arrives; then it's an immediate showdown.

The movie is slow at parts, but the characters and music keep you wanting more. The music in the movie is absolutely amazing; some of the most powerful music I've heard in a movie.

Overall, this is a classic western that any fan should see.
