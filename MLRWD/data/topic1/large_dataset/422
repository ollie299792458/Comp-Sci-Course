Getting ready for a long flight, I selected this DVD because I like Nicholas Cage and the trailers for this moving positioned it as a slightly funny movie as others here have mentioned.  After watching the movie, I was very impressed that the movie could explore a mysterious (to me) topic with all seriousness and sensitivity as well, taking on a semi-political message that is relevant for 2006 and beyond.

I had no idea what an arms dealers do, so I learned a lot from the movie which is based on a set of facts rather than being based in complete fiction.  The Yuri character shows some sensitivity and sadness but all of that is negated by the lure of big money, even when people close to Yuri are killed.  Emotional outpouring is temporary.  Yuri's blood must run ice-cold.

I didn't realize that governments funnel money to arms dealers who supply weapons to one or both sides of a war.  A sobering and irritating concept if it is really true.

I don't see many films that are enjoyable but also send a message.  This is a movie that was both to me.
