This movie is worth watching just for Sam Rockwell's performance of Kenny Waters, the innocent man who was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison with no parole.  Hillary Swank is good, as always.  As is Minnie Driver, Juliette Lewis, and Shea Wigham.  It's a good story, predictable, and schmaltzy at times, but still entertaining.  I'm a true crime junkie, and the conviction of innocent people always infuriates me.  The courts are so quick to lock someone up for life, or give them the death penalty.  But it practically takes an act of God to get an innocent person out.  Even after DNA exonerates them!  Read below if you want to be even more disgusted with what the state did to this innocent man.

SPOILER!!
What they don't tell you at the end of the movie is that Kenny Waters died from a fall six months after his release.  I don't know why they didn't add that to the end.  I felt lied to when I did a little research and found this out.  They really should have added it.  It makes the whole thing even more horrifying, awful, and incredibly sad.
