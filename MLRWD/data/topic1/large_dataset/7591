David Lynch's masterpiece film, Blue Velvet is an overpowering look at the evil that lurks amongst the normalities of everyday life.  Boiled down to the basics, Blue Velvet is a good-guys vs. bad-guys crime story, but the  subplots and emotional tensions create a film unlike any I have ever seen.  This is not a film for those who are easily disturbed by troubling images,  however, I think that anyone who watches it must be impressed by its total  originality in the way it tells a story.  As a matter of fact, this  film is much more accessible to film lovers than many of Lynch's other  films, in that the underlying plot is actually very straight-forward, and  wraps up in a logical conclusion.  Compare this to the mish-mash of  something like Lost Highway, and it is easy to see why Blue Velvet has been  hailed as such a brilliant piece of work.  I must admit that the acting  (except for Dennis Hopper's tremendous performance) overall is not of the  highest caliper, but the overall force of the story renders this a moot  point.  This is a great movie, and any film lover who has not yet seen it  should check out this fine DVD edition.
