Highlander's one of those movies where if you 'get it', you like it. It's more than obvious many people who have reviewed it didn't get it. The story was interesting, the cinematography was inspiring, and the Scotish landscapes were breathtaking. As far as the acting goes, yes they could have done better. But it didn't detract from the mood of the film. I have the original VHS, the director's cut VHS, and the widescreen director's cut DVD. In that I acquired each as they became available, I've never regreted their purchase. On picture and sound quality, yes the DVD could have been better. But, again, it's not enough to detract from the mood of the film. And let's make no mistake about it, this picture is about mood and feelings. As far as the Queen music goes -- well, let's just say I've never been a fan. But even so, "Who Wants to Live Forever" was quite appropriate for the sequence where it was played. And the Michael Kamen score (the orchestral pieces) is rousing and wonderful. I still don't care for the sequels or the series. But then, they are but shadows of what was attempted in the original movie. While the fight scenes weren't great (look at Crouching Tigar, Hidden Dragon for that), if you like a little swash and buckle, a little romance, some nice scenery, and an interesting story, I'd recommend this one.
