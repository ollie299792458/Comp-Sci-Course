My expectations of this movie were low - I expected something cute and fun and forgettable like "The Wedding Planner."  Well, this movie fell below even my low expectations.

JLo is awful.  She never could really act, but in her previous movie there was always a kind of sweetness and flakiness to her, and a sense that she was trying really hard, that made you forgive the bad acting and enjoy the movie anyhow.

But obviously her fame has gone to her head; here she comes across as arrogant and condescending to the audience - like she knows she's so important, she just can't be bothered to act.

Gere was okay - he comes across as a nice, kind of exhausted man.

Sarandon was good but why she would waste her phenomenal talent in this was beyond me.  The other supporting actors were much better and more fun.

For the reasons the other reviewers cite, the main premise of the movie just doesn't work in Chicago - there are plenty of professionals who take ballroom dancing, and its no big deal.  The idea of Gere keeping it hidden seemed completely contrived and fake, while I've heard it works beautifully in the original Japanese film, where the culture would require keeping the dancing hidden.  The fact that there was zero chemistry between Gene and Lopez didn't help.

If you see this, get it on video for $2.50 - or wait for its tv appearance.
