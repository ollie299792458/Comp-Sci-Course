In this double dvd package, Van Morrison proves he is THE if not one of the best POP Vocalists ever. He is magnificant. The band is also magnificant. I bought this dvd as a gift for someone, but couldn't resist. I played it and will keep it for myself and give a gift of second one.
 I've seen a few reviews complaining that Van seems disinterested. Those people obviously don't know Van very well. He never connects well with audiances and often appears as he has had 2 or 3 scotches before the performance. Simply listen to the concert and you'll know it's incredible. I have a 1080 resolution TV and a 5.1 surround sound home theater system. I own many concert dvd's.... this is the best! I paid less than $15 for this package and it may be the best 15 bucks I've ever spent in my life.
 Van's voice has deepened and aged over the years but this dvd is from '73 and '80 and the '80 set is basically the one I'm referring to in this review, although the '73 set is good.
 Don't listen to the fools who don't like seeing van with his eyes closed... the man is a genious and clearly rivals Sam Cooke as the greatest rythm and blues singer of all time!
