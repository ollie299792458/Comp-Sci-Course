This is the kind of film that you will probably only want to watch once. You'll want to watch it if you've seen the original (which is a great film in itself) but don't keep your hopes up high as this remake really falls short.
The DVD really has no extras so far from what I can tell except for some trailers on other movies such as "The Howling" and "The Fog". Amazon states that this DVD has "TV spots" on the DVD but I have yet to find them which means that there aren't any TV spots on the disc or they're hidden.
The picture quality isn't all that great though considering this was made for TV I guess I'll let it slide. This is a bare bones disc that only fans of the remake will probably buy. I only bought it because I love the original movie and that this version has never been played in Australia (to my understanding). I'm not sure if it ever would have gotten played here in Australia. I'm kind of disappointed, I was expecting something better.
Check it out. The gym teacher looks like Demi Moore's long lost twin sister, lol.
