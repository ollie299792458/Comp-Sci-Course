How to sum it up in a few words?  Well here's a short attempt:

1)  The sound is amazing.  If you listen to this through a decent system, you will be blown away at the production quality.

2)  I assume you have heard these songs and this group before, so I won't go into detail on the song-writing.  If you don't know this group, then you are in for a treat!

3)  One of the big points of mystery is "who does what?"  Meaning, what things are actually being played versus what things are sequenced or taped.  Well, I don't think this matters much more than a curiosity.  It is them, their songs, and their product.  Sit back and enjoy the show.

4)  Speaking of the show. . . In case you don't know, KW are not known for their dynamic performances, especially lately.  You would never know by listening that Ralf und Florian are in their 60s. . . but, you can certainly tell by the stoic body language.  I don't feel this detracts from the performance in any way.  But, I think it is fair to tell you not to expect a dancefest by them onstage.

That's all for now.  I LOVE both the CD and DVD of this and have watched/listened repeatedly since I bought it.  I recommend it for all lovers of Kraftwerk, and for anyone interested in learning more about them.

Hint: 1st time listener?  I recommend "The Model" "Numbers" and "Computerworld" as well as "Pocket Calculator."  Don't get me wrong, they are all great. . . one of my other favorites is "Elektrocardiogramm."  Ok, enough of my yakking.  Get to it!
