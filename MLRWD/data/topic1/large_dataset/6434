I just don't understand why this Bond movie gets all the bad reviews, it is one of my favorites. 
It may well be that the so-called critics (who in general don't like many of the Bond classics or for that matter many of  the best movies) get to caught up trying to analysis movies.  Movies are  meant as entertainment, period.  They don't always make a social comment or  try to promote someones political ideas.  
A general rule of thumb that I  have learned over the years is to go and see the movies the critics  dislike, first and foremost, as they will generally be the most  entertaining!!
This Bond is action packed and frankly, I always have  liked Moore a little more than Connery in the role...if only by a hairs  difference.
It also comes with the best Bond theme song ever with Paul  McCartney's "Live and Let Die" which is another of his musical  classics.
Don't let the "experts" scare you off of this one..it  does exactly what it is meant to do, entertain the audience....and it does  a supurb job of doing just that!
