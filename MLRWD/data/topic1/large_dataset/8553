I just plain love this as a movie and as masterful traditional animation, but it's also proven to be a Godsend (pun intended) in my work as a religion teacher of inner-city public school students with absolutely no background in the Bible or its characters. Most read far below their grade level; most have never heard of Moses and some have never heard of Egypt, even by 5th grade. Decades ago, old movies on local TV filled in the cultural literacy gap with Hollywood chestnuts like "The Ten Commandments"...now most kids just play video games or watch "American Idol." So...I SHOW THEM THIS MOVIE! They love it...it's thrilling, reverent, and fine for any Christian faith tradition from Catholic to Evangelical, with some lovely touches of Jewish culture thrown in (like haunting Hebrew-sounding chanting)...and our school is fortunate enough to have a DVD player and TV room to show it in. The voice performances are spot-on (catch Ralph Fiennes as haughty Pharoah), and the "FX" for the death of the first-born is as chilling as anything I've ever seen in live action. A few cute funny touches, but no grating "talking animal comic relief" stuff...an underrated classic.
