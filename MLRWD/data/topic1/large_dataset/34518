I had seen this movie before in what I had believed to be the uncut, original version.  I was mistaken.  In the version I saw years ago, there was lots of nudity and a few brief shots of fellatio.  This version has long, drawn-out scenes of pure pornography.  It's not that I mind the sex; Taken on their own, the sex scenes are all beautifully done and, for the most part, fairly erotic (for this kind of thing.)  It's just that none of these scenes are integrated into the rest of the film.  They all come across as utterly gratuitous and ultimately, silly.  Now, if they had just gotten Helen Mirren to disrobe, that would have been a whole other story.
The best part of the movie, in my opinion, is the set design.  There are some elaborate set pieces that are simply outrageous - the moving wall of rotating blades is a sight to behold, as is the giant mock-boat contructed to house Caligula's government brothel.  
The next best part of this movie is scratching your head in wonder at its cast.  Peter O'Toole?!  John Gielgud?!  Helen Mirren?!  How in the name of Captin Crunch did these people end up in this epic porno flick?  This aspect alone makes Caligula a curiosity that should be seen at least once.
