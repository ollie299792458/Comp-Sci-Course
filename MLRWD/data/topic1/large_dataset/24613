The bluray included in this set had such amazing quality - in the beginning when you see a bird's eye view of the scenery it is so crisp and colorful, it made me want to go to  Austria.  It was beautifully restored and impressive to watch. We will use the dvd on road trips in the car.

I don't normally view the bonus material on dvd/blurays, but this time I did. My kids wanted to know about the Von Trapps,  the war and the family and songs - everything.  Some of the bonus menu is different- you get a view of a room in the Von Trapp House (but a graphical representation of it) and can click on different items to learn about different topics. It wasn't exactly straight forward to navigate, but once you clicked on the item, it was fine. I thoroughly enjoyed the background story of the Von Trapps and the restoration of the film.

I'm not sure what it is about this movie, but children always seem to love it. The songs are infectious and my daughters run around the house singing songs from this movie for weeks after watcing it. It was really fun to watch together.
