I have to admit I was pretty sour about Batman Beyond at first. It appeared to be little more than an "updated" version of the legend for the ultra ironic post Spumco WB generation. I have the same apprehensions about the upcoming wearisomely anime "Beware the Batman." But its sympathetic treatment of an aging Bruce Wayne and his rocky succession grew on me after a while. I still don't like Terry's costume, but he's a good if very different Batman all the same. I was willing to overlook the improbability of the Joker downloading himself into a microchip to wreck havoc in the future as the weak plot device it was. It's an entertaining, sometimes funny and often touching film, and I recommend it.

Having said that, I join the universal howl of condemnation that has greeted Warner's clumsy last minute censoring of this movie. I had seen the unedited scenes on YouTube and was anxious to get a legal version and see the whole movie (which is what I assume Warner wants, right?) Imagine my surprise when this mess came along. To say nothing of the dishonesty of it all, the drama, pace and even the blocking was lost. In the climactic Joker Death scene, Tim Drake manages to be in two places at once. I wonder what bureaucratic microbe at Warner decreed this bit of fumbling film sanitizing? And what was gained? In what way is hearing the Joker scream off camera less "scary" to a kid?

Despite this, I recommend this film to anyone who likes the DC Animated Universe, which I have come to vastly prefer to the over the top "let's be edgy because it's cool" regular DC continuity. There's a reason I gave up collecting comics twenty years ago.
