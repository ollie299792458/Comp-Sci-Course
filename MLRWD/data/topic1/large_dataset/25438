I love the idea of these collectives, especially since I already have the first unofficial one (The Jean-Luc Picard Collection). These are a great alternative to buying 28 season box sets at $100 apiece.

One aggravating element about these first three Collectives is that there's a lot of double-dipping forced on the buyer.  ("Double-dipping" is when a DVD buyer has to buy something all over again, like when a special edition is released of a movie you've already bought...or in this case, content is shared between two sets.)

Tthe Voyager episode "Endgame" qualifies as both Borg and Time Travel, and so is in both sets.  Similarly, "All Good Things..." is both a time travel and a Q episode, and is presumably on both sets.  Plus it qualifies as technically two episodes.  And just for good measure, "Hide and Q" is both a Q and a Borg episode.  (The Q content is my guess, since the contents are not posted yet.)

If you buy all three collectives, you'll have duplicates of all those episodes.  How "hand-picked" can they be if no human being recognized the unnecessary duplication and made a decision about putting an episode in one set or the other?  It would have been better if they started out with three concepts that didn't have as much duplication.
