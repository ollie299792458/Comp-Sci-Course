First off, I love Sci-Fi, Time Travel, What-If, Alternate-History etc., movies, but I was bored off of my sofa with this snooze-fest. I was looking forward to watching this movie because I've read so much about it, and somehow never heard of it. I actually heard the 80's song by "Europe" of the same title... the one that goes through my mind every time I say the name of this movie, but never heard of this film until a few months back.

So, if someone can clue me in, as to what exactly I should be so excited about with this picture, I'd appreciate it. The story is very interesting, it's just that the movie didn't really do anything to put me in that period of history once they passed through the "storm" and they were transported back. The acting also was very, ummm, apathetic.

For some strange reason I kept thinking that I was watching a "Made-For-Television-Movie" from  around 1980. Apart from Kirk Douglas, the rest of the cast were television actors. Oh, sorry, then there was Ron O'Neal who was "Superfly" in that 70's blaxploitation film, "Superfly". One of the worst acted movies of all time. (Even though, I still love it.) Martin Sheen....another lousy actor. James Frentino and Katharine Ross are much better than the rest of the cast.

Oh well, I've seen so many movies, I guess I'm entitled to hating a few of them now and then.
