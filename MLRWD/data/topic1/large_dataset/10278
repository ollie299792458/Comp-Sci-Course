As a former academic, I can hardly express how repellent this film was to me. Scholarship is confounded with the spectacle of lying cheats and pretentious [imitations] (literally) digging up dirt, with the avidity and indecency of news reporters chasing a career-making scoop. The script gives almost no sense of the potential value of their find, and Paltrow and Eckhart's characters are so emotionally stunted that they wouldn't know a great love story if they uncovered one. And they don't. The Victorian affair they unearth so diligently is sheer literary melodrama -- the Barretts of Wimpole Street spiced up with Lesbianism and adultery, as phony as Eckhart's perpetual two-day beard.  The major Victorian poet is a droopy-eyed pup. The minor Victorian poetess is irresponsibility personified. When her abandoned female lover takes desperate measures, she blames the male poet and punishes him with breathtaking cruelty. Of course, it's not necessary for characters to be admirable for a film to be. The problem with Possession is that the audience is clearly expected to admire characters who cannot be taken seriously. Of course, it may be that I fled academia because this is how academics truly are, what scholarship has truly become, and what poetry has been reduced to.  In any case, a star each for costumes and cinematography, none for story and characterization.
