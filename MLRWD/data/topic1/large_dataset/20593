So glad I didn't waste money to see this in the theater. I am upset I bought the BR version thinking it would be ok to watch.

The story was all over the place and there were many flaws to be had. I am not talking about flaws in history.  None of us were alive then, so nobody knows what it was like anyway. A few of the special effects were done horribly.  The sabertooth was obviously fake. The golden pyramid tip falling down looked very fake.

Another flaw in the story was the giant birds. The one guy gets attacked and even injured, but when whats his name returns, the guy is still alive.  So everyone is dead and eaten except for him.  So what? His bird got full and gave up?

Did anyone notice how well groomed these "cave men" were.  If you pay very good attention, did anyone notice that the women had shaved legs and arm-pits?  Wow, didn't ever think they would shave those things way back when.  I so hate when the film makers do not pay attention to detail.

I don't know. We watch a lot of movies and usually find the good in even the bad ones. This one has nothing good. We were never so bored in our lives waiting for something to happen. We got the blu-ray version and it really doesn't look all that good compared to other movies.

What a shame. What a good story idea that was made so badly.
