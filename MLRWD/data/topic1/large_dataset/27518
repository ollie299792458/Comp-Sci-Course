This was the first Andrea Arnold film I ever saw and I'm glad I bought it. It's the story that anyone in a dead end situation can relate to. Mia is a lot of teenagers at 15 (lonely,frustrated, depressed) and her environment doesn't help at all. Living with in a housing project with her foul mouthed little sister and young mom (who sees her as competition) is a trying experience to say the least. she does have something going for her... dance(kinda). Mia is real into hip hop culture and wants to become a dancer(see the movie for the result)the films soundtrack go's great with every scene and certain plot points prove that "life's a bitch". This film is so great in that it captures the broken spirit of the characters and you feel like your watching real people deal with real issues. As a American it was refreshing to see another side of London (The ghetto)and that's one of the things I loved about the film.So in closing a round of applause for Andrea Arnold and the cast for a terrific movie and the criterion collection for bringing it stateside. Go see this asap
