'Candyman' is by far the most horrifying movie I have ever seen in my whole life..and I've seen almost every horror movie there is. Not only does this movie make you jump out of your seat, but there is something eerily creepy about it and it made me scared in a way no other movie can. This is not one of those horror movies that you watch for fun or to watch with some friends.It will scare you for days afterwards and you will be scared to go anywhere near a mirror...The things that make this movie so scary are...
1.The setting and atmosphere-It takes place in Cabrini Green, Chicago in the projects.
2.The music-I always say the music makes all the difference in a movie
3.Candyman's voice-He has this very low voice that is just haunting
4.Candyman's hook-It's all bloody and there's something about it that just creeps me out.
The reason I gave this movie 5 stars is because it is the only movie i've ever seen to scare me in the way it did.I would reccomend it only to people who have seen a lot of horror movies.I wouldn't reccomend it to people who are easily scared because i am not but i still was terrified by "Candyman".
