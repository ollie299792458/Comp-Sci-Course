The key to this concert's awesomeness is the presence of Chris Broderick (g) and Shawn Drover (d).

Past live DVDs ("That One Night" and "Rude Awakening") have featured a few "Rust in Peace" live tracks already, but 90's/00's guitarists Al Pitrelli and Glen Drover never managed to capture the magic of Marty Friedman's solos and fills (Glen at least tried, but Al didn't seem to care, or to even understood what a landmark album "Rust" was, judging from his shoddy work on the Rude Awakening live dvd).

And former drummer Jimmy DeGrasso utterly failed to emulate Nick Menza's "lead drums" feel on the Rude dvd, choosing instead to inject some sort of laid-back latin jazz feel into the metal. (Or maybe he just couldn't keep up...)

Things started looking better with last year's "Blood on the Water" video -- a 1-hour HDNet special that introduced many Megadeth fans to Chris Broderick, who is -- FINALLY -- the first guy able to nail Marty's stuff, with aplomb! And Shawn Drover has been matching Nick's strengths for several years now.

So it's a TRUE BLESSING that we will get Chris & Shawn's accurate, powerful playing for this release -- and with Dave Elf back on the bass, this blu-ray is pretty much guaranteed to be the best live show Megadeth have done since the 1990 Rock in Rio show!

I'm actually buying a blu-ray player for this. :)
