I have a little bias here -- this happens to be one of my all time personal favorite movies, so it's easy for me to wax poetic about it.  Basically, the story of an alien who comes to visit, is shot down, temporarily takes human form, is chased by the government, and has to find his way back to meet the other aliens before he runs out of energy and dies.

Sounds like "ET", but this one is for the grownups, not the kids.  What makes it work is a beautiful, sweet romance that develops between the alien and a woman who is initially terrified of him (the alien has cloned himself into the form of her deceased husband).  The writing is minimalist, with breathtakingly pithy, powerful dialog.  Karen Allen gives a beautiful performance, and Jeff Bridges gives one of the greatest performances of any actor in any film ever -- he is simply brilliant as the alien exploring human experience.  This movie is bittersweet, full of hope and romance and redemption, and yet tinged with sadness.  Great date movie, great movie period.
