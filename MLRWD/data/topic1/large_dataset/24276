This movie is a classic and stands on it's own laurels.  If you are reading this review on the blu-ray page, and this is your introduction to the movie, then by golly, get going with it!

The Magnificent Seven is a brilliant re-telling of Kurwosawa's Seven Samuri, told when the 'Western' was a big draw at the box office and movie heroes rode horses and wore wide-brimmed hats.  The characters are portrayed wonderfully by a who's who cast from Hollywood, including Yule Brenner, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Eli Wallach, Charles Bronson and the list goes on.

Having already received a two-disc special edition DVD release, one might question whether or not it's worth double-dipping and bringing The Magnificent Seven on blu-ray into one's personal movie library.  Going almost toe-to-toe with the special edition DVD, as far as bonus features go, the special edition contains an additional commentary track, as well as an additional featurette.

If the bonus content isn't a deciding factor for you, or even if it is, the picture and sound quality of the blu-ray edition of The Magnificent Seven is worth the upgrade.  A beautiful transfer to HD, the colors are vibrant, the picture is clear and the sound is tuned perfectly.

When it comes to transfers of older standards and classics, this edition of The Magnificent Seven is worth every penny.  Not picking it up would certainly be a crime.
