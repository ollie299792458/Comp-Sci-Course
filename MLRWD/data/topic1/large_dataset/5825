I am brand new at yoga and bought this one because it said beginners in the title. Having only practice for only 2 months, I can recognize that is not really for beginners. I have yet to be able to complete the entire DVD. I browsed through the rest and don't plan on ever getting there because the poses all seem to be very similar and boring. She does a demo of the advanced Ashtanga poses and is very impressive but seems to me unrealistic and "out there". I am not looking to be THAT flexible. As for strength, it works pretty well, but it tough to hold some positions. Helping flexability is a 10. I could barely (and I mean barely) touch my ankles but after 2 months, I can easily touch the underneaths of my feet. Also, her voice is insanely monotonous. Even in the interview she does not change tone in her voice. It makes it very hard to relax. She is impressive in what she can do, but if I were tell people (especially beginners), I would only recomend this for people who don't mind alittle bit of boredom and repatition to buy this. If you want diversity, then I do not recomend this DVD.
