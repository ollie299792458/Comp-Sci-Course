Cooper and Schoendsack were filmmakers who had life experience incorporated in their movies.They were adventurers who took personal risks to obtain footage in  "Grass"and "Chang".In "The Most Dangerous Game"they explore man's baser tendencies regarding the hunt and sexual conquest.Embodied in the form of Leslie Banks,the megalomaniacal Zaroff takes sadistic pleasure in stalking human prey.The eerie partial paralysis of the left side of his face(the result of an actual WWI injury)augments the character's dichotomy of culture and malice.

  The story is told economically with an abundance of character development and adventure in 63 minutes.A young Joel McCrea ,the beautiful Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong round out the cast.You will recognize much of the jungle sets as they were utilized in "King Kong".

  The DVD transfer is suberb and up to the usual high quality expected from Criterion.The commentary by film historian Bruce Eder is exemplary.He relates background film material,points out actors and their career highlights,describes technical aspects of the film and provides a fascinating comparison with a scene from "King Kong".
