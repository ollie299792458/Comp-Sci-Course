This movie is so riveting that you will quickly cease being aware that it: (a) was filmed 70 years ago, in 1941, and (b) is in black-and-white.

The movie stays with you long after you watch it.  You think about the characters - what they did, what they said, how they looked - and you discover insights, meanings, and subtleties that you missed when you were watching simply to find out what was going to happen.  You think about the social issues raised:  class struggle, race relations, physical abuse, mental cruelty, the loss of innocence, social injustice, etc.

The acting and directing are superb (OK, "Leo" may have been a little over-acted).

The "back story" to the movie is equally as intriguing as the movie itself.  Apparently, Bette Davis and William Wyler, the director she respected but to whom she wouldn't yield creative authority,  tangled mightily during the production of the film, so much so that they never again worked together.

After you watch the movie, read the play.  The dialogue is terse and vivid.  You find yourself picturing different ways that you would have, or another could have, filmed the movie.  Nevertheless, THIS version is an excellent one well worth the investment of two hours of your time.
