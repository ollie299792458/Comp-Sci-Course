In response to Timothy D. Erenberger "timerenberger" (Iowa, USA) statement ' Well unless you have been living under a rock for the past year or so etc etc ' I must hold my hand up because I have just Crawled out from Under a Rock.

In the UK the Film has not even been released so while Americans can Buy the DVD in a few weeks time if you Search

www.amazon.co.uk you will not find any Information on  Zathura at all.

Although not applicable to  Zathura I have seen British Films filmed in Britain but the DVD version has only been released to America and it can take up to two Years before the Studio allows the ' Rest of The World ' to see it.

The European Union  has a higher  GDP {  Gross domestic product } than America and the EU is ranked First in the World by the World Bank but for some strange reason American Studios still believe that the American market is larger.

In the vain hope that someone will read this please appreciate that the World is a Large Place
