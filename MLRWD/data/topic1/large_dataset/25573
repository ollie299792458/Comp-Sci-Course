One of those "Emperor's New Movies"!  I've never liked G&S musicals, but that wouldn't have mattered if this film told an interesting story.  But the only nice thing I can say is that the sets were absolutely gorgeous.  I spent most of the movie thoroughly confused, frustrated and increasingly angry, because there were so many scenes that made no sense at all. In the opening scene, Sullivan seems to be deathly ill, but we are never told what's the matter with him -- then halfway through the movie he seems to have made a miraculous recovery (no explanation) -- then at the end he seems to be sickly again.  Huh? At one point the producers have a stern discussion with one of the actresses, warning her that "We don't want any more trouble with you this year..." -- and we have no idea what the "trouble" was.  At the Japanese exhibition, Gilbert runs into some people whom he clearly knows, but we're not told WHO these people are (his in-laws) until much later.  And during the scene where the actors are feasting on oysters in a restaurant, what the HELL was that subtitle on the screen telling us that "At this time the Boer War was raging and General XXXX was invading XXX country..."  It had no relevance to anything!  It's as if Mike Leigh made the movie for people who are already experts on G&S's lives and on that period of history!  Or else someone decided to shorten the movie by chopping out earlier scenes that would have given you some history and cleared up all the confusion.  Better to simply remove some of the subplots in their entirety, rather than remove parts of each one.
