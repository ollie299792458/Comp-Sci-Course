This movie is about as entertaining as watching someone else play a video game, and badly.  There is the thinnest of plots, which involves little more than the characters shooting their ways through one situation after another with cool guns.

Stephan Dorff plays Burke, leader of what we are supposed to believe is some sort of elite government fighter squad organized to battle paranormal monsters.  They consist of burly men who look the part, and super-foxy women of color who don't.  They aren't very good at their jobs, either, because killing them is as easy as stepping on ants. Stephen Dorff has one one emotion in this movie, the same one he relies on in every movie:  intense.  He scowls and looks intense.  It's hard to buy because, well, he looks so short.  And he always leads them into a building via the easiest route possible:  They rapel in slow motion through skylight windows.

Tara Reid...well.  She's easy to look at, I guess, but she squeaks her lines, and we're supposed to believe that a woman THAT young has somehow managed to become assistant curator of a large museum.  (IMDB says that Reid's trademark is her deep raspy voice--DEEP?  Well, maybe she cultivated the squeak through voice lessons.) But Burke is impressed enough with her credentials as an anthropologist to let her accompany him (with Slater's character, Carnby) on a mission to Destroy All Monsters, and can't seem to wait to give her high-powered weaponry, which she uses masterfully without any training whatsoever. Yeah, government agents are always that eager to give guns to bimbos. Maybe she was a Navy SEAL before landing the gig at the museum, who knows.

There are no suprises in this movie.  It consists of one  battle after another, with no sense of rising tension or progressive complication.  The characters are interchangeable and two-dimensional, and we never really care what happens to them.

This one's a dead dog.
