This is a really good, heart-warming comedy.  As far as Sandler's movies go, this is the best in my opinion, which is not to say much, since I think he made quite a few mediocre ones.  The story is about a guy (Adam) who falls in love with a girl that, since an accident a year earlier, has not been able to gain any new memories past the current day.  The accident was on her father's birthday, so she thinks everyday of the year is it, making everyone around her put on a show.  A little unbelievable, but the movie does make the story work quite nicely.
In 50 First Dates, the viewer sees a side to Adam Sandler that is not known; he does his usual physical and witty comedy, but he also demonstrates a sensitive side.  Drew Barrymore also is very funny, though her character is by nature a strange one (with no memory beyond a day).  The supporting cast is outstading, especially Rob Schneider, who definitely adds to the comic nature of the movie.  
The story is also a very creative one, with a couple of loose ends but that can be overseen.  For example, Lucy (Drew) is shocked when she first finds out that the life she is living is not real; the next time she finds out, she is a little less shocked, and even less the next time, when we know there should be no diference, since she has no memory of the previous day.
Overall, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes comedy.  It is one of those movies in which you leave the theatre smiling.
