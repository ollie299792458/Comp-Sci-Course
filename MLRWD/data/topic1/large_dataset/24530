This collection from 1986 is a very good introduction to her music - it features singles from her first 5 studio albums. The songs featured on this albums show Kate Bush's ability to be very musically diverse: beautiful slower songs like "The Man With The Child In His Eyes", "Cloudbusting", and the gorgeous "Wow", experimental songs like "Hounds Of Love", "The Dreaming" and "Experiment IV", and big hits like "Running Up That Hill", "Babooshka" and a re-recorded version of her debut, "Wuthering Heights". It's a shame that this album only has 12 tracks (back in 1986 greatest hits albums never had any more, I guess), as some other beautiful singles like "Hammer Horror", "December Will Be Magic Again", "Them Heavy People", "Suspended In Gaffa" and "The Big Sky" didn't make this collection. Maybe EMI should release an "updated" version in 2001, including all her singles, also the ones released since 1986, like "The Sensual World", "Rocket Man" and "Moments Of Pleasure". But still, a great introduction to Kate's music, which is well worth the money!
