I have watched numerous Eric Clapton DVD performance products and have never been dissapointed in a single one. This disc is no exception. The music selection and quality is very good and the interplay between the two classic rock Hall of Famers is electric at times. However, this band although very good is not at the level of EC's previous stage bands. Also even though the video quality was high (almost perfect) on Blu-ray, the camera shots and angle selections are often questionable. Very little is shown of the audience...I know we pay to see the performers but when the crowd is feeling it and really gets into the music some of those shots add to the video experience. Best tracks are definately the blues selections like Double Trouble and Pearly Queen. The Jimi Hendrix tune Little Wing (Layla album) is worth the price of the disc.
Overall I give it a B+. Music A, Sound quality B+, tune selection B, video B+ and camera views C.
If your an EC or Winwood die hard you will not be dissapointed. Younger folks that have an interest in the music of the late 60's & early 70's will learn much from this performance.
