This movie received relatively bad reviews, but I have to wonder why.  Diane Keaton played a mom who WOULD NOT let her daughters grow up and find their own ways in the world.  As I watched the movie at a local theatre, I was tempted to rush the screen and strangle Diane's character for the controlling "witch" she was! But since when should we hold the nature of the role against the actress portraying it? The acting was fine, and the topic was extremely timely for our day.  We live in a world where parents refuse to let their adult "children" go and some "children" refuse to leave home when they reach adulthood (see "Failure to Launch" for the flip side of this crisis)!  The point of this movie (to me) is that parents must realize that their role in life is to prepare their children for adulthood, and that controlling your children's lives past adulthood is ridiculous.

I think this movie makes an important statement, and if it saves even one adult "child" from the clutches of a well-meaning but annoyingly controlling parent, then it has served its purpose!
