How wonderful a place the world would  be if even 10% of men were like Forrest Gump - amazingly simple, astoundingly perfect and alarmingly good.
Love and committment have such universal chord that it brings in tears spontaneously when two people destined for each other, eventually get married too. I had not read the novel before watching the movie; it felt so good to see Jenny finally deciding to marry Forrest.. it seems almost a perfect reward for Forrest's life time contributions of being a good man.
The best part of the movie is that it does make one shed at least one undesirable trait of one's persona, rather uassumingly. The power of love and humanism, and the demands it makes on one's emotions, is indeed the only reason for every human being to be born and stay alive.
Tom Hanks is brilliant and uarguably the best actor around in our times. 
PS : If the movie evokes nostalgia and longingness for your childhood sweetheart from neighbourhood of long past, as against marriages of urban convenience, remember to thank Jenny !
