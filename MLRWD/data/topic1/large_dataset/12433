this motion picture was made in the early sixties at a time when revolutionary changes were threating the calm peacful american scene and society. his view in this picture was that riots, demonstations loss of tranquility that we took for granted was soon to be ripped apart. the birds represent all of those social changes that were soon to tear up the fabric of american society.the attack of the birds was upon a peaceful normal small slice of ammericana.this indicated that no place was to be safe from the trumatizing effects of drugs, bizzare behavior, riots,crime,generation gap and all the other effects which were to destroy all that was held to be sacred. schools were attacked.childrens birthday partys were no longer safe.could the birds be held to represent all that was to soon render our society a fearful place to live in. even bodega bay? has anyone ever considered this point of view? if i am correct then this was the one and only prophetic and most horrifying of hitchcock`s  motion pictures. I loved and hated it for that reason.
