usually the ppv after wrestlemania is an awesome ppv....last years backlash was awesome!!!! but this years was very very average and the wff usually doesn't make average ppvs.here is my review for the ppv with 5 starz bein the best.
Match 1: X Factor vs. The Dudleyz - nobody really cared about this match. basically a bad match with nothin special but tables at the end like usual.. but a good finish a double superkick called X Marks The Spot. RATING: *1/2
Match 2: Hardcore Champion Rhyno vs. Raven - awesome match here...the best Hardcore Title Match since the title started.....Raven and Rhyno rules!!!!! ECW 4-ever RATING: ****
Match 3: William Regal vs. Chris Jerichio - good match here but it could have done without the screwjobs by the nasty queen on the outside. RATING: ***1/2
Match 4: Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle in a Ironman submission match - this was a boring 30 min for me.......I dont know why they couldnt just have a regular iron match.......this was just very disapointing. RATING: **
Match 5: The Big Show vs. Shane McMahon - bad match but Shane is the new Mick Foley as a bumptaker and boy he proved it here. RATING: ***1/4
Match 6: European Champion Matt Hardy vs. Christian vs. Eddy Guerrero - all 3 of these wrestlers are talented and I really loved this match!!!!!!! I dont know why but its awesome!!!!!! good one here RATING: ***1/2
Match 7: World Champion Steve Austin & I-C Champion HHH vs. Tag Team Champions Kane & Taker - horrible match and every knew what the ending was gonna be so dont waster your time RATING: *1/3
bOTTOM lINE: BAD PPV AND VERY UNDER PAR FOR WWF PPVS
