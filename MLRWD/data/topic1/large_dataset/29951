This is one of the most visually stunning hong kong cinema pieces. The action is top notch, and the story was great. The interesting thing about this film is how the plot unfolds from different interpretations or vignettes in the movie. Jet Li is excellent throughout. Ignore the "QUentin Tarentino" title over it, all he did was pay for the film to get over to the usa- He didnt have anything to do with the making of this magnificent film. It's rather annoying that he has to slap his name over it. Yet any unknowing moron will think he made this film. He did the same thing on HOSTEL He had his name all over the title as if he made the movie, when he was just the producer. That's akin as if the recent TITANIC film had "Rae Sanchini" name over the title!!! He didnt do anything with directing it.  All quentin=shameless name dropper tarentino aside, Hero is a MUST OWN if you are into hong Kong cinema and these types of movies.

Not to mention, if you own a Huge screen tv, the movie alone is worth demoing to your friends. The cinematography is jaw dropping. Buy it!
