"King Kong vs. Godzilla" is the 3rd installment of the Godzilla series, and the first Godzilla film to be shown in color. The film was produced 7 years after "Gojira No Gyakushu" and it is immediately clear that Toho has become rusty on how to make excellent Godzilla films. The elements of a classic such as compelling storyline, good kaiju opponent, and several moments of high drama are all present. The problem with this film is execution. The effects are subpar for the series, which really pulls the viewer out of the movie. Worse still the progression of the storyline seems choppy at best. This jarring progression of events in "King Kong vs. Godzilla" really irritates me, because the concept of an intelligent animal like King Kong squaring off against the brute force of Godzilla is very appealing. I suspect some of these problems are due to editing of this film for American audiences, so I may revise this movie review when I see the Japanese version. The US version is 7 minutes shorter than the Japanese version, and the American version has 10-15 minutes of scenes in English only. No doubt these scenes provided at least some of the continuity lacking from the US version Taken as it is, "King Kong vs. Godzilla" is a fair but uneven Godzilla film that leaves me wanting for more.
