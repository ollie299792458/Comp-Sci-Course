This film deserves a 5-star rating, and then some. 
Although I find most teen movies to be crude, obscene, obnoxious, or some variation of those three terms, this one proves itself entirely different, and a hundred times better. Not only does it prove that teen movies CAN be worth a watch no matter how old you are, it also proves that they can be even better than more 'mature' films in the romance genre. 
A Walk to Remember is a story about your typical high school romance blossoming between two completely different people... or is it? Not quite. It's better than typical. The female lead is a talented do-gooder daughter of a Church man.... and her male love interest just happens to be the resident school bad boy who hangs out with the type of people who bully and make fun anyone who doesn't fit in with the crowd. Together they learn what it means to be true to themselves and to those they care about, and what it means to fall in love. 
This touched me in a way that films rarely ever do. I only wish it had come out during my high school years. I truly think that anyone with a soft spot for romance will fall in love with this movie as much as I have, no matter what their age may be... but it's even better if you're a high school girl, searching not only for love, but for a place to belong. Watch it with someone you care about. If the guys aren't nauseated by all the romance (dump him!), then he'll be crying along with you for a good third of the movie. It's absolutely beautiful.
