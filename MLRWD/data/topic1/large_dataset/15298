This hauntingly beautiful film asks something of its audience.  Don't expect high action, and don't look for constant explainations of what you see.  Active contemplation is what I expect Spielberg wanted from his audience with this outing.  Several reviewers on this page remark that the third act of this film is overwrought, even hokey.  For those of us who pay attention and understand that the "aliens" (which assimilate David's memories) at the end of this film are not aliens at all, but self-evolving mecha which have discovered a missing link to their original creators (i.e.: humans), then we are rewarded with one of the brightest speculative fiction films in many years.  To paraphrase Gigolo Joe: "Humans hate us because when they're gone, we will be all that's left."  This search for the creator is ultimately a very human endeavor.  I found that my fondness of this quiet bit of specualtion grew exponentially with multiple viewings (at first, I also thought those mecha were aliens--which cheapened the film a bit--once I came to the realization, it was as if I had seen an entirely different film).  A highly Kubrickian film, despite what many of his so-called "die-hard" fans might think.
