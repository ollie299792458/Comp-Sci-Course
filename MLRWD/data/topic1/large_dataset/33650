"Killers" is a watchable film, plain and simple. It has beautiful locations, hot stars, shiny cinematography and nicely handled action. Sure, the plot is dumb, leaves some to be desired and is a rehash of films like "True Lies" and "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" (and certainly not unlike the other action romantic comedies of 2010 "Date Night", "Knight and Day" and "The Bounty Hunter"), but it's done with such a tongue and cheek manor that the silly plot goes down easy enough. Director Robert Luketic does a fine job of handling his stars, Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl (who give it their all, and at times it is transparent, but overall, they make a cute team) and the balance of comedy and action. The action works better than the comedy, thankfully, but it still adds that wink wink, nudge nudge the picture needs to thrive. Something I was not expecting was 1) the overly stylish nature of the film; which adds greatly to the final outcome and 2) that Kutcher and Heigl are convincing enough to make you feel like their characters might resemble what real people might do in this insane situation (something that was missing from the horrible "The Back-Up Plan"). Overall, "Killers" is nothing special, but as for a minor diversion into action, comedy and romance it's not terrible. For more satisfying films you should definitely see "True Lies" and "Mr. & Mrs. Smith", but in the meantime, "Killers" will work just fine.
