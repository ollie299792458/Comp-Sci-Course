I've seen a good share of the Classic Albums series by now that I was expecting some real deep insight into the making of this classic album. But I think I know why that is with this edition and its probably because Kurt is no longer with us. I mean Krist even says this on the dvd that Kurt was the creative force behind the band. So how deep can you get when the source of that depth is dead. All it seemed like was them reflecting on how the album effected the band and the music landscape which by now has all been said before. One thing I couldn't help but notice is that they have deleted scenes and those cuts actually had the depth that I was looking for with some of them. But the fact that they have very useful deleted scenes for something (I'm pretty sure) that's only a DVD series puzzles me because what's the need for cutting them? I was looking for the making of the album not more or less a reflection of the album cause they're everywhere these days. Not to say this isn't a good watch, it's not up to par with the others in the Classic Album series. All the other ones I've seen (Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, The Doors' first album, Queen's A Night at the Opera, U2's Joshua Tree and even the unofficial first of the series The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band which is on YouTube) I would rate 5 outta 5 because they were just so much more insightful to how albums are made and the stories behind iconic songs, so that's why I give Nevermind a 4 outta 5.
