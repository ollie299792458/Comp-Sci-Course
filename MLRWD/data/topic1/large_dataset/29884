While neither of these movies compare to classics such as "Total Recall" or "Terminator 2: Judgement Day," they are still solid action films.

"Eraser" features Arnold as a CIA agent who has the job of erasing witnesses backgrounds in order to protect them.  When Vanessa Williams is targeted by the villians, he must protect her in order to save the country.  This is a good film with some great action scenes.  This also features some of Arnold's better acting.

"Collateral Damage" is another entertaining film.  Arnold stars as a fireman who goes to Columbia seeking revenge.  The film was originally planned for an October 2001 release.  However, the theme of terrorism took a different tone after September 11, 2001.  Wisely the film was postponed for a while.  I found Arnold's acting to be a little off in this film, especially toward the beginning where he has to communicate grief and loss. Once he gets to Columbia, the film picks up quite a bit and is a very good action film.

The DVD set is a flipper.  "Collateral Damage" has a nice collection of special features.  Both films are presented in widescreen.

When I originally saw "Eraser", I felt that maybe it was time for Arnold to retire (I like it more now than I did then).  He continued to star in films, but the returns at the box office were diminishing.  "Collateral Damage" faired poorly at the box office, although I think that had as much to do with bad timing than a loss of interest in Arnold's films.  However, in the latter, the Austrian Oak seems a little tired of the whole genre.  After the success of "Terminator 3" he would run for governor.  With his term coming to a close, perhaps he will return to making movies.
