As an avid Moto kinda guy i was so happy when i saw the trailer of this movie somewhat decent cast good lookin few bikes. Than i watch the whole thing the other day ,ok i get it tribute to 60`s biker movie except it is not!! it is just trying very hard to be something i dont know what  .The acting ,well just plain sad the plot who cares after the third flashback the characters so weak and not dangerous that it is laugfable i mean i`ve known and seen hardcore and  1% bikers i can a sure you that (in the movie) they are not,  i am sure outlaw guys are laughing about this movie. I mean r you telling me that the lead guy looks hard, no way and i am almost sure Madsen knows the real deal guys himself.
The girls are so hot & soulless that you know real bikers dont know chicks like that in real life . I  guess i can go on dogging this movie  forever. Shame that they spend time and energy on this project . i know i know it is only a movie but when one knows a bit about the subject you would want to see something better ,better writing more interesting characters i could go on  but not Tarantino kind a senseless blood bath  Man!!!!!  when is anyone gonna make a decent biker movie .
  Still good job on my friend Justin pulling all this bikes including  not period perfect  Exile bike of V. Jones
