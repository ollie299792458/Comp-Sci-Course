As Carolyn reviewed, I also read the book first, absolutely loved it, and was delighted to find the movie. As she wrote:

"The movie was absolutely beautiful. The set, the costumes, the outdoor shots - everything was a pleasure to watch. One disappointment (and I believe a major character development issue)is that in the book Tilo is 'incarnated' as an aged woman. The young man is attracted to her none the less, and part of the temptation of the spices is for her to use them to make herself young and beautiful for him so that he will be physically attracted as well. In the movie, Tilo is already young and gorgeous, and the guy is so head over heels that there is no tension in that regard."

I would love to have seen this aspect played in the movie as the book was written, as so much else followed the book. I think the producers were afraid that people wouldn't want to see the older, ugly woman. But part of the beauty is what the characters see through, and what she has to endure looking like that, with her devotion to the spices.
