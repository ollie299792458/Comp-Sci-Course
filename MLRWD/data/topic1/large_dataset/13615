This started out as what I thought was going to be a clever and entertaining movie with an interesting plot. But after the point where Mark tells a lie, the movie just disintegrates. * SPOILER ALERT* He tells a lie to further his own personal interests, understandably, but I thought that Bad Karma would get him for it. Well, he goes through some difficulties, but in the end he wins. So I guess the moral of this stupid story is that it's OK to lie, even if you do it for personal gain.

The only part of the plot that is good is that Mark wins over Anna because he truly loves her, unlike how hotshot Brad Kessler feels about her. That's fine and dandy, but that has nothing to do with lying. So basically, the whole premise of everybody always telling the truth and never lying is useless..there is no connection between that and the love triangle of those three, other than the fact that Mark is rich from telling a lie. But Kessler is probably fairly wealthy, too, so dumping Kessler for Mark doesn't seem to have much to do with money.

I know, it's just a comedy (so-called) movie, nothing to get too serious about, but I thought the storyline was weak and disconnected.
