Since I am making an assumption that you have already seen the movie if you are going to purchase the DVD, I will only present a summary of the work itself, and focus the review more on the DVD edition.

Before the glut of formulated sports movies, before they became so predictable, the remarkable movie "Hoosiers" premiered in 1986.Without question, this family friendly story of hope and redemption proved that a movie can have a happy ending and still contain a good story enshrouded in talent.

For fans of the movie like me, the 20th anniversary DVD was a great buy. The DVD contains outtakes that tie loose pieces of the movie together, such as the strange number of players in the film, the volatility of Coach Dale is fully explored in the outtakes. There is a director's cut, which, among many other things, explains that the movie was filemd on a low budget with not so many perfect autumn days, etc...There is also full length footage of the actual team the story is based on, as well as a description of the real story of the team. It comes in a two disc set. I highly recommend buying it.
