The secretary is simply splendid and refreshing. I am glad to see a film that is unconventional, yet still has traces of a romantic comedy.  Lee (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a cutter. She gives herself pain and in return gets pleasure from it. In the beginning of the film Lee gets out of the hospital and looks for a job. He starts working for a lawyer, Mr. Grey (James Spader). Mr. Grey himself has psychological issues having to do with control. Initially the relationship they have is sort of shocking, but you soon realize that it may actually be healthy. The issues that they have sort of come together to fit in a yin yang. They begin to complement each other.  Lee was a good role for Maggie Gyllenhaal. I think she did very well. I always enjoy watching James Spader's performances. He can act sophisticated and professional, yet crude and mean at the same time. He was also perfect in the movie Pretty and Pink. I recommend this film for the open minded. It is not a typical romance film. What I thought was so genuine to the characters was that it wasn't just the act of sex and affection that brought the lovers together, but a specific quality that brought Lee and Mr. Grey together.
