Hollywood sure has a knack for building up great possibilities and then knocking them down with weak delivery.  David Mamet has skills, don't get me wrong.  State and Main was very entertaining.  And the acting in the Heist is quite convincing. So the blame rests squarely on Mamet's head. He tries so hard to twist and trick you, usually unsuccessfully, that you end up being annoyed every time the truth is revealed.  Sadly, the devices that Mamet uses that could have elevated this film to true excellence fail miserably.  The quirky lines are delivered like 'One Night at the Roxbury' pick up lines; the heist itself has holes you could fly a Swiss jet through; and the pacing of the scenes where someone is getting conned are painfully laborious.  Finally, the big switcheroo ending made me actually say 'puh-leeez' outloud.  Perhaps if the any of the seven (!) producers actually watched this film all the way through, they would have realized that it needed a lot of trimming.  This is a somewhat entertaining film that could have been great.  Kudos to Theodore Shapiro for an excellent film score.  I am looking forward to all of the movie reviewers that will make some sort of 'heist' pun.  Perhaps 'Steal this movie.....'
