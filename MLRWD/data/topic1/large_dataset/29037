Hitchcock considered "The 39 Steps" to be the culmination of his work in Britain, just as "North by Northwest" was a culmination of his work in America.  The movie is well-paced, Robert Donat is charming, and Madeleine Carroll is beautiful.  The commentary by Marian Keane is very insightful as she points out Hitchcock's "signatures" as the author of his films.  Why did he choose a high angle shot?  Why are the characters composed the way they are?  Why does the camera dwell where it does?  This is the first commentary I have heard from Keane, and I was not disappointed.
The Criterion Collection transfer is a little grainy, and the intensity is a little inconsistent.  Criterion's transfer of Hitchcock's "Rebecca" is far more flawless.  Nevertheless, it is comparable to other transfers they have done of movies from that period (i.e., a little less grainy than "Trouble in Paradise").  Overall, an excellent purchase, and one I would recommend for anyone who liked "North by Northwest" or who is interested in seeing how Hitchcock developed as a filmmaker.
