Michael Wood is a very vibrant host who truly understands and loves India. The documentary gives excellent insight into both ancient and modern Indian culture. The footage of the villages and cities is just amazing to say the least. The documentary speaks about everything from the life of the Buddha, to the modern day Indian rebellion against the British.

Now for the cons. The information is sometimes put forth in a way that if one was not already slightly familiar with Indian history, they could began to lose track of what's going on for a bit. Also I was extremely disappointed that the almost 2000 year old Christian communities in India were not mentioned - except for a vague reference to a certain port in India that the Apostle Thomas is believed to have arrived at. Christians make up 2.3% of India's population, whereas Sikhs for example make up 1.9% of it. Anyway, other than those two issues, the DVD is excellent, and well worth watching, and perhaps re-watching a few more times for fun!
