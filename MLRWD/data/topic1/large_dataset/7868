There is a real resonance to this film that I have seen in few John Wayne movies.  The Duke is still very manly in this film, but most of the macho is gone.  I found myself really getting into Wayne's character, and watching with genuine interest what will happen with his relatonship with Lauren Bacall(still looking great) and Ron Howard.  The Duke didn't seem to be playing a cariacature of himself but something much more real-it doesn't surprise me that he was dealing with real life and death issues in his own life when the film was made.  I kept thinking to myself-"you know, the Duke is really acting in this one!"  Also, the fact that the town was changing to more modern ways in the film is analogous to the fact that Westerns were mostly out of vogue when this picture was made-I think the filmmakers were making their own commentary about that in this movie.  It probably would have been considered too sentimental to give John Wayne an Oscar for "The Shootist," but it would have made perfect sense-his acting is really deserving of an award in his final performance.
