If you are interested in the Frost/Nixon interviews, you are better off watching the real thing.  This movie invents entire conversations and events that never happened.  I think it is because liberals like Ron Howard aren't satisfied with the actual historical record. It simply is not critical enough of their political adversaries.  So, like any good propagandist, Howard just makes stuff up and tries to pass it off as actual history, similar to Oliver Stone and Michael Moore.  The climactic "phone call" scene in this movie is completely made up.  It was not some minor dramatic plot device either, the entire arc of the story pivots at that point.

There is a character monologue towards the end of the movie attributed to James Reston.  The irony is that he is lamenting the fact that television sometimes does not properly convey the "truth", but he goes on to say the Frost/Nixon interviews somehow succeeded in doing that.  Interesting this would be in a film which completely demolishes the historical truth of the event it is chronicling. It was nice to see the film failed financially as most people weren't drawn into this pointless exercise.
