I agree with many of the comments by previous reviewers.  The film is something of a museum piece, but continues to fascinate largely due to its strange, painted sets and other visual elements.  Those interested in this film, either as an important work of German cinema, or as a curiousity, may like to know the rest of Caligari's story...
The original screenwriters wrote a story of an insane doctor controlling a sleepwalker and using him to do his evil bidding. This could be considered a warning to the Germans not to "sleepwalk" into the control of an evil Caligari-like dictator. But then, the film was turned over to another German filmmaker who added a "framing story" that places the story of mad Caligari as a fantasy in the head of a patient in an asylum.  Intentional or not, this frame reverses the meaning of the film.  Instead of a warning against following authoritarian leaders blindly, the finished film positions Caligari as a compassionate doctor who can cure the patient now that the meaning of his insanity has been revealed.
A curious bit of film trivia, given where the world was heading.
