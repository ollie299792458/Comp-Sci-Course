Reading the synopsis, I didn't really know what to expect...going into the movie.

But what I found, was quite a wild ride, but simplistic in nature. And honestly the one question that plagues my mind after watching this.. What did Bronson want? Was it really to gain simple fame? To leave a mark on society as a whole? Because hey a movie was made after him, he has some books out, and is still apparently by this film, in prison. But we all now know of him. At least a good chunk of people.

I mean, the only thing he does through out the whole film, is beat people up. Locations change... But all he seems to do, is just beat up prison guards, and get beat up. What's he after? To find that breaking point of his? And later on in the film, the dude gets buck naked. yes, and has a guard rub .. some paste onto him? Its white. And then at a later point, he gets covered in black paint. Which maybe has some sort of...symbolic meaning? The reason I bring this up, hopefully someone will read my review and give me a heads up, is because he is on stage as well several times through out the movie, talking to the audience. I figure the two are connected.

And if he liked beating people up so much, why didn't he just get into boxing? At least then he'd been facing people that were his equal match and earning money.

One thing I want to mention is the movie isn't your standard fare. It doesn't really have a ending. It just stops. And its an oddball movie in its pacing. (Maybe their was a lot that was cut?) It seems like it should have been a little longer.
