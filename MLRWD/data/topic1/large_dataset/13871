Taking a peek at the reviews of "Dread" was certainly a mixed bag of tricks.  It was picked and panned in equal measure.  Entering the world of "Dread" with an open mind will yield a film that is at once interesting and horrifying in the end result.  It contains a more than fair portion of gore effects, heart felt acting from mostly unknown actors, a slightly changed storyline from the short story by Clive Barker, and high end psychological horror.

Those who panned the film probably were expecting "Hellraiser" or something of that caliber.  Perhaps "A" list horror was the expectation and low budget was the disappointing result. Dread does not have the startling moments that is standard fair for horror films.  It does not have a loud booming sound while a creature jumps into the face of the audience.  What sets this film apart from others is the scripting.  The story's suggestion that everyone has certain fears and may benefit from trying to face them is somewhat unique, and the actors certainly do a good job of fleshing out that which, in the end, is very unpleasant and disturbing.

Being that the goal of horror is to create discomfort in the viewer, or reader, "Dread" succeeds on all counts.  It is not "Friday the Thirteenth" or "Halloween."  It is a think firm, thus the pacing will have a slow build up to allow the viewers to buy in to each carnivorous concept.  Thus, this Clive Barker story adaptation does rate among one of the best.
