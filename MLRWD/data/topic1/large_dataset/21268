I saw the previews for this movie and thought it would be really good.  Well, I was wrong.  Before you get half way through, you'll have already figured out what's going on.  If you haven't, don't worry, since they pretty much give it away before even half the movie has ended.  There are no scary parts of the movie.  Sarah sounds like she is laughing, when she is supposed to be sobbing and/or hysterical, and there is absolutely 0 plot development at all.  Then, the movie just ends, and leaves you saying "WTF?".  The Silent part of the title came from the audience's reaction in the theater when the movie was over.  Unfortunately for me, I paid the purchase price on Amazon Instant Video, rather than renting it first.  Well, that's one movie that will forever sit in my digital library without ever being watched again.  If you're looking for a horror movie, or even a psychologically intense movie, I suggest passing on this one.  If your curiosity is so strong that you have to see it for yourself, wait for it to be in Redbox for $1.99 (or rent it on Amazon Instant Video for that price), rather than buying the digital version or a DVD/Blu-ray version.  I rarely dislike a movie (and I've watched many of them), but I just couldn't find anything good to say about this one, other than that 15-year-old boys will enjoy the excessive focus on Sarah's cleavage throughout a majority of the movie.
