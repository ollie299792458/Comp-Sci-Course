Anchorman is one of Will Farrell's best movies out yet. Set in San Diego during the 1970s, TV anchorman Ron Burgandy is the town's leading man as top player of the area's top rated news show. Loved by women and idolized by men, Ron has the fast track to a network anchor position all to himself, until the station brings in a female newscaster.

Now that the gender barrier has been broken, Ron is torn between his growing feelings for the new girl and the professional rivalry the two share at work.

With the competition breathing down his back, Ron must make all the right moves to secure the gig and keep the girl.
