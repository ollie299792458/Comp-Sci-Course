Irving Berlin's "Easter Parade," starring Judy Garland and Fred Astaire is about as good as vintage Hollywood musicals get.  Produced in 1948 by M-G-M's top musical producer, Arthur Freed, "Easter Parade" is a tuneful romp that features stellar performances by its stars, and a top-flight Irving Berlin score.  Musical standards include "A Couple Of Swells," "Steppin' Out With My Baby," "Shakin' The Blues Away," and the title song.  This film is currently available on DVD - but only on a pricey 3-DVD set paying deserving tribute to Judy Garland.  The film co-stars Anne Miller and Peter Lawford in appropriately .... charming (respectively) support.  Its plot is simple: Astaire is a Broadway hoofer whose partner (Miller) has left him for a spot in The Ziegfeld Follies.  Garland is the singer (no great dancer is she, at the start) who is summarily hired by Astaire as Miller's replacement.  A love triangle (and much musical-comedy bliss) ensues, and great fun is to be had by anyone watching this great vintage movie musical.  Astaire is marvelous here, and Judy (if you loved her as the teenaged Dorothy in "The Wizard Of Oz," and who didn't?) is sublime as always.  Buy it, rent it, steal it if you have to.  "Easter Parade" is not to be missed.
