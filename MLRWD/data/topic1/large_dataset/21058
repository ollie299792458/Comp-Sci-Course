Hollywood slasher movies are not all 'cut-out' to be the same! This one had great special effects. I for one, didn't mind seeing Paris Hilton get hers! She did prove to me that she MIGHT be able to do SOME acting - with a little work! But, alas the movie wasn't really about her! It was about a group of teenagers who get lost (hmmm?) and happen upon a small town in the middle of nowhere who's residents are all made of wax. One by one, they all go missing; and soon turn up as part of the exibit!

The artist had started out in his earlier life working the family 'taxidermy' business, but he just couldn't get the eyes just right. They weren't quite 'lifelike'. We all know that 'practice makes perfect' so our main character must work at his trade, trying some 'new techniques'. Indeed he takes pride in work, in fact he surrounds himself in it! I don't want to give it all way, so you gotta see for yourself. It's raunchy, clever, sexy, fun and oh . . . GROSS! All of the best stuff one needs to enjoy a cold winter eve, curled up with someone they love! Enjoy!
