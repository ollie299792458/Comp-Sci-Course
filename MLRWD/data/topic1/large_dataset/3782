This movie has all the qualities of the classic comedy movies like Animal house, Bachleors party, Porkys, Caddyshack, Van Wilder, and all Bill Murray movies. Well maybe the last part was a little bit out there. But if you liked the raunchy type of comedy with gross out laughs and clever quick one liners, then this movie is for you. This is defintly the new generations animal house, considering the rising climate of video games in the younger generations, this movie just fit perfectly. It's a shame this movie did horrible in theatres but it did develop a cult following once released on DVD. The pacing of the movie is steady and fast, never getting boring. But it does lag in the last 15-20 mins of the movie. I felt they didnt know how to end this properly but just threw together this ending anyways. I maybe harsh towards the ending but I laughed so hard the whole way through and the last mins of the movie seemed to lose its touch. Overall its defintly worth a rental for a get together with friends. I'm no critic but I know funny and this is defintly one funny movie.
