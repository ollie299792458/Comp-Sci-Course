The content of this edition is better than one would expect from a 1970's series.  I have not recieved it yet, but according to the box, it only has commentaries on the original three episode pilot.  One wishes that there were more commentaries.  Another plus is that every episode is in stereo.  Even the original release of the pilot, (in the form of the theatrical feature film), was in mono, so that's a nice plus.
My only real beef, (and it's a big one) is the completely unnecessary large boxing of this edition, (with the glowing eye Cylon mask).  I feel that this collection would sell itself without this bulky extra, which would also bring down the rather high price tag for this series.  As others will, I'll wait to get it at a lower price.
As many others have stated, I, as well, grew up during the 70's and as a kid thoroughly enjoyed tuning into this show, so it definitely has a large camp value.  I also agree with other reviewers in that, dont look for deep, vast cosmic storylines.
Even Star Trek was commonly derivative, (that'll cheese off some trekkies), so, enjoy this for it's simple entertainment value.
On a last note, does the new Battlestar Galactica have Starbuck and Apollo as women?!  (*&amp;#@!!!)
