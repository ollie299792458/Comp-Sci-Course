Some people may have gone to this movie expecting to see an action triller with Jennifer Lopez kicking butt as a Chicago police officer (there is some of that), and then they were disappointed to find out that there are some scenes where Jennifer's character actually cries and (God forbid!) has feelings.  These people may have walked away disappointed.  I saw 'Angel Eyes' for pretty much the same reason but I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I met some characters who had depth to them, and were dealing with real conflicts.
I have to admit I didn't think a lot about Jennifer's talents as an actress before 'Angel Eyes', but now I am convinced that the girl has some real screen talent.
The writer apparently comes from a TV background and TV movies tend to be more personal than Hollywood movies, and that shows through to this movie's benefit.
This movie was released in Europe when I was living in Paris, and I didn't see it there, though I wish I had, since it would have made me happy to see a well-made American film along side Parisians who have been known to be critical of Hollywood.  This is an example of one of those rare gems that Hollywood emits from time to time to keep us interested.
