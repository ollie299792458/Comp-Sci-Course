This is maybe worth a rental or if you can find a cheap used version.  I enjoy Jackie Chan so I'll watch anything he's in.  But this one was difficult.

The dialogue is bad and it's made SO much worse by all the crappy dubbing!  There is very little Cantonese so it would have been fine to give us subtitles.  Most of the film is in English.  The incredibly annoying problem is Anthony Wong's voice actually changes in the film!  It's him when he speaks to the English speakers (he can speak English fine) but they dubbed him when he's speaking to the Cantonese actors.  Great...two voices?!?!  It's so obvious in some scenes as he goes from English to Cantonese and back again that it's annoying.

Don't spend too much money on this flop, but if you're a JC fan it's hard not to see all his films.  Skip Medallion until you've seen the rest.  Surprisingly there are some good co-stars here, which is why I give this two stars instead of one.  Medallion might be be tied with Tuxedo as the worst JC film, just because of all the guest stars.  Otherwise Tuxedo is a bit better since it's a solid two star film.
