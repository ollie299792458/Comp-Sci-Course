This is the most beautiful film I have ever seen on DVD. I have the earlier VHS version and the difference is unbelievable. The color on DVD is magnificent and having the DVD option of Dolby sound makes the score sound incredible. In its entirety, the film colors are rich and true. Omar Sharif's robes are totally black not grey and Peter O'toole's white robes are breathtaking. Omars eyes are rich and liquid brown, the skies are blue with white clouds, and the camels harnesses are beautiful bright and multicolored. The desert sands are tan colored, light brown and all hues in between, shifting ever so slightly from scene to scene. And the acting is beyond any I have seen in many many years. Peter O'toole should have an Oscar on his mantle because he made T.E. Lawrence a reality for me, so much so that since buying this DVD, I have bought and am reading T.E. Lawrence's book about his campaign in the desert "Seven Pillars of Wisdom." A five star event made unforgettable on DVD forever.
