Wonderfully creative and a fabulous great time to watch - best of the three Ice Age flicks.  I loved how the animators created the sense of size and weight of the Dino's.  This movie is definitely worthy of being the summer box office smash hit that it was, grossing 878.5 million worldwide.  Pixar, Disney, and Dreamworks can only "wish" they could produce a "cash-cow" like this movie for under 90 million.  I love some of the computer animated movies from those companies, as well.

I saw Ice Age 3 for the first time when it came out on DVD.  I loved it. The movie had a very strong story but well-tempered by the comedy relief of Scrat, Scratte, & the Acorn. Speaking of the Scrat & Scratte scenes, this movie revived my interest in the classic song "You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine," by Lou Rawls, which was used as a romantic backdrop in those scenes.  It is a beautiful song.  I remember seeing Lou Rawls sing it on TV when I was a kid.

After renting this movie to see it for the first time, I purchased my own DVD copy on Amazon.
