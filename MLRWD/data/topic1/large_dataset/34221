The latest release of "Re-animator" does actually contain elements of previous releases, stemming back to its initial laser-disc, extra-laden presentation in the 1990s.

What is fetching in this latest release is a very comprehensive documentary, which subtly conveys Stuart Gordon's expertise as a director. Additionally, the transfer looks grander (and gorier) than ever before, and the unqiue packaging should be enticing to any horror-movie collector.

Indeed, if one has never purchased "Re-animator" before on DVD (or VHS/Laser Disc), this edition will prove quite mind-blowing. For those who have purchased the movie before (or who have simply viewed it many times over in the past), there is still enough new fringe offerings to make this entry a glorious catch, especially if one can obtain the highlighter/syringe collectible as part of the packaging.

"Re-animator" is an indisputable classic, and this particular special-edition is the ultimate to possess to date.
