Haven't we all wondered what it would be like if suddenly one day our favorite actor or actress found their way in our lives and if, hope beyond all hope, they actually fell in love with us?  
Don't say no.  You know  you have.  
The general originality and relitivity of this film hit the  bullseye.  Grant is great to watch and plays the comic, yet sweet role to  perfection.  And, of course, Roberts is the real deal when it comes to big  name actresses today.  They play well off one another and the viewer is  concerned about their relationship even before they are.  
On the other  hand, a deeper look at this movie reveals a plot that keeps trying to play  the same notes to get different tunes.  They're together, they break up,  they're together, they break up before you know it again.  Basically, it  tries to get too many miles out of too few changes in the relationship.  But that's a deeper look...
Back on the surface, this movie is really fun  and funny.  Grant, it's worth mentioning again, is super.  Roberts shines,  particularly in the down moments between the two and Spike--well, of  course, Spike is great.
