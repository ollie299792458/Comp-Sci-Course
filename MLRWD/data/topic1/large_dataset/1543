this is a brilliant production in every way, and impossible to fault. there are many excellent reviews of this already, so i only want to add my voice to the chorus of praise. to be sure, daniele de niese is a shining star - her performance is infused with a delightful, palpable charm and sexuality (and she's so hot!) - but that's not to detract from the shimmering constellation of stars on display in this production, from performers, to musicians, to conductor, to designer, to director. everyone involved in this production hit their straps. and of course handel's music is sublime. quite a few times i got up and started applauding, only to realise i was sitting at home. this is fun, exciting and entertaining stuff. exactly what opera should be. i cannot praise this highly enough. i have now bought 4 glyndbourne productions, and each one is as outstanding as the next. i daresay they are not capable of a bad production. this is a long opera, but the time just flies by. i had an ear-to-ear grin from start to finish, telling myself what an inspired purchase this was. do yourself a favour, and add it to your collection - right now!
