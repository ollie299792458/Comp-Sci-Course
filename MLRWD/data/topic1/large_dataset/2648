Going in to see this movie, i was not concerned with historical accuracy.  It's a movie about a freaking resurrected mummy, for crying out loud, i think that should be anyone's first hint that viewers are in for a nice little detour from reality, and all tghe better for it.  Picking up several years after the adventures of the first film, we rejoin what is now the O'Connell family as they cross paths with Imhotep once again, this time in an effort to stop him from raising a supernatural army that would allow him to conquer the world.  The Mummy Returns is the sort of movie that makes a fun distraction on a lazy Saturday afternoon, not unlike the hokey, cheesy (but nonetheless entertaining) monster movies i grew up with.  If you can put down your pretensions that every movie should be or should even strive to be the highest form of art, make yourself some popcorn, sit back, put a few parts of your brain in neutral and just enjoy the ride.  Yeah, some of the effects bite pretty hard, but so what?
