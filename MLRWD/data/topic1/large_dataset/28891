I cannot believe that ABC canceled this amazing show!!! It is unlike any other with its whimsical settings, amazing cast, and creative story lines. One would think that week after week seeing Ned bring people back from the dead for a minute to find out their killer would get boring and the plot would be predictable, but it is always a delight.
I, along with many of you who fell in love with this treasure, have written to ABC expressing my feelings towards their ridiculous decision. I know that these are hard times and everyone is trying to make sure that their decisions make financial sense. But then again, during these hard times should we not have something that can give us hope and bring us the kind of joy that this show brings to many of us??!
This show has just started to really unfold, with Chuck's father being brought back and his disappearance because of Ned and Chuck's relationship. Now we won't know. Good job ABC. Pat yourself on the back once you see how many loyal viewers you will be losing.
