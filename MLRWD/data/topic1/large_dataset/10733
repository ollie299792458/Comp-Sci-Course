Nick Wells (Robert DeNiro) is a master thief with a lot of discipline and is very versatile in any situation. Nick is planning on retiring soon but his close friend, Max (Marlon Brando) talks Nick into taking part in a very big gamble with a large payoff. Nick is sent into this job which breaks his key rules. 1."Always work alone" 2."Never work in the town you live in." Nick will have to partner up with Jack Teller (Edward Norton), a rookie thief who thought up this risky heist and he will also have to work near his own home. This is simply an exciting and suspenseful heist movie that contains three generations of actors. Each with powerhouse performances. The film does very well at giving the characters background history/ background stories and tying them into the main film. Sure the story of an impossible theft may sound familiar but that doesn't mean the movie can't be good. The movies which are good we remember and those which aren't we forget. The Score is one of the films to be remembered, it is presented in a new and fresh way and the initial heist is very creative. It is very gripping and a smart film. Edward Norton puts on an amazing performance in the powerful drama American History X and this is another one of his great onscreen performances. The chemistry between the actors is very good and Director Frank Oz does a good job too. (Frank Oz is also a puppeteer who controls Yoda in the Star Wars series.)
