The 2002 edition of Summerslam was, without a shadow of a doubt, the best pay per view of 2002. Every match was awesome and delivered in a huge way, in my opinion, this may very well be the best Summerslam ever, here's my breakdown of the PPV and I rate at a bust of five stars.(1-5)
Kurt Angle vs Rey Mysterio
*****
-Maybe the best opener ever. Rey and Kurt gave it everything they had. There was techncial wrestling, luche libre wrestling and submission wrestling all wrapped into one. This match just goes to show that even though Angle and Rey have completely opposite styles, they both can deliver one hell of a match.
Chris Jericho vs Ric Flair
****
-A great match wrestled by these two, a very well wrestled submission match. Jericho and Flair both used their trademark submission holds and at the end, "The Nature Boy" takes the victory by making Jericho tap out to the Figure 4 Leg Lock.
Edge vs Eddie Guerrero
****
-Another great mid-card match. Both of these wrestlers have similar styles as they both use technical and high flying offense. This match was a terrific bout and certainly once again proves that both individuals deserve to be main-event wrestlers.
WWE Tag Team Championship:
Lance Storm & Christian(c) vs Booker T and Goldust
****1/2
-This must have been the greatest tag team match this year! Booker T and Goldust work so well as a team and have good chemistry. The Un-Americans worked well together as well. This match literally had the fans on their feet as both teams put on an amazing match.
Test vs Undertaker
****
-A great brawling match, both Undertaker and Test were so intense in this match. The Undertaker came out on top with the Tombstone Piledriver to get the win.
WWE Intercontinental Championship:
Chris Benoit(c) vs Rob Van Dam
****1/2
-These great matches are what the WWE is all about. These two had a great match and clashed their styles together to make an amazing Intercontinental Title match. With RVD's unike high flying style and Benoit's technical style, this match is probably the best Interconinetal Title match in quite some time.
Non-Sanctioned Match:
Shawn Michaels vs Triple H
*****
-A tremendous showdown between these two! There were tables, chairs, and ladders! Both men brutalized eachother and Shawn Michaels proved that he is still "The Heartbreak Kid". HBK dove off ladders and beat Triple H to a bloody pulp and picked up the victory. This match makes Hulk Hogan vs The Rock from Wrestlemania look like Albert vs Hugh Morrus.
WWE Undisputed Championship:
The Rock(c) vs Brock Lesnar
****
-An okay match but this match pales in comparision to the prior match. Brock destroyed The Rock with suplexes and mauled him the entire match it seemed. When the bell was rung, there was a new WWE Undisputed Champion and the dawning of a new era because Brock Lesnar came out on top after he delivered the F-5 to The Rock.
-All in all, Summerslam delivered in every way and I strongly encourage people to buy this DVD-
