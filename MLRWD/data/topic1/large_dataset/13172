I didn't want to love the opera, Rigoletto, because I found the plot implausible:

  How could a girl continue to love a worthless philandering man who thinks women exist only to be used?

  Yet, I decided to give it a fair shot--to watch it clear through to see if the plot could make sense.

  OK.  Maybe you'll say I was just under the spell of the gorgeous music and the incomparable precision and feeling of the singing of Edita Gruberova as Gilda.  Or perhaps it was the exhilarating experience of hearing Pavarotti at his peak, just dominating every scene.

Perhaps it was the excellent performance by Ingar Wixell as Rigoletto, or the superb supporting performances by Ferruccio Furlanetto and Victoria Vergara as Sparafucile and his sister, Maddalena--I can't imagine anyone doing those roles any better.

  I remember a song where the theme, and perhaps the title, was "Just My Bill."  It was a woman singing about her Bill and his habits of running around, drinking too much, and abusing her--but she still loved him with all those faults.

  Offensive as that kind of love seems to me (and to Rigoletto) that was Gilda's kind of love--and she proved it.

  I just have to remind myself that this is opera, that the point of it all is beautiful music, beautifully sung, as it tells a story.

  This performance of Rigoletto certainly triumphs in every category--it made me love it.
