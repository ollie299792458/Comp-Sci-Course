This BD is listed as 'RegionA/1' by Amazon.For all you Australian buyers out there....it plays perfectly...and I don't have a multi-zone BD player...unlike the US-we can't buy them here-yet.
For that matter "Mutiny on the Bounty" has never been available here even on dvd.
So, I guess we'll never get the BD either-so-get it from Amazon US.
Pic & audio are superb. If you think the upscaled dvd will do-forget it.
Forget all the negative reviews, the behind the scenes dramas - all movies have those....this is truly an epic movie, beautifully shot and produced and a magnificent music score by Bronislau Kaper.
Sure, it hasn't had the stunning 8K scan such as South Pacific, How the West Was Won, Ben-Hur, Patton...but these are truly 'benchmark' BD's and are few and far between.
Will 2012 finally be the year we see the upcoming 8K scan of the ultimate masterpiece "Lawrence of Arabia"...
we can only live in hope.
I ordered this along with "My Fair Lady" BD and they arrived in about 10 days....fantastic service as always from Amazon US.
