A sensational film by Woody Allen! But it can be a bit of a mix for some people..Some Woody Allen fans loved this film, and some were disappointed. However, I fall into the category that loved it. To me, Woody Allen is NEVER a disappointment. He has to be one of the best film-makers of all time.

We start out seeing two screenplay writers, one who writes comedy, the other drama. It's a bit of a feud between the two, to discuss which is better..tragedy or comedy. We see one version of Melinda who is completely tragic. She is divorced, unstable, in complete hysterics. While, we see another Melinda who has well..seen her fairshare of unhappiness, but is quite optimistic and fun when it comes to life.

I absolutely LOVED Radha Mitchell in this film, I thought she shined. Others I thought did well were Jonny Lee Miller and Chiwetel Ejiofor. I honestly found Chloe Sevigney to be annoying (which I usually dont.) If you loved Anything Else by Woody Allen, I believe you'll like Melinda & Melinda as well!
