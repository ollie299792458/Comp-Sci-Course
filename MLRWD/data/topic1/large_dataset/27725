This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Schama is a witty, insightful and thoroughly entertaining host, and the series has excellent production values. Each segment is like a little film, composed around a central drama in the artist's life. It is a novel way to look at art, quite contrary to our normal view of art as a rather sedate, passive experience involving staring quietly in sterile galleries. Schama really gets across the passion and force of these artists and how powerful their works were in their original context. To some degree, he chose artists with interesting lives rather than interesting work so we dont get velazquez, hals, rubens, or sargent, but we do get david, picasso, and rothko. Even if you dont particularly like the artist in question, Schama's commentary still makes it worthwhile.
 If this series is ever released on bluray I will definately purchase it. (really art this spectacular (thinking mainly of rembrandt here) needs to be on bluray.) Also, I would love to see a sequel with 8 more artists!
