This video is Not Disney quality. It animation was obviously computer generated and got even silly in some scenes where the dogs face was "messed up" by the computer. And the Siamese Cats did not look like the cats in the original movie - and they were major stars in that one.
I am a MAJOR fan of Lady and the Tramp, I watch it several times a week for years now. (ok I am a bit obsessive with it).  But I could not even sit through this video - the songs were awful, the plot was - I think just making songs, and it was not in the style of the old movie.  In the original, you never saw "Jim dear" or "Darlings" faces - there was a reason for this - it made them inclusive to the public. Well in this video, you see all the faces.
Final point, the movie was a cross between, the Billy Joel - Oliver &amp; Company, A Little Mermaid, and the Lion King.  All good movies, but put them together and Junk (and not junk yard dog).  Disney should not have made this the sequel to such a great movie.  Or if they were, they should have put more effort and love into it.  It was not here.
