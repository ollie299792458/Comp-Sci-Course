After watching this film the first thing I said to Yoko(my wife) was, "That was great, even better than SE7EN".  Well.....after watching it again I realized that it probably wasn't, but the fact that it  is a relatively unknown title made me make the statement.
The story flows  along in a similar vein to that of SE7EN, with the killer manipulating the  the parties connected to the murder investigations in order to meet his  goal of fame(as a serial killer).  My only reservation is the fact that  Harry Connick Jr. has a relatively minor part in the movie.  The opening  scene featuring Harry and Sigourney is fantastic, leaving you one the edge  of your seat for the rest of the film.
With regards to the DVD, the  quality is good, but definitely not as good as the Amazon report leads you  to beleive.  I found that the encoding of the DVD seemed to be constantly  trying to 'settle down', even in still scenes, almost giving the effect of  very faint interference.  This seems to be something to do with the nature  of encoding found on region 1 Warner titles, which is not apparent on  region 2 releases (this is a note for those of you with multi-region  players, i.e many European users).  The effect is good on some disks (such  as Matrix) as it removes the distinct contours between colors that is  sometimes apparent due to MPEG2 encoding, but in this case I found it too  obvious, and distracting.  It produced a more 'digitized' feel in fact.  Overall though, a damn good movie, but to multi-region owners, it may be  worth checking out other releases.
