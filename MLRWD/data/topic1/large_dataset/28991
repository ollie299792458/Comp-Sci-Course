Favorite Line in this film... "Who the F&%K! Are You?!" A nice greeting for someone who just saved their bacon! Alice does live here and she owns this property! Our favorite genetically enhanced female weapon (courtesy of the Umbrella corporation) has been selected to face off against another type of genetically altered human weapon to see which type would serve best for the Umbrella weapons division and military application. But the fun doesn't stop there. They also threw in a hundred thousand Zombies running around the now infected Raccoon City! What more could one ask for? Oh, and our small rag tag group of humans have to somehow escape the now locked down city before dawn before the place gets sanitized by a nuke. Enough pressure for one movie? Oh Ya! I'd buy that for a dollar!
PQ is excellent! Solid blacks, colors, great detail and all shot at night. SQ is very dynamic and my downstairs neighbors hate me. Cool new genre right here. Action / Horror / Zombie Fest / Nuke films. Can't wait for the third one!
