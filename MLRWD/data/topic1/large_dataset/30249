I loved this movie!

I watched a rental copy here on Amazon.com 6 times then I bought the Blu-Ray/DVD copy so I could have it in my movie library.

Some of my favorite actors are in the movie, Ben Stiller, Eddy Murphy and Alan Alda.

The plot is clever and the ending is very unexpected.  I won't go through the entire movie but in a nutshell, here's what happens.

Ben Stiller's character Josh Kovacs is the General Manager of a high priced condo building in New York called The Tower.  Each unit in the building costs $5 million or more dollars and comes with a staff that caters to the owners 24/7.  Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) is a big time money manager who owns the penthouse apartment.  Early in the movie, we see the FBI arrest Arthur Shaw for fraud and theft.  We find out that Josh Kovacs had asked Arthur Shaw to manage the pension money for the staff at the Tower so everyone has lost their money.  After one employee tries to commit suicide, Josh decides to take matters into his own hands and try to find Arthur Shaw's secret stash of money.  He believes it could be hidden in a wall safe.  So Josh recruits some of the other people in the building, employees and one former owner to help him break into Arthur Shaws apartment.

Without giving away the whole plot, the movie is about how they go about doing this and the ending is very unexpected.  I really enjoyed this movie and I can't wait to get my copy from Amazon.com.
