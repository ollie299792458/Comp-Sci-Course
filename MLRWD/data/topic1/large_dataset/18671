Bryan Singer's Superman Returns is a masterful restarting of the Superman franchise.  While advancing the characters in surprising ways, particularly the relationship between Superman and Lois Lane, the film pays respectful homage to the 1978 classic Superman: the Movie.  Think of everything you liked about Richard Donner's film:  the quotable script, the mix of humor and spectacle, the antagonistic relationship between hero and villain, then amp it up.  Instead of one chunk of Kryptonite there is an island of it; instead of a glance of Noel Neill there is an important scene with her, instead of a near fatal accident/rescue with a helicopter, there is an entire jetliner at risk, etc.  Brandon Routh's interpretation of the Man of Steel and Clark are wonderfully similar in earnestness to Christopher's Reeve's, yet there is a subtlety in Routh's depiction of the very human Clark Kent, that is humorous without being cartoony.  The special effects are eye-popping and suspenseful.  The brutal treatment of Superman by Kevin Spacey's awesomely evil Lex Luthor is nearly terrifying.  Superman's unbelievable feats of strength are the stuff of new iconographic imagery.  The script by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris is well written and respectful with no cringe-inducing silliness.  The symphonic score remaking John Williams' music from the `70s is inspiring.  New characters like Lois's child Jason and her fiance Richard White are sensitively  played by Tristan Leabu and James Marsden, and Kate Bosworth's Lois has many of the film's best scenes. With stunning art direction and cinematography this a terrific and satisfying movie.  Superman's cape rippling in the wind is a thing of beauty and so is this movie. Routh and Singer should be proud.
