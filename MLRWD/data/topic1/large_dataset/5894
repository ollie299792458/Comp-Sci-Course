Galaxy Quest will have you rolling on your living room floor.  It's a parody of the Star Trek series and its fans, but it isn't mean-spirited in this ribbing.  Fans of the series who don't take themselves too seriously will be able to thoroughly enjoy this movie.  Tim Allen plays the domineering captain of an old science fiction television show called Galaxy Quest.  The way he tries to steal attention from his co-stars is taken directly from William Shatner's grandstanding.  The stand-out performance comes from Alan Rickman as Dr. Lazarus, the Spock of the Galaxy Quest series.  Tim and Alan are continually sniping at each other which brings on the laughs.
The story opens with the cast of Galaxy Quest making an appearance at a convention for Galaxy Quest fans.  Obviously, the only one who is enjoying it is the captain.  All of the other cast members are in living hell.  During the convention, even the captain loses his enthusiasm.  While in a deep depression, he is contacted by some strange fans who turn out to be real aliens.  Can the washed-out actors of Galaxy Quest handle a real space crisis?  Check it out.  You'll laugh yourself to death.
