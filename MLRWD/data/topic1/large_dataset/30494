These movies start off like an educational movie and you wonder if you'll continue to watch them but keep on watching. They are not your typical movies and that is what is funny about them.
 A Coke bottle falling from the sky starts the whole first movie story going. A little bushman tries to get rid of the bottle by throwing it off the edge of the earth. He leaves his family to go to the edge of the earth and along the way encounters  a bumbling scientific ,cute guy and a city girl who meet there in Africa.  The story twists and turns and you'll be entertained the whole way to the end. And it all started with the Coke bottle.
 The second Movie is similarly filmed but the story is about a cute dark haired lawyer girl from the city who goes to Africa for a meeting.  A handsome guy like a park ranger type meets her and offers to take her for a short tour of the land by a very small 2 seater aircraft , they start out together in the plane and he becomes separated from it . The plane crashes  they both end up wandering around the bush and the desert trying to find each other. There are many twists and turns in this story that will have you laughing. The little bushman winds up there too. There is also some suspenceful stuff happening in both movies.
