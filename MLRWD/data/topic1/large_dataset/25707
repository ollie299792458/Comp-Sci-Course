Ignore all moans and groans about Heat being too long, because in all honesty i couldn't get enough of it. Michael Mann has to be one of the most  underated directors of our time, his visual style, themes and atmosphere in  all his films are incredible, he got snubbed at this years oscars, though  Heat still has to be his untouched masterpiece. Al Pacino and Robert Deniro  are both tremendous as the two leeds, two of the greatest actors both one  on one in a classic ying and yang structured crime thriller, Heat being the  only film since the godfather part 2 with them cast together, though it  doesn't stop there!  Some great supporting performances from val kilmer,  ashley judd, tom sizemore, jon voight etc, etc.  I can't actually find a  negative aspect of this movie, the dialogue, the music, the sub-plots, the  camera work, all briliant. The shoot-out alone is worth the cost of the  dvd. Both sound and picture quality are top notch on the disc, shame there  wern't any extra features besides a couple of trailers. This film ranks  among my favourates, a awsome powerhouse ride of a movie, soooo worth  buying....see it and love it.
