Shallow Hal is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It is about a not-so-good-looking guy who only wants to date beautiful women.  Then he is hypnotized by guru Tony Robbins so that he only sees people's inner beauty when he looks at them.  Fat and ugly girls who are beautiful inside look beautiful on the outside to Hal.  Soon he meets Rosemary, a sweet but extra large woman whom he thinks is thin and gorgeous.  What results is hilarious but touching at the same time.  Jack Black and Gwyneth Paltrow deliver stunning performances.  Gwyneth is especially effective playing both the skinny Rosemary and the fat Rosemary.  Surprisingly, we don't feel surprised when we see the fat Rosemary after being used to the skinny Rosemary, because she's still the same person.  If I had to pick a weakness to this movie, it would be Jason Alexander as Hal's best friend.  His character is so obnoxious.
The story has a very happy and satisfying ending.  In addition to being a very funny movie, there is also a valuable lesson to be learned from it--don't judge people by the way they look.  That is unfortunately something people tend to do in real life, so we could all take a lesson from this movie.
I give it thumbs up!
