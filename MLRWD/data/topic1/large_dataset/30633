I am not quite sure why I waited so long to buy Operation Livecrime on DVD. Afer all, Operation Mindcrime was one of my favorite albums of all time. I first saw Queensryche's video "Gonna get close to you" on Headbanger's Ball on MTV back when they showed videos from all different genres. I was blown away by the groups creativity in sound and visuals. I went on to pick up "Warning" and the "EP" and then "Operation Mindcrime" was released. There were no words to describe the album but it was the only cassette that stayed in my car for weeks. I went to see them live at the Philidelphia Spectrum on this tour when they opened up for Metallica. It was a highlight of my life. This leads me to now. I guess I was afraid that the video would take away from my memory of being there live. I was very wrong. This is a testament of a band in its prime. This is a band giving everything they had to the audience. This was and still is a band that recreate everything from the album. This is a must have for any Queensryche fan and any fan of Progressive Metal. Now I just can't wait to get my hands on "Operation Livecrime 1 and 2" in their entirety. The DVD is excellent in video and 5.1 sound and really allows the lucky watcher to feel as though he or she is there. If I had the money everyone would get a copy for next Christmas. Take it from the Ronster Monster.
