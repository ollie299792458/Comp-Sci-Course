My boyfriend is a long time Rush fan that has seen the band in concert 9 times since the early 1980's. I bought this DVD off of amazon.com for his birthday to surprise him. He received the order in just a few days, but when he put the DVD in the player, the only audio on the disc was the intros and the "special features." When he played the concert footage, the was absolutely no audio what so ever. He jumped through the various songs to see if it was just on one portion of the disc...but that was to no avail. Absolutely no audio at all. We tried two different DVD players in two different homes...and nothing. I sent amazon.com two different emails to get this problem resolved and get the DVD exchanged, but so far they have yet to contact me back. Needless to say, I am very disappointed in amazon.com. Instead of exchanging DVD's, I think that I will just take a refund and purchase the DVD from a local business. AMAZON.COM......CONTACT ME IMMEDIATLY!!! I only rated this item a single star because it would not let me leave zero stars.....and the zero stars is for amazon.com's lack of follow up. Susan Kehoe
