I have read most of Ayn Rand's books and I found the stories intriguing.  They are not like any other stories I have read.  They have a tendency to show why being a statist is bad for the individual and the country. It shows what happens when you are in a complete democracy where the people only elect people that use the taxes collected to give them a free ride until there are no more taxpayers.  Remind you of anyone.  I heard through some friends about this movie and I was very excited to see it.  It was only in theaters for a couple of weeks before they pulled it.

Well I was surprised how they wrote the screenplay I don't even remember if they used incredulous like the book does so much, I think it was Ayn Rand's favorite phrase; they followed the story of the first part of the book pretty well. I really like the actress who played Dabney Taggert being intelligent, hard working engineer and the actor who played Hank Reardon who was not intimidated by others and was a self made man.  The things that they were doing in the movie seemed to remind me of some of the things our government is trying to push down our throats.  Now I live in Chicago and as you can imagine that many people would not go see this movie on principle.  I think that people are not seeing it on purpose because they are afraid of what they might find out.  The building of the John Gault line with the Reardon metal and the bridge was pretty cool and I found it exciting.

If the movie is so bad, how come everyone in the theater I was in stood up and clapped after the movie and it was a Chicago theater?

I cannot wait until they release the Blue ray DVD.  I cannot understand the delay with all the other bad movies that come out right away. Why is the industry so afraid of this movie? It is like it is Citizen Kane and Hollywood is playing the William Randolph Hearst part of trying to kill it. I hope that parts two and three come out soon.
