When I watched this movie I didn't not know until maybe a half an hour later that is was about the Death Row Prostistute, Aileen.
This movie was so very, very good, the acting was superb and it really made you feel what was in Aileen's heart and that even though she made men victims she was a victim too, from being raped and beaten from the age of 8,which is such a shame. Again like I have said people need to get some help.
Charlize Theron portrayed her perfectly and looked so much like her, I could not believe it. It was like Aileen was not executed, it was like she was starring as herself, from the way she laughed to the way she walked, Charlize had her down-packed; she really knew her character. I also learned that Aileen had an lesbian lover by the name of Selby which I neglected to find that out when I watch Death Row Prostitue on A &amp; E or Court TV, which made the story more interesting and the reason she killed was to keep the love of Selby which she never got from anyone else especially her father because he didn't believe that she was raped by his bestfriend so he started beating her himself. I can not believe when parents do not believe their own children not know that because of that they might be creating monsters.
