This movie, which was based on Amy Tan's novel of the same name, is a great adaptation - you always have to worry about the quality of the characters and settings whenever they make a book into a movie, but this one wasn't a disappointment.  I won't tell you the plot of the movie, you can Wikipedia it if you really want to find out.  There are slight differences from the movie and the novel though, but not significant enough to affect the movie.

It is mostly in English, with the exception of the mothers' childhoods in Mandarian Chinese (but of course, the movie has subtitles for those scenes).  This is a great movie for anyone who enjoyed Amy Tan's book, or for someone looking for mother-daughter movies, or for Chinese culture (if you enjoyed other Chinese family movies like The Wedding Banquet and Eat Drink Man Woman, you will love this movie too).

It's a single disc.  There wasn't a lot of other qualities other than the movie itself.  Came within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping.  Arrived new, nothing was damaged during shipping, and disc was not scratched and worked fine.
