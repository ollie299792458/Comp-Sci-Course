THE LOST BOYS
*****
THIS IS POSSIBLY THE BEST VAMPIRE MOVIE WITH QUEEN OF THE DAMNED CLOSE BEHIND.  THE ENDING WAS BRILLIANT AND THE SONG THAT PLAYED IN THE CLOSING CREDITS WAS HAUNTING.  FOR ALL THOSE WHO DONT KNOW THE SONG. IT'S PEOPLE ARE STRANGE AND IT'S BY ECHO AND THE BUNNYMEN.  OK SO THE MOVIE WASNT FROM MY ERA SINCE I'M 17 AND I DIDNT EXPECT TO LIKE IT BUT MY COUSIN BOUGHT OVER THE DVD AND I WAS SHOCKED BY HOW GOOD IT WAS. KEIFER SUTHERLAND IN HIS ONLY GOOD MOVIE FROM THAT ERA SINCE PROMISED LAND STUNK. I'D BE EXTREMELY  HAPPY IF THEY RE RELEASED IT INTO THEATERS WITH DELETED FOOTAGE.  I WOULD GO SEE IT AS MANY TIMES AS I COULD AND THEN WHEN THE DVD CAME OUT I'D BUY IT SINCE IT'S MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIE.  OK SO NOW TO THE STORY MIKE IS THE NEW KID IN TOWN AND HE FALLS INTO THE WRONG CROWD. THE VAMPIRE CROWD.  THE REASON HE MOVED INTO TOWN IS BECAUSE HIS FAMILY WAS MOVING IN WITH THIER GRANDPA.  HIS MOTHER SUPERBLY PLAYED BY DIANE WEIST SUSPECTS HES WITH THE WRONG CROWD AND SO DOES EVERYONE ELSE.  SO RENT THIS AND ENJOY A TRULY GOOD MOVIE.  YOU WONT BE UPSET. YOU WILL ACTUALLY BE HAPPY THAT YOU RENTED IT.  I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH WATCHING IT.
