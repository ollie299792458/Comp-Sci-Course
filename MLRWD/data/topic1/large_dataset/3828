The creators of "Scary Movie" and "The Naked Gun" set their sights on the comic book genre in the latest big screen parody "Superhero Movie". After being bitten by a genetically enhanced super dragonfly, high school student Rick Riker (Drake Bell) develops superhuman abilities and learns that with great power comes great responsibility. Rick becomes the masked crime fighter Dragonfly and battles the life-draining villain Hourglass (Christopher McDonald) who seeks to become immortal by killing thousands of people. "Superhero Movie" is a decent spoof of the blockbuster "Spider-Man" franchise and other comic book movies like "Batman Begins", "Fantastic Four" and "X-Men". The 2008 comedy delivers a good dose of sight gags and gross-out humor. The cast also includes Sara Paxton, Kevin Hart, Brent Spiner, Jeffrey Tambor, Marion Ross, Tracy Morgan and Leslie Nielsen. "Superhero Movie" is a fair improvement over such recent lame parodies like "Date Movie", "Epic Movie" and "Meet the Spartans".

If you liked "Superhero Movie" in theaters, then you might want to check out the Extended Edition on DVD. The 2008 spoof of comic book blockbusters is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The extended edition includes a few minutes of additional footage not seen in theaters. The picture quality is very good and its 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is fairly enjoyable. Among special features, the DVD includes an alternate ending, 21 deleted scenes, theatrical trailer, "Meet the Cast" and "The Art of Spoofing" behind-the-scenes featurettes and audio commentary by writer/director Craig Mazin and producers David Zucker and Robert K. Weiss. Overall, "Superhero Movie" Extended Edition gets a "C".
