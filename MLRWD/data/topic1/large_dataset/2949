When I saw the Monster's Ball at the movie theatre for the first time a year ago shock was the first thing that came to my mind.  The screenplay was very well written, but the [traditional roles] left me thinking how could Halle Berry play such of a role.  Then I thought again if she didn't play the role then someonelese would, which still left me even more depressed and disappointed.  Halle Berry played every negative ...typical role that black women had to play in American cinematography since the beginning of time which have been mammy, maid and [women of the night].  
Ms. Berry played the role of mammy by being an ignorant mother who basically did not know how raise her son, but disciplined through beatings so severe and savage like that they were abusive. Next Ms. Berry, played a maid by working in a restaurant serving whites mostly and where she meets the male protagonist played by Billy Bob Thornton.  Finally, how Ms. Berry plays the most appalling role of all that of a [woman of the night].  I couldn't believe how Berry's character begged for ... relations with Mr. Thornton it disgusted me. 
I would like to say that most of mainstream America found this film to be a great, so great that Halle Berry won an Oscar.  I would like to know, is this how America views black people here in this country as mammies, maids, [women of the night], coons, toms and bucks? just waiting to be saved by that white knight.  My language might be strong and offense, but so was this film which was completly degrading to blacks here in America.
