Okay, I have never written a review on Amazon before, but I could not resist when it came to Gymkata. Let me start out by saying that I am a big fan of 80s movies. Gymkata is no exception, either. I saw this movie when I was 12, I think. We were all gymnasts back then, and there was this crazy move from Gymkata that we kept trying to do (when he is talking with the Princess, and playing the role of both parties). This movie had everything in it; love story, drama, suspense, comedy, thriller, and then some. I absolutely love this movie for the sheer cheesyness of it all. The princess is supposed to be Kurt Thomas' trainer, but never really teaches him anything, except an inferred, "Don't trust anyone." If you look closely, you'll see some recycled scenery. And I love when he's running through the town trying not to get shot; mind you, he decides to run in a RED sweater. Yes, he might as well have painted a big bulls eye on himself. And how his hands magically have chalk on them, and how poles are conveniently placed between buildings during chase. This is classic stuff. The story line talks about how all the nations of the world are training their fighters for the "Game," yet, only about 6 fighters show up. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love this movie, because it is sooooo cheesy and fun to watch. The sound effects are the same for every move during hand to hand combat. Plus, you will get a kick out of watching Kurt Thomas in the town of the crazies. My recommendation is that you purchase this oh so awesome film. It's one of a kind. Cheers!
