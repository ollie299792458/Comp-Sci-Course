..when the news of PBS broadcasting this TV movie on public TV back in the late summer of 1979, I read the reviews in the paper about this unusual sci-fi movie, which to me, had the veins and hints of the ITC 1968 TV limited series, "the Prisoner", with Patrick MaGoohan - the story of "dehumanization."

Thus, I set up my VCR, had a new tape in the machine and captured this one-performance event, that would escape us for all of these years until the announcement of the DVD release was made, which was like a re-encarnation of sorts in bringing out such a rare yet classic piece of film history.  As I watched this film while capturing it on tape which was presented in its entirety (which was unheard of in those days to see a movie on air TV without commericals. Yet, of course, this is PBS..), I sat with extreme awe on how deep and powerful this movie was and how the story evolved with character development, the plot and the ending.

True, if this story was ever remade as a feature motion picture, it would never have the charm and originality as this original PBS release.

I still have that original video tape of this film that I made in 1979.
