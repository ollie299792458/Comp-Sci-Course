This epic adventure pits Lee against hundreds(seemingly)on a deadly island fortress. Lee is sent to an international martial arts tournament as an agent to uncover the sinister plot of Mr. Han. The fight scenes are  incomparable to any before it or after. It's hard to beleive any human  being could possibly move that fast. One only has to blink and miss several  key techniques i.e. the start of the fight between Lee and Ohara, Lee's  lightning hook kicks to Han's face, the triple punch to Sammo Hung in the  title's opening duel to name but a few. Another element that sets Lee apart  from the rest, is his "emotional content" that is displayed so  beleivably real, one might think these men have truly been killed. Bob  Wall, the despicable Ohara has been quoted "there is little else as  terrifying as Bruce Lee staring you in the eyes with the look of total  commitment to your destruction!" In the scene where Bruce Lee kicks  Ohara into the tournament onlookers, the man Ohara flies into, actually  gets both arms broken from the impact! Whether you are a practicing martial  artist or just looking for a great way to kill (pun intended) a couple of  hours, I highly recommend this movie. Lee is truly awe inspiring!
