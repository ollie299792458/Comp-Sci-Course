There is no good and there is no bad in this movie. Compared to the great old westerns like Rio Bravo, this is completely different kind of a beast. There are no completely good characters and there are no completely bad characters in this film. Everything is grey. The movie is great ending to Eastwood's western roles. If I could ask one thing from mr Eastwood, that would be 'no more westerns, the Unforgiven was perfect'. I must say that this movie is not the best western - no - this is the best movie ever.
When I first saw this movie this was the first role I saw Morgan Freeman at after 'Robin Hood', after many succesfull movies I still consider this his best performance. As with mr. Eastwood, the role comparable only with the one in 'In the Line of Fire'. Gene Hackman in the role of the sadistic sheriff Little Bill makes the best performance that he has made on his long and succesfull career. To today their performance seems to last, great work indeed. As well as Eastwoods directing, well, maybe it suffices to say that he won the best picture and best directing Academy Award for the picture. What is shame, is that the he didn't get recoqnition of the acting performance, which was, to my opinion, best there has been.
In risking sounding chauvinistic, this is a man's movie. In saying of this I don't mean that a woman could not like this movie or even love it, I just feel that it appeals to men much more than women. There are no central roles for women in this movie. Though the women are in the midst of the actions of the movie, they are the driving force that make this movie to happen.
