I watched this documentary yesterday and have been unable to get it out of my mind. I kind of wish I never saw it and had I known the outcome, I might have passed it over. I have a 2 year old son and I ran upstairs to his room and held him while I cried. The feelings of sorrow and frustration the I feel are a mere scratch compared to the deep wounds that the Bagby's feel. Not only from Andrew's murder but than to have their grandson murdered by the same person. It is unbelievable that so much Devestation can happen to good people. She was truly an evil, spiteful, sick person. I can only hope that she is burning in hell right now.I feel so sorry for the Bagby's and how much pain and anger they must be experiencing. I would only pray that I may be spared that level of sadness and that someday they will find comfort.I am most disgusted by the actions of judge welsh.She obviously in not fit to serve as an officer of the court and should be removed. Her actions contributed to zachary's death and she should be held accountable.I hope guilt follows her until her dying day.
Thanks for reading and many prayers and blessings to the Bagby's and their friends.
