I am an avid movie watcher.....I have been for most of my life. My collection is widely diverse and between vhs and dvd I now have over 800 movies. This movie, "The Grey Zone" , I just happened to stumble upon years ago when I still rented from video stores and vhs was still on the market. This production is a retelling of what went on at one of the many concentration camps during WWII. This particular camp was in Germany and was one of the most brutal. I am not sure if there is an exact number on people that were tortured and murdered there. Even if it had only been 1 it would have been too many regardless. I took a chance on renting this movie and I am so glad that I did. There are many fine performances and Harvey Keitel's is really outstanding. Steve Buscemi is good as always and Mira Sorvino's character performance is one that can leave you with tears in your eyes. The story is centered around the building up and action of the only armed revolt by the Jewish prisoners to ever happen at Auschwitz. I HIGHLY recommend this movie if you love true stories and especially those about what happened during these dark days....you will NOT be disappointed..I guarantee!!!
