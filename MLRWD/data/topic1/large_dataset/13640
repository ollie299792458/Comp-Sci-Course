Usually sequels are not as good as the originals, sometimes they just flat out suck. This is not the case with X2, in fact it is better than the original. X2 grabs you from the beginning and smacks you around like the naughty child you are with an outstanding opening action sequence where Night Crawler breaks into the White House and tries to send a message to the president. This is by far the best action sequence of the year 2003. With the amazing special effects that actually make Night Crawlers teleporting look real, the exhilarating music track, and a** kicking action, it is obvious from the beginning that this is film making at its finest. 
The makers of both these films did such a great job in not only making the X-Men seem real, but they were able to present them in a manner that was not corny, and found a way around the multi colored spandex of the comic book. In addition, they stay very true to the comic book and in no where is this more evident in the portrayal of Wolverine and the intense rage he possesses. In fact during the scene when Wolverine was rumbling with the invading special forces in Professor X's school, I almost jumped out of my chair and proclaimed "OH GOD, YES!"  
X2 has great action, great writing, great directing, great production, and great acting. It is a must own and to date the greatest comic book to movie film ever made.
