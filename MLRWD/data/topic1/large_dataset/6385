"The Omen" is one of the scariest movies I've seen by far. A few days after I saw this movie, I couldn't get the music or the ending out of my head. I won't spoil the ending for those who hadn't seen it, but I will tell you that it is an ending you won't forget. The movie stars Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as a couple living in London, England who adopt a 6-year-old boy who is thought to be the son of Satan. He kills a lot of people by using his powers or his evil smile. He has a number called 666, which is the mark of the Anti-Christ. His parents are unaware at first that he {Damien} is evil, but Robert Thorne {Peck} soon sees and hears many deaths to come and then realizes Damien's true identity. Gregory Peck is always a fine actor, and here he gives one of his most thought-provoking and real performances. His character, Robert Thorne, loves his wife, Kathy {Lee Remick} so much and is worried about her. He has many tender moments with her, and also some moments of terror. There are many moments in this movie that I will never forget. The music is the thing that scares me the most. Jerry Goldsmith won a richly deserved Oscar for his score in 1976. Try to find some time to watch a serious horror movie like this one. I garrantee it will stay with you for a while.
