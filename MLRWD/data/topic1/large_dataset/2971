First off, the still screen images and the DVD cover art (if you can call it that) really don't do this great little independent film justice.  If you've seen the design of the Terrans you might think this film is silly or only for kids.  It's not. It's great, moving, beautiful to look at and probably the best Sci-Fi movie and animated film I've seen in quite some time. This film has an ending that no Pixar or Dreamworks director would touch.  It doesn't leave you with that empty feeling like a lot of animated films do - at feeling of disconnect.  It's a  heart-felt film with big ideas.  As one reviewer said, it made me think "What would I do it a situation like this?"  If you're worried about the celebrity voices or stunt casting, don't.  David Cross is perfect and actually quite serious in his role.  Evan Rachel Wood makes you care for her Terran character.  James Garner is haunting as an elder Terran.  Justin Long is funny as usual.  Luke Wilson was a surprise as well.  The director has created a perfect little world that I want to go back to again and I might just upgrade to Blu-ray for this movie alone.  The music is terrific.  If you're a lover of world-building sci-fi and great animated films you owe it to yourself to buy it. I recommend this highly to any fans of animated scif-i movies like Light Years, Fantastic Planet, Heavy Metal and Titan A.E. just to name a few.
