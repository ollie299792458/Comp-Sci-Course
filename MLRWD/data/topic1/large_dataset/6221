I really enjoyed this movie.

It seems that the bulk of the negative reviews fall into two categories: 1. It wasn't as good as the original. 2. It wasn't true to the Greek legend.

Well,
I didn't see the original.
I know the legend but not in great detail.
I think movies can stand on their own merits.

I'm a fan special effects, especially creatures, and this movie had excellent effects and great creatures -- Medusa, very cool. I'm also a fan of costume dramas, especially the Sword and Sandal genre. The costumes, sets, and atmospherics in general were excellent. The gloomy look and moody score were superb -- not like the bright sunny Greece of real life but quite appropriate for a time of war with the gods. The acting was really good too -- with all those great Brits and Aussies, you can't go wrong. The action was quick and well choreographed.

My only regret was that the story and the dialog could have been richer, snappier, punched up a notch, less predictable, and the characters could have used more personality -- those fine actors could have handled anything.

All in all an enjoyable film.
