I unfortunately do not own a copy of this wonderful piece of work...although I have seen it several times.  It is getting terribly difficult to find these days and I will soon buy my personal copy to keep.
Now to the review:  This should be required in every school across the land.  This is one of, if not, the best documentaries I've ever seen.  Nothing is left to the imagination in this....cold hard facts about what a farce world we all live(d) in.
Some other reviewer wrote that he thought this was propaganda about propaganda...well if this is propaganda written about the governments propaganda then doesn't that make this the truth if the governments version is propaganda?
Anyway, it's about as close to the truth as you are ever gonna get...and it's a whole lot better than the garbage they teach you at school...which is basically nothing truthful to begin with.
For all those people out there who want to remain in their 'Happy-go-lucky' denail prozac world...avoid this video at all costs....you might actually learn something for real.  Anyway, you might not be able to change things but why the heck would you not want to know about them?
For anyone out there who says the truth of history, or of anything for that matter, does not matter to them, then please send me your address and the make and color of your car.  You are the perfect target for a robbery as you aparently careless about anything enough to want to know about it.....oh yeah...of course your car is more important than knowing your history isn't it?
Anyway, terrific video, great documentary...perfect work in my opinion...anything that gets right into the facts with both eyes wide open is perfect.
