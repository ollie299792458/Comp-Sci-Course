Although many argue about the meaning of his films, few will debate Fellini's impact on cinema and popular culture. I find it amusing how many people try to find a moral message in his films and characters. The brilliance of his films is that characters  are presented without sympathy or scorn. They simply exist like fleeting emotions. Sure, you'll love, envy and hate Marcello's character all at the same time. That's a lot like real life. Feminists always hate Fellini's portrayal of women as sex objects. Get a critical life! The same director who gave us La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2 turned around and made a brilliant film about a middle aged woman's point of view in "Juliette of the Spirits".

Returning to la Dolce Vita, Fellini seems as obsessed as we are with the celebrity lifestyle and glitz of the famous. This film is oddly prescient in predicting that mania for the rich and famous. I'll go out on a limb here and say that fans of Reality TV Shows will find La Dolce Vita oddly familiar. Let's not forget the strange photographer who hangs around Marcello named "Paparazzo". This cinematic leech is precisely where the term "Paparazzi" comes from... Fellini foresaw that bizarre pop culture vulture would be increasingly a participant in celebrity lives (and deaths) as well as a chronicler.

In spite of all this, Fellini's films are fun. He seems to have the unique ability to breezily make biting social commentary, while at the same time showing us all the decadent fun we want. Perhaps the final word is that Life is Sweet, no matter how screwed up it is. Like this film, the best thing is to just jump in and experience it.
