Where some films choose Conrad's Heart of Darkness, some follow the darkness into light. This film demonstrates the ubiquitous human spirit to find the humanity in the inhumane. It is a story untold by the Japanese and impaled upon foreign debate by the Chinese. However, when we look at individual accounts and heroics, this film has taken flight in that wind. Symbolic uses of color in bleak cityscapes (as opposed to glorious landscapes) ravaged by war highlight the subtleness of true heroism in times of turmoil. How easily heroics can be lost! The viewer will want to believe in this story to the depth and capacity of the human soul. The cinematography and soundtrack align impeccably. Though Christian Bale's performance is sometimes a bit hokey, at times, the viewer must love the drunkard-turned hero, compassionate beyond the call of his loins for a lovely whore. The girls foiling the prostitutes allow for that grand forgiveness of imperfection. This allows for Bale's character "Father John" to redeem himself as the man who protects children, as opposed to the self-serving character of the drunkard mortician we are introduced to at the beginning of the movie. The plot is foreseen, but the emotional impact takes the viewer by surprise. Do not be without tissues at the completion of the movie. Those with compassionate and dreamy hearts, and especially those who have known sacrifice, will appreciate the care placed in this film. It is full of passion and pain, the kind of movie we should all strive to see made in Hollywood.
