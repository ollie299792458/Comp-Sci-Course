These three yoga programs are my favorite yoga of all time.  I originally had the VHS tapes of these and I played them so much that the tapes wore out!  I was very excited to see that these programs were now available on one DVD.  Energize, Tone and Sweat are the three programs.

I had a very different experience than several of the reviewers who didn't like this DVD.  It's almost as though we were watching totally different DVDs.  This brings home the point that yoga is a very individual practice.

I am an advanced exerciser who does mainly weight training and intense cardio.  I've been practicing yoga for about 8 years and consider myself a high intermediate.

It seems the stronger I get, the harder these yoga routines become.  I think this is because as my strength and balance improve, I am going deeper into the poses.  I'm also holding the poses longer.  Thanks to yoga, I am so much more aware of my body and can really isolate exactly where I should be feeling a pose.

Why I love this DVD:

**It's yoga that grows with you.  You can make the practice as easy or as hard as you like.

**No "impossible" poses like head stand or full crow.

**I feel so calm, yet energized after finishing.

**Bryan's calming voice is relaxing on its own.

**Bryan gives just enough instruction and doesn't go on endlessly about a pose.  I have found this to be a major annoyance with other yoga workouts, most notable Cathe Friedrich and Tracey Staehle yoga programs.

**The calming music suits the workout.

**The set, that of an old warehouse with brick walls and wooden floors fits the mood of the workouts.

There are a few things to note in these workouts.  I don't consider them to be negatives.  Here are the things:

**Bryan doesn't give a lot of form pointers.  To get the most out of this workout, you should be somewhat familiar with the various yoga poses.

**Bryan usually doesn't give the yoga terms for the poses.  For example with fierce pose, he just says to bend your knees and raise your arms.  It wasn't until I did subsequent yoga workouts by other instructors that I learned the official pose names.

**Even though I love all three programs, I couldn't really tell the difference between the three.  I felt that I was able to Energize, Tone and Sweat in each program.

**The only chaptering in this DVD is between the 3 programs.

**The production quality isn't great.  I think they had to convert the VHS tapes onto DVD, so there wasn't a lot to work with.

I highly recommend this DVD.  It has stood the test of time.
