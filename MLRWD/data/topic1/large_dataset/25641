With this new 2-disc release, Disney Studios finally "got it right."  Kudos to the technical specialists who cleaned up the animation sequences and the soundtrack irregularities that have plagued every release of "Mary Poppins" ... until now! The 5.1 Surround Mix is superb and the sound engineers have equalized the voices during the songs that contained dialogue that was dubbed into the sequence, so now it is hardly noticeable. The Disney Home Theater Stereo Mix is even better than the original stereophonic theatrical release. It was just thrilling to watch the opening credits and see the actual care and love gone into cleaning up the original artwork.  Here is a Textbook Example of how to digitally restore a movie without destroying it (are you listening, George Lucas?).

A technical note: This edition is listed as being widescreen (1.66:1) whereas my 1998 edition of "Mary Poppins" listed a screen ratio of 1.88:1.  Whichever it is, it is the same screen ratio as the 1998 edition (thankfully).

"Mary Poppins," in my opinion, has always been the best film Walt Disney ever produced, and the care he took in producing it is evident in the casting (especially the cameo roles). Robert Stevenson's direction is classic and unobtrusive; the editing is well-paced; the cinematography perfect.  It is no wonder this film won 5 Academy Awards, mostly for technical achievements and the music, and of course one big one for Best Actress to Julie Andrews in her film debut!
