I only gave it a one for three reasons.

First off one of the soldiers makes the claim that Halliburton makes 24 bucks a plate, even if empty, with nothing to back this claim. It's probably nothing more than a made up story. He lost all credablility with me when he then made the claim that Dick Cheney runs Halliburon and is making money off this war. He needs to be educated because Dick Cheney quit Halliburton in 2000.

Second the Muslim guy in this film annoys me. It's the typical sympathize with the enemy attitude that I cant stand. First he tries to make a comparison that makes no sense. He says what if Canada invaded the USA, I'm sure lots of Bush lovers would pick up their guns and fight back. Ok let's get this straight. First off if Canada invaded I would kill Canadians, not my own people in the markets and churches. Those people are not trying to liberate their country, they are trying to cause choas and kill their own people, women and children. Second Saddam was a war criminal who gased his own people and is responsible for chemicals getting thousands of our soldiers sick in the first gulf war. There is no comparsion. His typical, "I side with my people" attitude sickens me and turned me off from the film.

Third, there is hardly any action. If you want to see an action film, this is not for you. It's more complaining than anything.
