The Peanuts cartoons defined the holiday season for me as a child.  Like many other children, I eagerly anticipated the televised broadcast of the "Great Pumpkin" or the "Charlie Brown Christmas" programs.  In fact, if I missed the program on television, I felt as if the holiday was not complete.  Therefore, I was more than happy to purchase the set on DVD.

These DVDs typically run around $15 each in-store.  It winds up being cheaper to simply purchase the collection in one fell swoop.  You can sometimes find a copy that includes an inflatable Snoopy chair for kids.  Cheesy, I know, but at least it doesn't cost extra, and it's kinda cute if you have young children.

Let's be honest: buy the collection if only for the Great Pumpkin and the Christmas special.  I like the Thanksgiving story, but to me it seems weak when compared to the other two.  "A Charlie Brown Christmas" is easily my favorite of the three. In addition, the collection contains one extra cartoon per disc.  The second cartoon on the Thanksgiving disc, "The Mayflower Voyagers," is fairly good.

So, instead of paying $45 to purchase the discs separately, just make the one purchase.  You won't be sorry, and neither will your kids! The Peanuts Gang offers the type of wholesome family entertainment that proves harder and harder to find every holiday season. ~LBS
