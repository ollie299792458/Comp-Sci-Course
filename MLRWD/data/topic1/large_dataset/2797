Many thought this would be the Vietnam film to end them all. Parts of this long film ARE BRILLIANT. The opening sequences are stunningly atmospheric - VITTORIO STORARO's Cinematography is Superb. Martin Sheen's voice - over narration is another successful ingredient of the film. But the movie is also often slow and pretentious. It's action throws in every possible atrocity to shock the viewer: in words as well as in pictures Francis Ford Coppola plays heavily for effect. MARLON BRANDO is superb as Colonel Kurtz. Sheen hacks him to pieces, in a terribly GORY SEQUENCE, with a Machete to symbolise the simultaneous slaughter of a sacrificial buffalo. Coppola does attempt to balance his elements with injections of some black humour, including a superbly choreographed attack by helicopters to the music of 'RIDE OF THE VALKYRIE'. Robert Duvall gives one of the BEST PERFORMANCES of his career. Look-out for Harrison Ford in a very tiny cameo.
