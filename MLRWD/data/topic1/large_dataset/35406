As a child, I adored Totoro. So it was no surprise that I was more than eager to see the new 2 disc set of it. However, what I got was not all that I'd hoped for.

Totoro is a classic children's movie, and one of the best. The story is touching, and the characters endearing. But what was sorely missing from this re-release was a surprising lack of vocal talent. While the supporting cast was great, poor Satsuki and Mei were grossly miscast as Dakota Fanning and Elle Fanning. I wonder if Disney even auditioned children for these roles or just thought to themselves, "Hey, who is a popular child actor that might bring in money?" Satsuki (voiced by Dakota Fanning) sounds about 3 or 4 years too young for her age, and half the time she sounds dead. The other half of the time she delivers several of her lines very oddly and inappropriate for the scene that they are in. A good example would be when Satsuki offers an umbrella to Totoro, telling him to hurry and take it because her sister (whom she is carrying) is slipping. Ms. Fanning delivers this line in an excited, almost giddy manner, despite the fact that her character is currently shifting around the weight of a small child on her back. It just sounds odd. And Mei is just plain annoying. Half on Elle Fanning's lines are screeched out in such a high pitch voice it practically makes your ears bleed, and the other half of her lines are, literally, high pitched screams. These two young ladies ruined what would have been a decent dub (with the exception of the newly dubbed Catbus which is also disappointing).

My advice to you is to either buy a copy of the original dub of Totoro, or watch it in Japanese if you buy this version.
