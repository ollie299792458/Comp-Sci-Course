Anyone expecting to see expensive special effects and space ships exploding should look elsewhere, but for those seeking a more thoughtful, philosophical drama, you won't be disappointed. It's far better than the "Dallas/Dynasty soap opera but with robots" we feared, but so far hasn't quite gripped me like BSG did, but did cause me to continue to think about the issues it explores.

The story opens with a rather shocking display of gratuitous sex and violence in a virtual club created by teenagers where anything goes. This scene sets us up to explore the moral ambiguities of the world, and to discuss which is better/worse- the moral absolutism of deadly terrorists who claim to have a lock on good vs. evil and worship the one true god, vs. pantheistic people with vague morals who seem only to further their own selfish desires. Graystone states, "...only the gods have power over life and death? I don't agree."

So far there's really no definitive hero, no truly likable protagonist. The story is gripping, but makes me wonder if a story where we don't really root for any of the characters will hold our interest for long.

This is a thinking person's show that explores the classic "ghost in the shell" concept, and is done with finesse. I'm looking forward to more character development.
