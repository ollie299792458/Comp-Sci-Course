Only watch this movie if you are a major fan of any of the actors, or are purposely trying to watch crappy 80's horror films. I did not find this movie at all scary, but then, I'm not really sure it was supposed to be... Expect lots of bizarre camera angles (including the doorknob-cam, for example), and very stilted dialogue. On the other hand, I still very much enjoyed this movie, and have watched it several times since buying it. It's best to watch it really late at night. If you want to watch Sam Raimi ("Spiderman" movie director) act, this is the movie for you. If you want all the characters to live happily ever after, it is not for you. Infamous B-movie icon Bruce Campbell makes a brief (i.e. not longer than three minutes) appearance at the end, so don't be fooled by how often his name shows up headlining the credits. I personally bought this movie for the combined five minutes of Ted Raimi (Sam's little brother). He violences vegetables (and an innocent and unsuspecting watermelon), and bleeds very enthusiastically; unfortunately he is not a major character... The multiple deaths are not as explicit as they would be in a modern horror film, but they are creative; the blood content is rather moderate in most of them. I enjoyed it, despite its faults, and if you're in the right mood, you might, too.
