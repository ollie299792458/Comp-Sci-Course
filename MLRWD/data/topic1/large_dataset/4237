You're suddenly a terror suspect because of an errant cell phone call made to you? Sounds farfetched, yet that's the premise of this movie.  Anything can be used to tie someone to extremist.  What's next, spam? junk mail? facebook?  It almost wants to make you want to disconnect from everyone.

At one point in the movie, you think they got the right guy as Anwar "confesses" (after days of torture) to his connections with the extremist.  For a moment this scene, seems to justify the means of "gathering intelligence"; afterall, Anwar "confessed" to his connections....but the reality is, he doesn't have any connections with the extremist!

I can see how easy it is for my moral compass to be adjusted in only 1.5 hours because of his "confession". Can you imagine what would happen to us after days of psychological torture?  We'll all probably say and do whatever our tormentor wants us to....

Also enjoyed how the various sub-stories are intertwined, well crafted; so many characters trying to do the right thing, yet their actions push them far more into the world they all detest.

In my opinion, mind control is the ultimate objective of terrorist, afterall our minds and what we think about most, likely will dictate our course of action....
