This excellent collection covers the TV series quite well. The pilot is a remake of the theatrical movie; the reshoot resulted in a recast, and that lead to a whole new take on the main characters.

Fundamentally, Alien Nation is a two-themed work: (1) Police Drama (2) Social Commentary about racism in the modern world. Both themes are very evident, and in one's face, and both drive the series in interesting directions.

Gary Graham, playing Matthew Sykes, brings to life a character who doesn't realize how bigoted he really is, and over the course of the season, begins to realize just what a jerk he really is, and to overcome his own prejudices.

Eric Pierpont, playing George Sam Francisco, is the alien beat cop skipped over the humans by affirmative action protocols. Eric's take on George is very different in manerisms than Mandy Patinkin (who played George in the Theatrical movie), and is a strong, self-confident character.

The conversion to DVD is excellent, and the series was top-notch. (Yet another case of finding the audience only after being canceled!)

The story does not end with the series, however... it concludes with a series of Made-for-TV-Movies, which are not in this collection. Familiarity with the original theatrical release is neither essential nor harmful.
