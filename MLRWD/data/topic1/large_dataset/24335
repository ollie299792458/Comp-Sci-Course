This was a suspenseful thriller with so many twists and turns you had to keep watching so you wouldn't get lost ... but the watching was well worth it.  The end was perhaps one of the best and least suspected endings you could imagine.  It was well acted and fit nicely into current world events.  It demonstrated what heroes we have in our covert operations and some of the things they are willing to do for their country.  At the same time, you have feelings that the entire storyline could be heading in another direction.... you sometimes think the hero is a villian, and then, just when you see what's going on, everything seems to change.  All hope seems to be lost, and the hero seems to be doomed.  At that point you just wonder how many innocent people he will take with him... how far will he go to seemingly protect himself.  With hundreds of lives on the line you find yourself sitting on the edge of your chair waiting for the end to reveal itself... and that final twist is what makes this a very nice experience to watch.  I highly recommend this for several reasons... the excitement, the action, the many twists, and mostly the ending.... I liked this DVD!!!!
