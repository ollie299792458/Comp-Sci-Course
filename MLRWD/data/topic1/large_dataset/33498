What do you do to bring to life one of the more sinister comic book heroes ever?  First, find the brooding, muscle-clad Wesley Snipes to portray  the remorseless character, Stephen Dorrif as the ambitious, power hungry antagonist , the crusty Kris Kristofferson as the heroes supporter, and throw in the able directing of Stephen Norrington.  You get "Blade," a fine action film which some fantastic action sequences (despite the spotty special effects) and a storyline that keeps you interested.
The film follows Blade.  A powerful, cold Vampire Slayer, played impeccably by the imposing Wesley Snipes, who does make all other ficticious Vampire Slayers (Buffy ect.) look timid by comparison.  Blade himself is half vampire, who has all of their strengths (except slower aging) and none of their weaknesses (except their thirst for human blood).  Blade is assited by his longtime friend, Whistler (Kristofferson) in his quest to rid the world of Vampires, humans who have certain genetic differences that makes them sensitive to sunlight, garlic and silver and an all powerful thirst for the blood of humans, the one weakness that tortures Blade, since he too has it.  Blade slowly finds that a power hungry Vampire named Frost (the ruthless Stephen Dorrif) is forcing his way through the vampire ranks to become all powerful, i.e. more like Blade.  None of the Vampire weaknesses will apply, and Frost will lead an army of willing vampires to dominate the human race.
The kinetic style of Stephen Norrington is everywhere, as the film moves at a steady pace, smartly slowing down, and speeding up only when it needs to.  And when it does speed up, look out.  Snipes is given ample room to show off his martial arts skills against hordes of Vampires, and Norrington quick camera moves captures them in spectacular fashion.  The headspinning climax of Blade battling Frost is a throat-grabbing tour de force, as can probably be said about the rest of the film.
