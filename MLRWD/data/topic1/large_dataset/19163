Sure, everyone has his/hers favorite TV shows, and preferences shift with seasonal mood, age and experiences. However, THIS IS TELEVISION AT HER BEST!

Atmospheric, mysterious, intriguing, smart,...Words are just not capable to describe this prematurely terminated series! Every time I watch it I discover another moment, another gem I treasure. Too bad it got treated as filler material resulting in its eventual cancellation.

The quality of the second season set is not exactly at par with the first: much less extra material (I was hoping for the spin-off commercials, especially the Japanese ones!). Yet the episodes are beautifully treated: image and sound do them justice.
After all, it is the episodes we bought it for.

Buy it and make weekends out of it. Once in a blue moon a certain magic manifests amongst us. One that never fades.
And there is always music in the air.

How do I know? A gentle giant told me.

PS:
There is now a GOLD EDITION release of both seasons - with all the extras one could desire! My advice: opt for that one.
