The only season of Star Trek Voyager I have not seen is season 7 because it was yanked during season six off of the fox network, and I did not get the channel that picked it up.  I think the original cast in its final whole season together represents the best work of the series.  I think it was a mistake to get rid of Kes(Jennifer Lien) at the beginning of Season 4.  I like the Seven of Nine character, but they could have just as easily gotten rid of Neelix.  I think the Kes character was not only interesting but also just as pretty as any of the Star Trek women in any of the Star Trek series' ever made.  There are absolutely no commentaries (audio or subtitled) on any of the episodes.  The container like all Voyager containers is as cheap as can possibly be imagined.  If it cost them more than $0.10 to make it I would be suprised.  I have no idea why they could not do the same thing they did with the original series.  Those containers are some of the best I have ever seen.  Most good DVDs have commentary from the actors.  I have no idea why they did not do that.  I think Future's End(Part I and II), Scorpion, Unity, Flashback, and Warlord could possibly be some of the best shows of the entire series.
