Kiss Kiss Bang Bang ended up being much more than I originally expected.  An incredible movie to say the least.  Humor, suspense, and a little action for taste.  The movie has all star performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer.

The movie starts off rathe innocently in Indiana as innocence seems all the part.  You may start wondering if you are watching the right movie.  Quickly come in to narrate and essentially telling the story is Robert Downey Jr.  The story tells a rather good tale about three characters.  Downey plays a character named Harry who seems to be trying to find himself as a small time crook nobody.  Kilmer plays a guy who goes by the name of Gay Perry and yes he is gay.  Lastly the rather unknown Michelle Monaghan plays the attractive Harmony who is trying to make it as an actress.

This is about as far as the story gets from where it goes.  The mystery begins quickly and never gets too dark.  What makes the story so good is the great chemistry between these three actors and the comedy that ensues.  Shane Black knows how to make a great mystery with comedy since his name is best known for Lethal Weapon.  There are times where I couldn't stop laughing even during the darkest scenes.  Don't let the fact that there is a lot of humor since the story still is great.

Watching the Blu-ray version was well worth it.  The picture was vibrant and filled with life.  Bringing out most of the scenes the way they were intended to be seen.  The sound was great on my speakers.  An excellent movie for a great price.  Despite the extras lacking.  If you are looking for a wonderful movie that will keep you laughing with a great story then Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a must have to any collection.  This is now one of my favorite movies.
