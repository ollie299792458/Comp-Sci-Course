I love this film on so many levels, but there is a common criticism I tend to see about it which is that the John Lithgow character is useless to the plot.  I strongly disagree because without knowing his part in the story, all we're left with is a lame attempt to rip-off Antonioni's Blow-Up.

Instead, De Palma created an incredibly fun play on irony.  Part of the joy of watching this film is knowing what the protagonists don't know in the last two thirds of the story.  De Palma uses this as a vehicle to explain how exactly a conspiracy could be implemented.  If anyone know's De Palma's feelings on the Kennedy assisanation, they will see just how personal and revealing Blow Out is.  Not just with conspiracy theories, but also in the John Travolta character and his attraction to the nympho-qualities of Nancy Allen.  Personal, powerful, fun, and downright cynical--by far my favorite work from both Travolta and De Palma.

Also worth checking out is Casualties of War, Sisters, Greetings, and Dressed to Kill among many others.
