The Lives of Others is a really interesting story of the lives of artists who dared to dream of freedom, love and happiness under the fascism that existed in East Germany during the 80s. The story follows the life of the Stasi's (their Secret Police) best intel guy. He's charged with finding some damning evidence to destroy a writer, who's wife is sought by a party big-wig.

Little does our hero know that during the course of his mission he will find himself identifying with those he is charged to destroy. He reads their books, listens to their music, and follows the love that they share. Throughout it all he gains several opportunities to complete his mission, but he finds himself unable to. He cares about these people, and the climax at the end demonstrates his commitment to his conscience.

Overall its a powerful film, stunningly emotional, and very real. It harkens a dark future for those of us in the United States, as well as Britain - where surveillence of the populace has become the norm. Warrantless Wiretapping, Secret Courts and Concentration camps have become 'necessary' in the 'war on terror'. All these items and countless others - have the classic sign of fascism, and this film may give us an idea what our future holds if we don't Wake Up.
