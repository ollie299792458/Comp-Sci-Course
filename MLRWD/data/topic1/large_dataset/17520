The Disney WOW 2 disc set IS a good piece of equipment for adjusting and optimizing a plasma/LCD HD TV.
It is NOT much more functional than other simpler optimization discs that are less expensive.
The small differences in the viewed picture quality attained with this set of discs are noticeable over the others but not by much.
The additional disc in the package has quality displays of Blu-ray material but it's all stills no real (tests) for motion, jaggies, or artifacts.
There are pieces of Disney animated movie samples but no (real) movie samples with real humans with skin tone closeups or action scenes samples.
The onscreen directions are easy to follow. They are arranged in the correct and logical sequence.
The REAL benefit comes in the instruction manual. It gives a full explanation of the range of test screens and their purpose.
Everyone who has a HD TV should have a test and optimization disc IF you're interested in getting your money's worth out of the
HD TV's ability to reproduce excellent color and details.
 I've seen friends and relatives TVs that were maladjusted out of the box. It's amazing how little picture quality people will put up with and still think they're getting and watching the best available picture.
