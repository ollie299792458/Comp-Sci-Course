The aspect ratio is fake.

The top and bottom of the regular full screen version has been cropped out of the picture to give the illusion your getting a widescreen - what your getting is less picture!

The studios should label the DVD's as they did when they cropped VHS video picture " this film has been modified to fit you tv screen" as in modified to fit a 16x9 tv in this case.

You have already lost one third of the picture when it was modified to full screen, now you loose an additional one third to one fourth of the movies image!

The reason leterbox and widescreen has a demand, is that the audience or consumer wants to view the Movie as it was filmed and framed by the filmaker, and not loose out on portions of the movie that the director intended.

In other words the idea to release in widescreen was for the intention of showing MORE not LESS of the movies image.

The studios believe they can get away with this, since the average buyer does not have a full screen video version to compare with, or the consumer is just unaware.

I compared this DVD to a full screen VHS version, and in many cases where some DVD's come with both Full & Wide Screen on a flip disc, compare them before watching, many of the widesreen sides are just chopped versions of the full screen.

The picture quality is great on this and most DVD's, it is unfortunate though that it has to be a conciliation for cropped picture.
