This is one of my favorite movies of all time! It is a beautiful story that is enjoyable for all ages, kids and adults alike. I am extremely impressed with its breathtaking landscapes and its brilliant acting. This movie far surpasses its two successors in both quality and content. Despite the obviously fantastic nature of the story, the viewer can easily become engaged in the story, and find that they believe every moment. Viewers will find that they, too, are part of The NeverEnding Story.
I have read the original German book, and I find the movie to be a very good adaptation of the parts of the book the movie covers. Although the book has MUCH more than the movie, the parts that the movie uses have been recreated on screen very well. There are only one or two major differences between the movie and the book, along with a few minor differences. Of course, such things can't be avoided when adapting a book into a screenplay.
I highly recommend this movie to everyone! I also recommend that anyone who likes the movie read the book. I have never read the translated edition, but the original German is fabulous!
