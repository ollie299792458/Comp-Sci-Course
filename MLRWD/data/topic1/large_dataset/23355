I'm a big Hitchcock fan, and "Marnie" is my favorite Hitchcock movie. I like Tippie Hedren. She is the typical cold, blonde heroine that Hitchcock favored, but my, what subtext! As an actress, it's what you want to achieve, especially on screen: the sense that there is much going on under the surface that is never vocalized. The scene that the other reviewers talk about in their reviews--the gas explosion with the flashes of Tippie's face, for example--are kind of campy now, but even through the campiness there is a sense of unease. There are many scenes in this movie that are just gems of tension and subtext. The scenes between Tippie and the mother, between Tippie and Suzanne Pleshette: the actresses and the screenwriters don't make the obvious choices and that's part of what makes these movies so fun to watch again and again. The scene with the woman birder in the cafe is very enjoyable. The minor characters in these old movies have major impact. While not a great movie, it is worth having in your collection if you enjoy tension, great acting and writing, and a few giggles at the melodrama.
