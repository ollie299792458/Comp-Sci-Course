I literally just finished watching this DVD minutes ago.  I wasn't expecting much, but "The Score" was definitely an entertaining film.  Just to clear up a couple of things, there definitely ARE surprises, contrary to what the editorial review says- I guarantee you'll crack a smile during the ending of this movie.  And for some reason, a previous review labeled the ending as a "shootout", which couldn't be farther from the truth.  Part of whst makes this movie stand out as above average is that it does't result to the cliche' ending that one might expect.  And that, in itself, is a surprise.  
The only real dissapointment was that the interaction between the "big 3" wasn't quite as magical as I had anticipated.  Not that any of the 3 were at all bad, but we've seen them do so much more in the past. The high point is an exchange between Brando and De Niro in which Brando begs for De Niro's cooperation.  Norton gives a quality performance, but it's nowhere near the standard he set with "Primal Fear", "Rounders", or "American History X".  
If nothing else, watch "The Score" just for a chance to see 3 of the greatest actors alive (albeit not in their greatest performances). Oceans Eleven has nothing on this cast!
