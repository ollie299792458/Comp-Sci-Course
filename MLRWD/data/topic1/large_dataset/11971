Big question for the second installment, of Scary Movie, which, I might add, part one- I loved...how long did it take them to write this?  A half hour?  If it took longer than that, I was fooled.  It is amazing how horrible a comedy can be, and I think this one might just take the award for the worst ever.  Unlike part 1, there was no coherent story.  Granted, the plot in part one wasn't totally solid, but in part 2- it wasn't there at all.  It seemed more like a series of skits that made no sense together, and none of them were funny at that.  The same old jokes used in the same exact way.  Some of the jokes in this movie were IDENTICAL to the jokes in part one...the "sex" scene being one of those.  Same fire hose like spray of liquid knocking the very annoying Faris down.  That's another thing...if that girl wasn't annoying in the first, in this one- she is so annoying you just want someone to strangle her to get her out of the movie.  I am very disappointed in the writers and everyone involved in making the film, because it seems like they thought they had to automatically make a part 2 to make some more cash, and they clearly thought it had to be made, edited, and released within a few days...that's what it looks like.  This is a horrible mess that has maybe 2 funny jokes, and the rest is just gross out humor...unlike the first, this gross out humor is not funny, just gross.  Miss this one at all costs.  1/10
