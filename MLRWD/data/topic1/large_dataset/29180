You know, the hit-and-run, the cheating, the same "fate" theme, the same pursuit for redemption and happiness...  I'm not saying that Inarritu ripped this off, but I'm guessing he must have seen "13 Conversations".  And actually, from having watched each film only once (and "13" not even all the way from the beginning), I find Jill Sprecher's work more impressive.  Perhaps my expectations were too high for 21 Grams, but I found certain plot pieces strained and pushing the credibility envelope.  Case in point: why would Benecio Del Torro's "born again" status not have made him stop and help these people he ran over - if he'd been scared, the director owes us a an account of his state of mind at the time, but there wasn't even an attempt to do this.  The chronological jumping around in 21 Grams was more gimmicky than artistic.  The final scene with the voice over was particularly dissatisfying.  By comparison, 13 Conversations felt much more purposeful and confident.  Incredible acting talent in both films (good to see Melissa Leo working again after Homicide) - I just found them used better in one movie than the other.  Would be interested in other takes on this comparison...
