I think Holes is one of the best family-friendly movies that I've seen in the past few years. In the age of questionable jokes working their ways into family-marketed movies, I think any parent with a child over the age of 7 could feel comfortable with their kids watching this movie, as well as enjoy it themselves. It addresses issues such as greed and bigotry and rehabilitation of those deemed "hopeless" and the true meaning of friendship

and perserverance without being preachy and too "after-school-special." I think adults can enjoy this movie alot, too- there's something timeless to the heart of this movie.

I personally enjoyed the pacing and how the flashbacks were done. A lot of movies get mired up in flashbacks, the flashbacks go on too long, tell too much story, but Louis Sacher did a great job with weaving the 3 different stories into one. I loved that the script was serious, but still funny. The humor was cute and subtle and the characters were very three-demensional and all very dynamic, even the villians.

I especially enjoyed seeing Eartha Kitt playing Madame Zironi. I thought she was a great addition to the cast with her character. Another thing that I felt was a character in itself was the lake. It was this beautiful, bustling little city in Texas that turned into a dry wasteland after a horrible act of greed, jealousy and hatred destroyed lives.

I first read Louis Sacher books when I was 7-8 years old,and they were quite funny, but difficult for me. I hadn't picked up any of them since. I saw this movie about a year ago and I am quite impressed with Mr Sachar, now.

Bravo!
