Wow, for those who say the movie lacks depth or emotion are you ever wrong!  I thought this would be the perfect movie to psycho-analyze in my Women's Studies classes.  You have a young woman, Leila, who has sex because she seems to think the thrill of turning men on and pleasing them is what she wants.  But she really yearns for a relationship that she can derive pleasure from -- sexually & emotionally (she doesn't get that last part until later).  As a result, we often see her masturbating, and toward the end, forcing a guy to please her sexually in order to fulfill that need for pleasure.  But she's never satisfied (because she's not fulfilling the emotional cavity).  Then she meets David.  When he sees her, he is immediately attracted to her sexually, and they hook up based on that.  Thus, Leila continues to use sex as her means of connecting.  But, something is different with this guy.  Not only does she enjoy sex with him (not just pleasuring him), she starts to feel an emotional connection seeing him care for his Dad.  She doesn't know what to do with these feelings.  All she knows how to do is "f---."  So when David needs her most, she leaves him.  And though he was initially attracted to her based on sex, he wants more.  When he realizes she can't/won't give it to him, he gets angry and doesn't take her back.  Leila realizes sex alone is not satisfying; she needs David as a true companion.  David realizes he loves Leila, and desperately wants to learn who she is.  In the end, he tracks her down and sees her among family & religious tradition -- a very personal side of her.  She runs away, scared to let him see that same vulnerability he had shown her (it always seemed easy just to f---). But David refuses to let her go, and we realize these two are going to be okay.  And, yes, this movie was incredibly sexy -- I saw it on cable while in Mexico and, wow, did it make for some great lovin'!
