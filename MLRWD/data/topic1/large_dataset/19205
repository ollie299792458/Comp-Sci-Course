It's so wonderful that "The Adventures of Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn was given such great dvd treatment.  The copy is excellent. Very clear and bright picture, like seeing the film for the first time.  Plus this two-disc set has plenty of extra features, interviews and documentaries. This is a must have for classic movie fans and Errol Flynn fans alike.  It's a beautiful film , full of adventure  and romance.  Errol Flynn is the definitive Robin Hood, he looks like the real one from the books and acts the part to supreme excellence.  I think Olivia D'Havilland is also the perfect Maid Marian, beautiful, wise, and also kind of shy and fragile as well.

All the supporting cast is excellent as well, Alan Hale and the rest play their roles to perfection and are great as Robin Hood's devoted Merry Men. Basil Rathbone plays Sir Guy to perfection he's really believable as the villen and Claude Rains I think does and equally wonderful job as Prince John.  A really evil but likeable villen.

It has excellent acting , tons of adventure, and great sword fighting and archery scenes.  For new viewers of this film , the color will really impress them, with the lovely forest scenes and beautiful costuming. The archery contest alone is colorful and really impressive.

This film is definitly first rate and watching it each time is just as exciting as the first.  It's always very interesting and action packed.  I also would like to point out besides the action and adventure the romance between Robin and Marian is very nice too and their are some beautiful  and touching scenes between them.  As in all their films Miss D'Havilland and Errol Flynn really make a believable couple and lovely couple who look very much in love.

In my opinion no one can play Robin Hood like Errol Flynn.
