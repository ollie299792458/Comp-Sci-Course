I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie...well over 200, no exaggeration. But this is the absolute best - I can't imagine it could be any better than this! The box set really adds an element of fun to the experience, with the books and the postcards and the music box. My ONLY complaint is that the 45th anniversary soundtrack that comes in this box set is not the same one that you can buy at Amazon. So even after spending $60 on this boxed set, I still went ahead and spent the additional $10 for the entire 25-track soundtrack (which is completely remastered and AWESOME). If you're going to buy the additional soundtrack, just buy the downloadable one, which has one track more than the CD that you have to wait to be delivered.

Make sure you watch all of the special features on disc 2. So much work was put into remastering this edition of the movie, and it was all well worth it. The final product is so absolutely breathtaking. And it really adds an element of depth when you watch it in surround. ENJOY!
