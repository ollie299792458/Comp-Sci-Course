The first time I watched The Sand Pebbles it was on a premium cable station between channel flipping.  I never really gave the movie much thought because I was under the impression that it was just a B-rated romance.  Wow I was totally mistaken.  Being a war movie buff, I have seen many of the great war films and The Sand Pebbles stands up there as one of the finest.  From the very beginning the action draws the viewer into the intrigue of a navy vessel caught on the Yangtse River in China during the middle 1920s.  Steve McQueen is suberb as Holman the chief engineer of the San Pablo. His portrayal of a veteren seaman who has lost his humanity and wins it back through the love of a missonary, played by Candance Bergen, is incredibly moving.  Director Robert Wise also enlists great performances from Richard Crenna, Richard Attenborough and Mako.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in the history of China and the United States. The Sand Pebbles brings this history vividly to life.  I also highly recommend the video, which I rented shortly after watching it on cable. This movie prompts multi-viewing to fully enjoy the high drama.
