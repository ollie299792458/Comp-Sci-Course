Two words summarize this film - mindless fun.  Yes, I said it.  If you are looking for a deep movie experience, you are looking at the wrong film.  However, if you are  a) Looking for a fun film to kill ~2 hours, or b) an avid Kate Hudson fan, then this film won't dissapoint you that much.  Although their performances could have been better (such as in How to Lose a Guy), which might be attributed to a somewhat lacking script - Kate and Mat still manage to deliver that same chemistry they seem to exude with each other.

Now, the transfer itself - I found it to be pretty good overall.  Some of the ocean scenes look absolutely beautiful in BD, the sound is solid, and the transfer is pretty clean (no spots, not a lot of grain).  If anything, maybe the colors are a bit too saturated in some places, but in a film of this type, it works for it, rather than against it.

So, do you buy it or not?  It depends.  If you want fun, and have the money to spend, sure, why not.  If you are one of those discriminating people who only buy the best movies out there, then maybe this movie is not for you.
