I haven't read the actual novel in years, but my roommate sat me down and had me watch this movie (I believe the words "Shirtless Kenneth Branagh" were heavily stressed) at about 2:30 the other morning, and I was blown away. It sticks closer to the novel than other versions, as far as I can remember, and while Kenneth Branagh's performance, as amazing as it was, didn't seem up to his usual intensity the two other lead actors blew me away. Robert De Niro was so adept at portraying the pathos and later sinister threat of the Creature that I forgot this was the same man I saw in "Meet the Parents" a week ago. :) And Helena Bonham Carter, always one of my favorite actresses, is responsible for carrying the last twenty minutes of the film. Purists be warned, there's a serious deviation in these last twenty minutes; but to me, it seemed to add to the story, not detract. However, they're worth watching just to see some absolutely AMAZING acting. All the horror and humanity in the story comes to a brutal, beautiful climax. This is a film that will stay with you.
