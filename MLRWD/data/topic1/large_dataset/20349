First off I want to say I absolutely hate exercising, so I suppose that is why at age 47, I was so totally out of shape, couldn't breathe, and hurt all the time. I knew I had to do something, and since I had never tried yoga before, I thought I would give it a shot. After reading tons of reviews, I settled on this 3 dvd collection. What convinced me was the words "For inflexible people" - that was me, totally inflexible. The first day I barely made it through the 5 minute warm up, but I persevered, and now, after just 4 short weeks, I do a 50 minute workout, have lost 4 pounds and 2 inches off of my waist, I feel a lot more energetic (as opposed to the zero energy I had before), my back feels great!!!, my headaches are almost completely gone, and I have been getting the best sleep I have had in years. I am a complete convert to yoga. The dvd "Yoga For Stress Relief" is my favorite because it lets you target real problem areas which for me is my lower back and hips. I am amazed at how much good these poses can do a person in such a short amount of time. I just wish I had started doing yoga years ago. Hope this helps you decide which you want to buy.
