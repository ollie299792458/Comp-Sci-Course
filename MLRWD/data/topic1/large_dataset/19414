I am not a big Elton fan, although I have enjoyed some of his music over the years. I am very much into blu-ray high def and love the dazzling sights and sounds of this technology. I recently came across this disc and knew I wanted to see it. My wife, who is a much bigger fan of Elton John than I am, immediately wanted to purchase this. I was not at all disappointed by this concert, and in fact, I must say, that it gave incredible new life to songs that are many years old. The concert was long, over three hours, but it actually was an incredible amount of fun to see and hear. The music itself was varied and fantastic. The high def picture and sound of this blu ray edition was nothing short of amazing. I watched it on an LG BH200 hi def player, which is connected to a Toshiba 42 in 1080p LCD television. My wife and I were both blown away by the dazzling crisp, clear, razor-sharp images of the video and the 5.1 DD surround sound. I could not be happier with the performance and it is certainly the next best thing to being at this concert in person. Happy 60th birthday Elton and THANK YOU for a most enjoyable concert!
