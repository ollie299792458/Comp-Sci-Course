The Quiet Earth is one of the great sci-fi movies of all time. It doesn't have the best special effects or even the best acting of all time but it moves to the top of the list in my book because of it's thought-provoking and haunting themes.

This movie isn't just about the "last man on Earth", it is about lonliness and reflecting the nature of man. Untimately, Zac Hobson goes on a journey of self-exploration. I don't know about other reviewers but that theme really hit the mark with me when I watched this film. I think that alot of people feel that they are on the "Quiet Earth" everyday of their lives and long to make connections with other people and explore who they are. Zac goes from being lonely, tortured and ultimately suicidal to being "cleansed" of his demons (hence the naked ocean scene) and sacrificing his life for others.

The ending is great and definately provides a forum for further discussion. I think the writer and director purposefully left it ambiguous so that you could take what you will from the film.
