I read Ghost Soldiers, am a war movie junkie and my wife's parents are Filipinos born and raised in the Philippines. I came to this movie with the highest hopes, but was sorely disappointed. Where to begin? First, the screenplay was absolutely horrible. The writers crammed every war movie cliche into the script. And, as in many recent vintage war films (see Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates), the writers felt compelled to insert a contrived romance into the movie that killed the flow of the film. Finally, the acting was just horrible. Benjamin Bratt was totally unconvincing in the "John Wayne role." It is possible to make an ensemble war movie without a bunch of pretty boy actors masquerading as soldiers (see Band of Brothers).  James Franco especially bad. It was almost as though he was doing an Elvis impersination and totally lacked the gravitas his role required. On the plus side, the film did strive for historical accuracy. But the lack of attention to details was glaring. E.g., considering that the Army Rangers were crawling through the jungle for three days, by the 3rd day all were clean shaven and their clothes were still clean. And for prisoners that had been starved and beaten for three years, many of them looked like they just stepped out of the gym. A real letdown.
