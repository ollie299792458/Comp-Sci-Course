It has been so long since we watched a movie that had nothing objectional in it.  Kudos to all involved with the creation of this movie!  We can truly let our children watch "Facing the Giants" and not be concerned. At the same time it offers several opportunities to open up conversations with your children.  There is: *no sex *no swearing *no immorality *no innuendo *no unnecessary violence *no immodesty.  There are people you can believe with real, everyday problems.  They show life the way it is - you have to work through your problems and face them head on.

There is one situation where one of the players is overtly disrespectful to his father.  The scene is necessary to the movie and is handled very well.  It is not just thrown in there because it's "how kids are".  The resolution comes later in the movie and is to be commended.

For a cast and crew of volunteers this movie can't be beat!  Buy one for yourself and several to give away and look forward to a wonderful evening with your preteen and teenaged children.

Not sure why it's rated PG.  We've been offended by many G rated movies, animated and not, that have unnecessary innuendo and inappropriate behaviors in them.  Facing the Giants is a family-acceptable movie.
