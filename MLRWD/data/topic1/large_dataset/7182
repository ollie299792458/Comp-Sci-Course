This film is what Film Noir is all about. The plot is perfect; doomed
anti-hero faces fate, bad guys who are a step ahead of him at every turn, time running out and love just out of reach.
  Everyman, Frank Bigelow, finds himself a "dead man walking", with two
days or about a week to live. The poisen that is killing him is as much a
mystery as the twist of fate that has made him worth murdering.
  The opening makes this film a noir classic, Bigelow shows up at the
homicide department to report his own murder and the story takes off from
here, maintaining a torrid pace until the final scene.
  This is a dark, complex tale that manages to make you suspect every-
one and know that there is a new twist around every corner. Each charactor
we meet has a story to tell that is not quite true.
  Exquisite lighting, sound track and framing set the mood for the most
part except for the bizarre wolf whistles that accompany the appearance of
every beautiful woman he sees in San Francisco while he is out to have a
wild time away from his girlfriend, Paula. This part of the soundtrack is an off the mark distraction opposed to an otherwise nearly perfect acoust-
ic mirror for the action.
  The taught fast moving story line provides enough twists and turns to lose the viewer who does not pay close attention.
  Like most films of the genre, it relies heavily on dialogue to keep
up the pace. D.O.A. adds plenty of action to move this nifty litle film a-
long at a speed that make it's eighty-three minutes simply fly by.
  Lively performances by Edmond O'Brien, Pamela Britton and a brief but intense and spellbinding performance by Neville Brand push this Noir
thriller into the must own, Noir Classique realm.
  It has a dark finis' that entertains us even though fate deals our
anti-hero one bum hand after another. At last he sees love has been near
at hand but time has run out.
  This is a "must have" for all real Noir fans.
