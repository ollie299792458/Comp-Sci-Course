Calling Showgirls "poorly acted" or "sexist" completely misses the point; it's like accusing Britney Spears of not being  a "real musician," as though you've discovered something.
Of  *course* Showgirls is exploitative and demeaning to women.  Almost all  Hollywood movies are demeaning to women.  Almost all of them are  male-written, male-directed male fantasies. But most of them cover this  fact with a thin veneer of "empowerment" and  "sensitivity," making perfunctory, surface concessions to  political correctness.  It's hypocritical, dishonest and has horrible  long-term effects on the psyches of young impressionable girls (and boys).  The brilliance of Showgirls is that it gathers all of the worst Hollywood  masculine excess and throws it unapologetically in our faces. The movie is  straight-from-the-id, primal, brutish male fantasy.  Every woman in the  movie is a laughable caricature who advances, if at all, by deceiving other  women and becoming a sexual object for men.  The "heroine," Nomi,  crosses every line, sells every shred of dignity, physically assaults her  female competitors, sleeps with her boss (in the most over-the-top sex  scene in cinematic history), gets her best friend raped... and at the end  of the film, claims that she has gambled and won "herself."  This  tragi-comic nod to empowerment is a slap to the face of anyone who's been  paying attention.
Whether Esterhauz and Verhoeven intended it as such,  Showgirls is at once a camp classic and a sly satire, an example of  everything our culture at once wallows in and disavows.  Sure, you can  react with righteous indignation, waggle your finger at the movie, and pat  yourself on the back for being so enlightened.  But maybe you should take a  look around, at the billboards, the commercials, the sitcoms, the movies,  the music videos, your own prejudices... and think about whether you can't  find a better target.
