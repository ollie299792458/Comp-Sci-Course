You really have to watch this movie with the precept that the bad guys forgot just one little detail...Bruce Friggin' Willis! You can just hear them saying under their breath every time he does something to throw them off their task or screw up their plans...'d'oh!' with a German accent of course.  And, thank God  that, though it was cut from the movie, the DVD special feature's outakes introduces us to the love scene Bruce has with his own ego after the cast rap party.  Really folks, it's entertaining, but good god, could the good guys and the bad guys be any less subltly defined?  I was waiting for Hans, the head bad guy to put on his Snidley Whiplash hat, twist his pointy moustache and yell; '...nyah ah ah!'  And what is it with the walkie-talkies?  Are we to believe clever international criminals are stupid enough to use such easily-monitored devices?  Apparently audiences are thought to be so dense the director thought they wouldn't 'get' all the action and plot line unless everyone was on the same page using a common communication device.  When it's all said and done, this movie is the modern day equivalent to a Roy Rogers western...complete with the 'yippee-i-o-ky-yay!' and the obligatory ride into the sunset.  Of course a sequel was inevitable...but the formula was the same...same plot, same protagonist, different venue.  I can just see the director now...'yeah that's it...instead of a big building, we'll do it in an airport!'  Oh it's a good movie, and it's okay to watch, but suspend disbelief and put your brain in the closet...you won't need it.  For this one, the second one and the third.
