...more people like John Lennon!  When I became aware this film was available on DVD here on Amazon, I went whoopie...now I have a place where I can express my emotions for John.  He was far more than my favorite Beatle.  I looked at him as a kindred brother.  Even though I never met the man in person, I felt I met him through his music.  It's as if his words became my own.  Perhaps not everything, but nearly everything I ever said or did was directly because of his influence.  When Chapman shot him down all those years ago now, part of me died too...and I can honestly say I have not been the same since.  But Chapman did nothing but immortalize John.  I'm sure John himself would allow Chapman to go free today knowing John's love for people.  But this documentary doesn't only shed light on John, but John's life with the Beatles.  And what better man to shed light on the Beatles but the group's founder?  I do feel this is the best documentary ever done about the Beatles.  It's loaded with rare insights.  I love when John says "When I was with the Beatles, I thought we were the best  group in the whole  world.  Believing that we were is what made us what we were..."  I also love the bed-in scenes and John's defense when he returned his MBE.  He truly lived up to his words when he wrote "Imagine no possessions..."  Who else but John would do something like giving up medals as a testament for peace???  I especially love the later scenes with John & his family.  He could finally be John the man and not John the ex-Beatle, even though that tag has regretfully stuck with all of them.  My favorite scene is the slow motion shot of John's glasses flying off his head and shattering on the ground.  That really symbolized the end of it all...the dream really was over...no more Beatles, no more John.  If you really want to experience it all in a unique way, see this film.  It's the next best thing to having John there with you....in the end, all you really need is Imagine.
