Don't be a Vork, Support The Guild by purchasing the dvd's!

Sure you can get the episodes for free, but hey that's just what Vork would do. So bring cheese to your burger joint and save up your loot from cheese gouging to invest in these quality dvds. Splurge on your expense budget! :)

Kidding aside, this is an excellent show but I do suggest watching a few webisodes to see if you enjoy it first. It's probably not for every human on the planet, it's definitely for all Role-Playing Gamers, and maybe even for those casual gamers... Even beyond that niche, I bet anyone will find it humorous even if you don't get all the lingo at first. If you're not a gamer, give it a shot anyway you may just be pleasantly surprised!

The DVDs offer a great deal of extras and have two alternate audio tracks with commentary, along with an easteregg! I usually skip all the "making of" and commentary b/c I find them boring, however I surprisingly enjoyed The Guild's extras.

So Don't be a Vork, Support!
