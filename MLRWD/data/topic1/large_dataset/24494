All the reasons why I so loved this movie are yet unclear to me. At times I think I loved it for very simple reasons, then other times I think I loved it for more profound reasons. In the end, it doesn't seem to matter, but it is certainly a movie that found its way to the heart of a woman who only remembers a very few out of probably hundreds of movies I've seen.  This is one I will remember.
I love Victor, the main character --- his insecurities, his fears, his honesty, and the way he ultimately wants to make himself vulnerable to the young girl he seeks, known as "Juicy Judy". I am intrigued by the way their relationship unfolds, the obstacles they face, the advice their friends give on the relationship.  I enjoy the way I see the tearing down of emotional walls, the coming to terms with one's own needs and desires, the importance and necessity of family.  I thought of  the characters long after the movie was returned to the video store. This movie is so much more than what I expected.  The acting is just beyond superb, and every situation in this film is so absolutely believable, you'll remember the days of your adolescence with sweet fondness. This is one of the most honest films I have seen in a long, long time.
