The 20th and most fantastic movie to enter the series in a long time! Packed with evil villians, sexy girls, gadgets galore and the classic one-liners from the most famous spy of all time- it doesn't get any better than that. First the villians- Gustav Graves is a snotty, arrogant and show-off to the public and is bent on world domination with his super weapon- the Icarus. He duels 007 with fencing swords and lives in style in his Ice palace in Iceland. Zao is the henchmen who is scarred with diamond shrapnel and has a personal goal to kill 007. And, finally is my favorite character in the movie- the stunning Miranda Frost! She is the athletic, cunning, mysterious, extremely sexy ice princess that gives Bond the ice treatment in her regard to her extreme hate of him. a world-class fencer, and collaborator with Gustav, she battles with Jinx aboard the Antonov plane, and ultimately meets her end. (Darn!, I really liked her, She really is hot!) The other main Bond girl is Jinx, who works as a team with Bond, and battles along with him. David Arnold gives his finest perfromance, with his best 007 soundtrack ever! Madonna gives the most different, but one of the best title songs ever also.
This film has many references to the past because of the 40th anniversary of the films. Here are a few---
-look for 007 holding the book Birds Of The West Indies by James Bond.
-007 steals a grape a la` Thunderball
-the WWII cigarettes poster that Domino loved from Thunderball
-Duke of Wellington statue in teaser a la` like the picture in Dr. No
-fencing club called Blades, like the gentlemen's club in many 007 books
-Jinx entry like Honey Ryder in Dr. No
-MANY past gadgets in Q's lab from past Bond films.
-Q's quip to 007, "Here's your new watch, this will be your 20th I believe." Ha Ha Ha.
Also be on the lookout for the classic cameo of Michael G. Wilson in the film as General Chandler. Madonna also does a cameo as fencing instructer Verity in the Blades Club.
A long awaited film, that I have had the pleasure of seeing, and GOD! it is one of the best in the series!!!
