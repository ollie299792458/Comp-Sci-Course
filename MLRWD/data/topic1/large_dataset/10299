Wow!  What a great high seas adventure.  Countless times retold and in as many ways, The Bounty is the ultimate portrayal of life aboard the Armed Vessel Bounty.  An all-star cast, including Anthony Hopkins, Mel Gibson, Liam Neeson and Sir Lawrence Olivier navigate this film through it's stormy storyline of loyalty lost and mutiny found.

Mel Gibson brings a career-best performance as British Naval Officer Fletcher Christian, who has agreed to sail to Tahiti aboard The Bounty under the command of Lt. William Bligh (Hopkins).  Their friendship comes undone as Bligh becomes increasingly intolerant of his crew's behavior while at port in Tahiti.  Christian leads a mutiny and sets Bligh adrift.  In spite of starvation, thirst and bad sunburn, Bligh demonstates his naval supremacy by sailing his dinghy to a French port, thereby saving himself and the few men who would not mutiny.  Christian eventually contends with a near-mutinous crew of his own before finding Pitcairns Island, his final port-of-call before his uncertain demise.

Let me just say that the cinematography of this movie is magical.  The scenes at sea and in Tahiti are absolutely beautiful.  Hopkins plays convincingly as an over-achieving, demanding ship's Captain.  And, contrary to a couple of reviewers, I absolutely loved the musical score by Vangelis.  It provided a hauntingly mesmerising theme to the adventure and danger of crossing vast seas in the 1700's.

Well worth watching, this film, 20+years old, is still one of the best naval-themed movies ever.  I found it more exciting than Master and Commander.  And, the fact it's based on a true story makes it even more irresistable.  4+stars.
