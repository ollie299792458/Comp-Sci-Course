These books were so gripping and entertaining, I was really excited to see that the Swedish version of the movies was available and ordered the set of movies with my last book of the series. As both my husband and I had read the first two books at this point, we watched the first two movies while reading the last book. What a major disappointment that whole story lines were omitted and events changed, presumably to accommodate the reduced time necessary for a movie. The casting was another let-down. Noomi Rapace, to me, was wooden and sullen, though I found many more emotions in Lisbeth Salander's character. The whole thing was apparently produced with a budget for a made-for-tv movie, so out of the country scenes were eliminated or ignored.
I would have been much happier watching the movies if I hadn't read and had no intention of reading the books. I also would have sat through a mini-series based on each book that followed the storyline more faithfully. We are fans of foreign films and routinely watch sub-titled films, but did opt for the dubbed version with the last two of the series. Ordinarily I would expect the Swedish version to be truer to the subject matter, but now will see at least the American version of 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' to see it they've done it better.
