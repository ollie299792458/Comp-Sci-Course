You do not have to be a Christian to enjoy this DVD!!!

If you do not own this DVD, and you love music, inspiring performances, or just well made movies, you are missing out!  After many years of not owning a copy of this film, I purchased a copy of this DVD. I was amazed at how great this film was, and is!!  You will find inspiring performances, excellent cinematography, and an excellent commentary from Ted Neeley (the star).  The vocals and arrangements are amazing, and stood the test of time.  This material is still fresh, still thought provoking.  The performances are still awe inspiring.  Anyone who enjoys incomparible vocal performances should not miss this DVD.  Buy it, play it, wear it out, and buy another one!!  The vocal performances of Ted Neeley as Jesus Christ and Carl Anderson as Judas are especially noteworthy, although there is not one mediocre performance in this entire film.  The quality of the reproduction seems as good as you could expect, and the sound is very good as well.  Well worth the investment, for parents and children alike.
