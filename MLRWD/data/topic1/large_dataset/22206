Okay, for starters, i know this film (which has gone largely-marketed) looks like at-a-glance a weird fantasy flick, but let me tell you: This movie is absolutely fantastic. This movie is everything "A series of unfortunate events" tried to be (although the plot is nothing similar). This movie should have been one of the top movies of '08, if it wasn't for the whole "oh, we're not going to spend any marketing dollars on this" decision. In other words, SEE THIS MOVIE.

Why, do you ask?  Well first of all, if your looking for another no-brain, run-of-the-mill, big studio flick (think: any buddy cop movie), this movie is not for you.  Otherwise, You'll love it. This movie has it all: It is set in a place that brings not only wonder, but make you think... it has an antagonist that goes from bumbling to evil so artfully (really, the way only Murray can), it has the two young protagonists that you cant help but root for the whole way, it is chock with witty and sharp dialogue, and more then anything, its a movie that inspires emotion. Within the last 20 minutes, you _want_ them to win. You want to see the happy ending, and in the end, what more can you ask of any movie?

P.S.: Fun (and appropriate) for kids, but definitely not a "Kids" movie. This movie is a "must-see" no matter who you are, but the younger ones may not get the message behind the story. Just FYI.
