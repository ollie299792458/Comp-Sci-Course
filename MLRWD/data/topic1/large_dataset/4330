This is by far the best western i have ever seen and one of the best overall films i have seen. Redford and Newman are amazing as the comedic outlaws that have left a mark in the history of westerns. Katherine Ross is delightful as the Sundances' girlfriend and a soulmate to them both.
  This film consists of all things that make a good movie it has a wonderful story, strong characters to back it up, and the cast that makes it all work. I only wish movies were still made like this where acting and character strength was the foundation as opposed to special effects which take away from a story. It has all the compelling aspects of film and emotion from action to romance and it even squeezes in a significant amount of humor. A film that everyone,any age, will love.
  I love the way Redford and Newman feed lines off one another, their chemistry is amazing. It was the beginning to one of the most charming and humorous hollywood duos. You finish watching the film and you find yourself qouting some of the funniest scenes with newman and redford.
  It is a movie that consists of beatiful art direction, and cinematography and the costume designing was in itself superb.
i am twenty four and i love this film, it is a film that will be loved for many years to come. i would recommend it to anyone who wants to see two of the greatest actors ever and one of the best films ever.
