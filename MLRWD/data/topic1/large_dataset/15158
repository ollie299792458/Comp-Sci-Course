THE OMEN is a truly effective horror film.  It is one of the best of the seventies.  It may not be as psychologically intense as ROSEMARY'S BABY or religiously disturbing as THE EXORCIST, but it is a wonderful, quiet, and subtly moving story of a caring family torn apart by a terrifying revelation.  Gregory Peck plays the US Ambassador who's wife gave birth to a stillborn.  Not wanting to break the news to his wife, the hospital offers him the baby of a woman who died after giving birth, a woman who has no living relatives.  He accepts and the family live happily until his son, Damien's, fifth birthday, in which the revelation of the antichrist is carried out.  The cast is wonderful, adding to the realism and effectiveness of the film.  You really feel the Thorns being torn apart by the events that occur, yet still reluctant to believe their son, the child they have been waiting for all their lives, to be the antichrist.  Gregory Peck is very good, and gives the film a sense of respectability, and not just a 70's devil film.  The talented Lee Remick contributes to the story well, making us especially sympathetic for this unfortunate character.  Remick and the whole casts expressions of horrors leave an imprint in your mind for a long time.  David Warner plays the curious photographer. The devil is one of the most horrifying evils of the horror film, and this film really takes this subject seriously, thus making the film a more believable movie.  Also, this classic movie is completely entertaining.  It has some gore for the gore lovers, but also uses it very carefully for those who don't enjoy bloodfests.  It is creepy, eerie, and even a bit campy for those who like that sort of thing.  Last, but not least, Jerry Goldsmith's Academy Award-winning score (the heart-stopping "Ave Satani") is a major part of this horror movie.  This drama/horror is creative, scary, entertaining, and moving at the same time.
