I think the writing of this film was done so whilst tripping on a bad batch of opium and countless other drugs that make complete idiocy seem hysterical.  This flick was comically dead below the waist.(Just like the ventriloquist dummy Winona Ryder has sex with in one of the stories- I mean, Come ON!  If they couldn't make you laugh while watching a beloved 80's star mock-buck a wooden doll how could it possibly claim comedic status?  The other reviews are true- this movie is BORING. Some of the "stories" COULD HAVE BEEN FUNNY if the actors had been directed to act as though they knew they were being stupid and therefore give a wink to the ridiculousness that is this film and invite the viewers to play along. But the acting is done in as serious a manner as over-the-top parody acting can be. It really just leaves the poor souls who watch it saying WTF. I found myself going against THE TEN, saying Oh God, how many more are there, everytime a story ended and we came back to Paul to introduce us to the next commandment. If you weren't religiously inclined previous to this movie I will say it definitely leaves you praying- for it to be over.

I chuckled briefly a FEW times while watching Paul Rudd during his narrator bits...but only because I think he's sexy and I often wonder what's going on inside his twisted humorous mind.

Mostly I think this follows the tradition of most movies which have "all star" casts.  Too many famous names means the director is compensating for lack of good writing, plot or anything else that could be justifiably worth your time to watch.
All actors involved should be embarassed to have their names attached to this title. Afterward this left me hoping that the writers/directors have been permanently black-balled from ever touching recordable media again.
