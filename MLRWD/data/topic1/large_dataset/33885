After turning two of the most hard-hitting dramas within roughly the past ten years (Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile), I had high expectations for the Majestic. What we get, dismayingly, is a warmed-over tribute to 1950's Marxists, and for all of you Joe McCarthy haters out there, I would remind you that since we know that many of McCarthy's accusations were correct (as verified by project Venona, a collection of KGB files released at the fall of the Soviet Union), as well as the fact that McCarthy insisted on his hearings being secret (hearings that raging Democrats insisted go public), the premise of the film is rather comical. Of course, McCarthy had little if anything to do with HUAC, being, of all things, a member of the senate instead of the house. Mark my words, however, reviewers of this film will babbble about how it crystalizes a time when America was in the death-grip of Joe McCarthy. Hardy har, har. Read Ann Coulter's "Treason," and get back to me once you have salvaged your knowledge of history from the Marxist revisionists.

Aside from the liberal-drooling, its just a bad film. Anti-climatic, glossed over, and as sentimental as a Disney movie with a talking dog. I hated every moment of it, and have lost respect for Darabont as a director. See at your own risk, but don't say I didn't warn you.
