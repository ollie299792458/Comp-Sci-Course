PLEASE PLAY THIS MOVIE LOUD.
Not my words, but an instruction written by Eddie Vedder on the inside cover of the DVD case. But what sound advice it is. Never before have I seen a music video that pleases on so many levels. To be honest it isn't quite perfect. But that's only because some of my personal 'Jam' favourites are missing from the set-list. Aside from that, the tracks that are included are classics, and performed with such vigour and vitality, that you really wish you'd been there at every single concert. From rousing renditions of Corduroy and Grievance, right through Given To Fly and Even Flow, and ending with Neil Young's powerful and energetic Rocking in the Free World, it's difficult to stop the disc and take a break. 
The extras provided are good. We get the videos of Oceans and the remarkably interpreted Evolution, as well as montage videos of the band on tour and generally larking about. It's great to see a band behaving so naturally on stage and clearly enjoying themselves so much. They don't seem to take themselves so seriously nowadays, and it shows through their music. 
I absolutely adore this music, and always will, that's why the disc has a treasured place in my collection. Whether you worship Pearl Jam, like them or have never heard them before, buy this DVD and get enlightened. 
Oh, and don't forget... PLAY IT LOUD.
