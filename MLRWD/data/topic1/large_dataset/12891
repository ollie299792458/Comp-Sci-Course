A way for people to get my opinion on the movie is on a this scale
  The best movies I'll recommend to my old friends, family, bosses(make'm think you're smart). Solidly average movies I'll recommend to work aquaintances, extended family, facebook friends. A bad movie but I don't care about the time lost watching it, I just forget.  Anything worse, I write a review.

To me, the ads for this film made it seem enticing, I was expecting a Nacho Libre sort of fun.  Instead I got a film I'll probably never see again.  Let me say, I'm one of the group still a fan of Will Ferrell. That dumb juvenile comedy is great and would rather see Will Ferrell act than Adam Sandler.  HONESTLY, I don't think I've liked a Sandler comedy since Waterboy (and then I was 10).
First of all, I didn't need how they made it an offense to westerns.  I loved westerns and wish there are more today.  I hoped they would use some cliche but c'mon. Spoiler Alert: Why film on such a purposely bad stage? Cheap joke? That's a joke I out-grew after I graduated high school...I just kept shaking my head the whole time.  If Id spent $12 at the movies to watch that- I would've been furious.
Second, the spanish story.. the writing is like you took four teenagers and taught them spanish over summer, and asked them to write a story.  You find out when they're finished that they really loved the new spanish curse words they learned.
Big spoiler:  Finally the story.  A good parody needs a real honest theme in its backbone. To use a saying, its got to have heart.  I'm half-latino and yes, I even find spanish culture ridiculous at times. Loyalty to family, machaismo, religion, etc.  If they were going to make two brothers fight over honor, let's at least try to make both character's motivation crisply clear. Something real and down to earth, don't half-ass it.  This is the biggest problem of the movie.
