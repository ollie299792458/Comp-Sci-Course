Every once in a while a movie comes along that elicits extremes of either like or displeasure. As far as The Usual Suspects is concerned, I have friends who say that this is a movie too enamored of its own convoluted  inventiveness to rank among the all-time classics: Personally, I disagree  and  think this is a masterpiece of a movie. Christopher McQuarrie's Oscar  winning screenplay, skillfully brought to life by director Bryan Singer, is  a patchwork of elements that combine to thrill the viewer and draw you ever  deeper into the intricate web of the plot.  Kevin Spacey deservedly won an  Oscar for his portrayal of Verbal Kint, the club-footed short con artist  who gets mixed up with a gang of hardened felons - delightfully played  Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, and Benicio Del Toro - but  all is not as it appears.  
The central theme of the movie is one of  detection: Who is the criminal mastermind  Kyser S&ouml;ze ? Does he exist and  if so, who is he?  The five crooks find themselves forced by S&ouml;ze's  supposed lawyer, wonderfully played by the British actor Pete  Postlethwaite, into performing a daring raid to interrupt a cocaine deal -  but is this really the reason for the ninety-one million dollar exchange?  The story is recounted by Spacey to the investigating customs officer,  played by the skillful Chazz Palmintieri, in ever increasing levels of  complexity.  The to and fro between Palmintieri and Spacey is a delight to  watch but it would spoil the experience to describe the scenes in too much  detail.  Suffice it to say that the end is not what we are led to expect!  This movie is an all round pleasure: the writing inventive, the acting  delightful, and the visual clues are a creation of the writer and director  that require a second viewing to fully appreciate. The bulletin board... but  that would be giving it away!
