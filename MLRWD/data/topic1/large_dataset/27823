Congrats to Close who helped write the screenplay, and of course who was the actor playing Albert Nobbs in the movie and now DVD.  She also played Nobbs in an Off -Broadway play in 1982.  Talk about being persistent and following through, Close has chased this for 20 year and finally after some false starts has gotten together.  Way to go Girl.  I suppose her devotion is reflected in every small flicker of an eyelid, all measured in whether it further reflects her character.  How did I know this?

It's all on the DVD Commentary by Close and Rodrigo Garcia, instead of talking about certain camera angle, handhelds versus, stationary, this DVD actually explains the reason Close, with the co-operation with Rodrigo, studied her character and used every nuance, shift or her weight, eye contact or lack of eye contact to further the character and reveal her Nobb's life.

If you haven't checked out the commentaries on this and other DVD's you're often  missing part of the journey and understanding the hidden meaning of a story.  Like anything some are better than others.  This one (Albert Nobbs) is worth spending some time to watch.
