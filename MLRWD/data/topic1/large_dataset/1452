Deep in the ruins of a once glamorous mansion, lurks the living ghost of Norma Desmond, the siren of the silent screen, for whom time has stopped. Left alone with her memories of Old Hollywood, she waits to make her return.  William Holden plays the down on his luck writer who stumbles into this house, haunted with the ambitions of Norma (Gloria Swanson) to make her great return (not comeback! I hate that word!) to the people she left behind.  Holden becomes the reluctant giggolo who helps her rewrite the script of "Salome", Desmond's return vehicle.  The film seethes with dark secrets and the bitterness aimed at Hollywood, the great dream factory.  This is Billy Wilder's crwoning acheivement as a director.  A masterpiece that " . . . should be studied frame by frame."
The big disappointment with this release is the lack of a widescreen edition.  The transfer to DVD has some flaws but it shouldn't stop you from enjoying the most magnificent movie ever made about Hollywood.
