Sometimes it makes a difference which version of a show you see first.

I was actually suprised when I saw the U.K. version. Usually, I ALWAYS like the European version of a production much better than the American remake. But not in this case. Maybe it's partly because I saw the U.S. version first, which is more glitzy and glamourous, but the UK version actually bored me. I didn't like the dialogue as much (had nothing to do with the Manchester accents)for one. For another, I kept comparing the Stuart character to the Brian character. Aiden Gillen (as Stuart) can't hold a candle to Gale Harold (as Brian) in the sexiness department. Also, I had a hard time believing that Stuart(that slight somewhat girly guy) was this huge Canal Street Stud! And, I'm used to the strong dance/pop/rock/trance musical backdrop of the U.S. version, instead of that folksy guitar score in the U.K. version.

Since I saw the more dramatic, faster paced, glitzier U.S. version first, the U.K. version seemed boring. If I had seen the grittier, slower paced, artsy-er, more realistic U.K. version first, then I would probably think that the U.S. version was too over-the-top. And I might also think that Brian was too tall!

Nevertheless, the U.K. version is a fine show.
