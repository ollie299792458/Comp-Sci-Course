First, I wanted to address a 1 star review that complained because they couldn't get the BD version to play in their BD player and got an error message about needing an upgrade.

Many of the BD movies require that your Blu Ray player have the latest firmware available from it's manufacturer.  They also frequently require that the BD player have at least 1GB of additional memory in order to play the BD disk.  This is especially common with BD disks that include the BD Live option.

Most players can be connected to the Internet via a standard Ethernet cable if you have a connection to the Internet via DSL or cable services.  Check your manual for instructions on how to hook your BD player to the Internet and upgrade it's firmware. It's usually done through the menu options in the BD player itself.

Also check your BD player manual on what type of flash memory card or stick it uses and how to install it.  There is usually a slot for it in the rear of the player. The slot is frequently labled EXT, at least on Sony BD players. You can get these memory cards at most stores that sell electronics and cameras or order them online at Amazon.  A 1GB card or stick is usually sufficient.

As for the movie, this is a fantastic transfer with stunning detail and clarity on the video and exquisite sound. Don't wait!  Order this movie today!
