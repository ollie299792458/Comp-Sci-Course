This film, released in 1969, is one of this reviewer's all time favorites.  Sam Peckinpah was such a brilliant director, and much of Mr. Peckinpah  shows through William Holden's superb performance, as Pike.  Holden, Ernest  Borgnine, Robert Ryan and Edmund O'Bryan lead in this powerful film, that  actually caused some theater-goers to walkout of the theater, in '69.  The  violence is still outstanding, even by today's standard, that many seem to  think of when you mention Sam Peckinpah.  This flick is truly astonishing,  and the dvd-format is great.  The 2:85 aspect ratio really puts this  remarkable film into perspective.  A must-have for this reviewer.  The only  potential drawback to this dvd is that it is a "2-sided" disc,  meaning halfway through the film, you have to...that's right; flip the disc  over.  Another thing that this reviewer and many of my friends don't care  for is that the disc is secured in a "snap-case" as are all  Warner Bros. dvd's.  But nevertheless, if you own a dvd player, and love  this movie like I do, it's worth it.
