I would rate this higher except that the first season is incomplete.  There are a number of shows not on this so-called first season.  There are 11 episodes from the first year and the last two episodes from the ninth year.  What's up with that.

I have always been a fan of Touched By An Angel.  The series was my Sunday-go-to-church-program.  I needed it to get through my week--to remind me what life needs to be like.  I learned almost two months before the First Season was come out.  I was so excited.  I've waited along time for this, expecting the full season.

But as anyone will see when they purchase this, there is no complete season.  The Christmas episode with Randy Travis called "Fear Not" is a two part series.  The second part is not there.  I have no idea why not--it should be.  In this regard, this is false advertisement.  Otherwise.... I love the series and have watched all 13 segments.

But please--don't be surprised--you won't get the whole season.
