All my life I believed in the Spiritual Jesus. In this movie I discovered Jesus as a Man. I witnessed His strengths and His weaknesses, but I felt Him, His pain, love, and sense of humor. Every line comes directly from the  Bible, the Book of Matthew. Finally, Jesus is real in my life, not just  spiritual. I feel that I know Him, and He is MY friend. As children, we  learn the song, "Jesus Loves Me." Now view the film and learn  that "You Love Jesus" as Biblical characters come to life and the  film puts you in touch with Jesus, the spiritual and human man who teaches  and entertains. This is a must have for all families, churches, and school  libraries. You will want to share it with family, friends, and neighbors.  Treat yourself or someone you love. Discover that YOUR life is important.  Feel good because that is the way HE wants it to be! The cost of this video  is a small investment in a better life for all generations. Our payment is  small in comparison to HIS.
