Most people who consider buying this set will probably be fans of early talkies. For anybody else who's intrigued but not sure what the movies would be like, here's an overview by a non-expert.

One of the two discs is devoted to TWO versions of Baby Face. The message of the original version is that real love soars when it's untethered from role-playing, when man and woman see each other as equals. The message of the censored version is that if a girl wants a good marriage, she needs to understand her proper, subserviant role. This film was the "straw that broke the camel's back" and made censorship standard. In my opinion the two best things about both versions are:

(1) the fresh, natural acting of Barbara Stanwyck. Her character lives in the early '30s, but her acting is anything but dated. The guys are more cardboard.

(2) the extended and natural relationship between Stanwyck's character and her character's best friend, who happens to be black. I'm not sure if any other relationship like this appears in mainstream movies for several decades.

Waterloo Bridge, on the other disc, has an excellent script and also boasts natural, strong acting by both the female and male leads. There's no mistaking the fact that it's a film of a stage play. It's still more believable and fun than some films that won Oscars back then.

Redheaded Woman is enjoyable; Harlow and Una Merkel are good. But to me the film seems like a warm-up for Baby Face.

Bottom line: I'm glad I bought this set. If you're intrigued I'd snap one up before it disappears.
