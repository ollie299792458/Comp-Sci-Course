Historical inaccuracies aside, this movie was the best I've seen in a long while.  Kevin Costner was even colder than usual (as in "For the Love of the Game"), an expressionless look on his face for much of the movie, but anything else would not have done justice to the character.  The supporting cast was unremarkable, but Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday was incredible...in my opinion, he stole the show and deserved much more screen time.  While many of the Earp brothers (excluding Wyatt, of course) were faceless and often difficult if not impossible to tell apart, Quaid captured Doc Holliday's character in every action--speaking, riding, making one of those cynical and hilarious one-liners (Like when Wyatt confides in Doc that he is his closest friend, and Holliday replies, after a long silence, "Shut up," or when he comments that Wyatt wants to be a lawman and an outlaw, getting "the best of both worlds.").  It took me a considerable amount of time, at least an hour, to finally believe the video case and conclude that Doc Holliday was in fact played by Dennis Quaid.  How did that large, handsome, all-american actor from "Frequency" manage to pull off a skinny, dying man?  And that voice...I loved the voice of Doc Holliday, and would rewind the tape sometimes to listen again.  Rich and deep, it was the only thing that ultimatly conviced me that Holliday was played by Quaid.
Undoubtably a movie worth seeing, even more than once, I recommend Wyatt Earp to anyone.
