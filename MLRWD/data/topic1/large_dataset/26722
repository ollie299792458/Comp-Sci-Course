This is a surprisingly good addition to Hammer's classic Dracula series, though it's certainly not the strongest of the films in the franchise. It is, however, the most risqu&eacute;, surprisingly so. In addition, this Anchor Bay release of the film has a bonus second feature entitled; The Many Faces of Christopher Lee, which is a lot of fun for fans of the legendary actor, especially the ludicrous music videos included, which are absolutely hilarious.  Really, Hammer never made a bad Dracula or Frankenstein film, and it's a shame that most modern horror enthusiasts lack an appreciation for these old gems, because they're really missing out. This one is especially worth picking up, because of the second feature, and perhaps might be a good entry level film for modern film goers, since there is a bit more blood and skin in this one.

Also, in response to an earlier reviewer's statements, Bela Lugosi only played Dracula twice on film, once in Dracula, and once in Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein. Christopher Lee, however, played him ten times, and for my money, is the superior count.
