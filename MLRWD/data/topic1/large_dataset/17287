If you are looking for a film to watch numerous times, to study, analyze and rediscover, look no further.  Granted, if you do not like anime, then recommending Paprika would be a waste of time.  Its quality of animation and style is visually astounding and reminiscent of Studio Ghibli at its prime (I am not familiar with Mad House Studios' other works).  It does not squander minutes on shock value or making the films message glaringly obvious as a lot of baser animes tend to do these days.  Paprika maintains a light-hearted mood which never completely fades even as the movie rises in insanity all the way up to the climax.

The visuals are flawless, the soundtrack is flawless, and from a directorial standpoint - Paprika is flawless.  While the movie unfolds as gracefully and seamlessly as a dream would (as it is quite literally about dreams), it manages to stay somewhat intellectual so that when the credits role and you are allowed to wake, you are still left with powerful messages to ponder over and an excellent film to re-watch.  All you have to do is sit back and let yourself be guided into a world you can only relate to from having been asleep.

I can't emphasize it enough: 5 stars.
