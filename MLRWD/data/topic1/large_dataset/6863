The Reduced Shakespeare Company is a hilarious interpretation of the complete works of William Shakespeare...abridged. The running time time of the play is about ninety wonderful minutes. The Company begins with Romeo and Juliet, and then proceed through the rest of the plays to end with their hilarious rendition of Hamlet. This play is very educational, and the more educated you are, the funnier it will be.

I first watched this a long time ago, while I was rather ignorant of much of Shakespeare. I recently watched this again, after having read and studied a little Shakespeare, and it was much funnier. Bear in mind, I still do not know much about Shakespeare and his plays, I imagine that this would be nonstop laughs for an English teacher.

I only have one minor complaint about the whole show. I thought that the scene in hamlet, where they get the crowd involved, was slightly drawn out. It is wonderful that they have so much crowd involvement, but that scene just never seemed to end. Fortunately, it did end, and the play resumed. I highly recomend this wonderful play to anyone who can enjoy a good, well educated laugh. The Reduced Shakespeare company will not disappoint.
