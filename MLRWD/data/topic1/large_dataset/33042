This film is an abysmally banal attempt to tell what its filmmakers allege is a true story. The teens depicted in the film, and the actors who portray them, are so without emotion that the performances are forced and empty quite apart from the story they are forced to tell.
The character of Marty, acting as a seeming martyr, is without substance or foundation and gives one whiplash as his passivity turns to self-righteous outrage.  His feelings of thoughtful and tolerable friendship with Bobby turn to one of hatred and contempt so quickly and without a believable footing that this shift is deemed meaningless.  Lisa as Marty's savior and guardian uses him to justify her own apparent rage toward Bully Bobby following his rape of her friend and as a result approaches the same level of dominance over Marty as practiced by the film's title character.
The filmmakers' attempt to tell what they call a  "true" story is done so in the most inconceivable, trite, and clich&eacute;d way despite the violent and tragic events upon which it is alleged to be based.  It as well loses the circumstances and events of that story amidst melodramatic story telling and "artistic" license that turns it message into an insulting attempt to add contrived drama to an otherwise powerful tragedy.  At any rate that story it tells is unrecognizable.
The filmmaker's refusal to explore the foundation of the characters' personalities and circumstances upon which their actions are based doesn't allow one to care much at all about their troubles or imposed plight. The film's attempt to shock and disturb its audience buries the story it strains to tell.  How the director's critical success with "Kids" led to this drivel is beyond me.
Renters of the film may wish to take a chance, but buyers should be aware.
