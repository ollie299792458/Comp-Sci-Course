I need to vent. Okay, here goes: it's a real shame that film critics can't sit back and appreciate a movie for what it is. In this case, a harmless little graduation movie.
What I loved about this film was that it features all the typical characters that you would find in high school; the most popular guy, who really isn't all that. The most popular girl, given said status based on looks rather than personality and always judged on her looks. Her group of "friends" [one of whom scarily resembles - in terms of personality - someone I go to school with]. The sensitive guy, the cynical girl, the guy in a desperate bid for the title of "cool" and the nerd, who really isn't so nerdy if you give him a chance.
So yeah, I love the movie. Now it's time for the special features to be reviewed:
* Commentary by directors Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan and the cast - the "cast" happens to be Seth Green, who for a fair bit of the commentary is speaking in a Brithish accent. I really enjoyed this commentary, and have listened to it a few times. You get a real sense that they enjoyed making this film. You also get a sense of annoyance from realising just how much of their work was cut. Worth listening to [more than once].
* Theatrical trailer(s) - the best part about the trailers is the fact that 90-99% of the footage wasn't in the actual film. Consider it a cut scenes real.
* Music video "Can't Get Enough of You Baby" by Smash Mouth - ah, yes. The soundtrack band [they've been on at least 5 by our last count]. I'm not a fan of Smash Mouth. Let's leave it at that.
* Photo gallery - I've only flicked though them once, and that was more than enough. They weren't really bad just...dull?
A fan of the movie will buy this DVD regardless of the not-so-special features. Like I did. The best part about owning this on DVD is the ability to just put it on when you feel like a quick laugh without the pesky rewind problem.
