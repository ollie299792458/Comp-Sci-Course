"The Bucket List", starring Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman is a sometimes funny, sometimes poignant look at two cancer patients who meet when they are both hospitalized in one of Jack Nicholson's hospital.  Nicholson plays Edward Cole, and is rich; Freeman (Carter Chambers) isn't (he's a mechanic).  Chambers is married; Cole is married to his work.  Both are seriously ill, and given months to live.  Chambers starts jotting on a pad, curious about the note, Cole picks it up.  Chambers is not happy, but allows that it is a 'bucket list', i.e. a list of things to do before one dies.

Cole decides to make both of their lists a reality.  First on the list, skydiving.  Then, racing a Mustang 350 race car, Mount Everest and other things.

When the movie came out, the reviews were mixed, and I wasn't that motivated to see it.  However, one came to me, and I watched it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Both actors do a good job allowing the audience to understand a bit of how it is to face one's last illness.  Both Cole and Chambers grow from knowing one another; the single Cole grows the most.

Recommended.  It's a good movie and I enjoyed watching it.
