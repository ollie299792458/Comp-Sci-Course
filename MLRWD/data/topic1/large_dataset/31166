I bought this yesterday on the strength of having seen four short Star Wars clips on adult swim. The clips were hilarious, I mean tears of laughter streaming down my cheeks.

Obviously I put the disc in my player with high expecations. What a let down. Of the four Star Wars clips I saw earlier this week, one was included on the disc. Where was "Palpatines Trip"? Where was "He said set to stun!", Where was "Take you daughter to work day"?.

As you can probably tell all of the clips that hooked me were missing. I bought this disc as I thought it would be a good collection to have, but it was luke warm at best. I think I laughed at about three of the clips. I have a feeling that all of the missing clips will be contained within the season box sets. Wish I hadn't wasted my time on this set, $3 per clip that made me laugh just wasn't worth it.

Watch the clips on Adult Swim and I hope the Box sets are better.

*****Update*****

It seems that there is a second installment of this, episode II, this one probably contains all of the clips that I missed. Shame I couldn't find this out before buying it.
