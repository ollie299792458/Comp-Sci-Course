Corman was the king of no money, low budget films and this collection proves it. Special effects, when there are any, are childish even for those times. However, the story line, especially "Not Of This Earth" & "Attack Of The Crab Monsters" are not too far fetched. If they were produced with better special effects they might have been considered good sci-fi classics, but, given what he had to work with they are nothing more than curiosities at best. For instance, the creature which is let loose towards the end of "Not of..." is so stupid and ineffective, besides seeing the wires, it should have been left out entirely. It ruins what credibility the film had. The actors do the best they can with some decent performances turned in by virtual unknowns. Corman re-made this one with an updated campy version showing a lot of "T & A" starring a porn star and a better budget but didn't hit the mark either. He turned it into a stupid version of the original, if that is possible.
"Attack Of The Crab Monsters" again with a very low budget and stock footage, has some interesting characters, like the Professor from Gilligan's Island, Russell Johnson. The dialog is stupid and calling the only female in very tight clothes who is suppose to be a scientist "honey" doesn't work either. Unfortunately,the creatures are the problem, also. Stupid looking. However, this could have been a good classic with more money. The premise is good, radioactivity from the bombs mutating crabs to enormous size and intelligence, sucking the brains from its' victims and knowing their secrets(we did see this in "Starship Troopers"), but, no clear reason why they are destroying the island.
If you can overlook this collection's short comings it might be worth a one time look. But don't spend too much money on it.
