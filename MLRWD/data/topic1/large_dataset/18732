I was looking forward to seeing this when I first heard about the possibility. Finally saw it. OMG. I am SO glad I didnt shell out money for tickets and popcorn to see this in the show. ABSOLUTELY AVOID THIS. DO NOT WATCH, unless you want your eyes to bleed. I wish I could get back the time spent in watching this turkey. As it is, I watched it on pay per view, $4.99. I almost called the cable company to get my money back.

A BIG mistake to try to duplicate one of the Three Stooges shorts; no one did it better than the originals. Now, if the producers had made a biofilm of their lives, including their collaborations with Ted Healy, I think that could have made a great film. Did you know that Larry Fine was a genuinely accomplished violinist? Early in his life he was burned on the arm by spilled acid, so he was made to take violin lessons to strengthen his arm. Did you know that Shemp Howard attempted to extend his range by appearing as a comedic actor or a gangster in a number of non-Stooge films, including CHARLIE CHAN IN RENO?

I might suggest The Three Stooges: The Triumphs and Tragedies of the Most Popular Comedy Team of All Time, by Jeff Forrester and Tom Forrester as a very good expose of all things Stooge, including Ted Healy's relationship with them, and all of the subsequent Stooges that took Curly's and Shemp's place after their deaths.
