Perhaps the most underrated film ever made. Barry Lyndon is one the most beautifully crafted films in any genre. The film is set in the 18th century, the Age of Reason. But personal feelings and motivations seeped up through the rationalist surface of that time. Barry Lyndon, more than any other film, captures the essence of the 18th century. The costumes, cinematograghy, and settings are all beautiful. Ryan O'Neal, who plays Barry Lyndon, is quite good in the title role. Some have commented that this Stanley Kubrick's most boring film. Actually, important and interesting things happen in every scene.
There's too many events, surprises, and turns in this film to write about them here, which would ruin it for a first time viewer anyway. Barry Lyndon is an Irish scoundrel who is determined to climb up the ladder of the strict British class system. He's not a perfect scoundrel and gets caught off guard several times in the film. The film has a subtle sense of humor like the duel between Barry and the fearful Capt. Quinn. The seduction of Lady Lyndon by Barry in and outside of a gaming room is wonderfully done. There's no dialogue in that scene at all, but if there was it wouldn't have been as effective. Bryan's (Barry's son) deathbed and funeral scenes accompanied by Sarabande music are powerful. When Barry was in the Royal Army he got into a fistfight with another soldier. His opponet was bigger and had the brut strength that Barry didn't have. But Barry was more cunning and quicker so he won the fight. The scene says a lot about the character and the plot. There's a lot more but you really have to see it for yourself.
