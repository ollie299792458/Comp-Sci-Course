This film is not for most people; it's very morose and gruesome at times, and it won't be entertaining and satisfying in the same way most mainstream movies are.  It does however provide a very shocking and revealing look at  the lives of a hopeless drunkard and a lonely prostitute.  
Nicholas Cage  and Elizabeth Shue are superb portraying their characters and their skill  is the driving force of the film.  That isn't to say, however, that the  directing, music, and screenplay weren't excellent as well.  
One  particularly important aspect of the film is the relationship that forms  between Cage and Shue.  Some reviewers describe it as sincere love,  however, I don't agree.  Both Cage and Shue are desolate and vulnerable.  The natural thing for both of them to do when they meet is to seek refuge  in each other.  Shue might love Cage, but it's more out of desparation for  company than what she sees in him.  Cage's interest in Shue is somewhat  more confusing.  Before his introduction to Shue, I got the impression that  he was completely detatched from anything earthly.  The relationship he  maintains with Shue suggests otherwise though.  I'm not really sure, yet,  what to make of Cage.
I never really knew what alcohol could do to a man  until seeing this movie. Sure, a random drunk on the street is a common  sight, but most people, who don't have a friend or family member with the  problem, don't realize the extreme extent to which the obsession can  develop.  I'd recommend this film to anyone older than 17.
