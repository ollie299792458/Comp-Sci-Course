I've been seeing some rather poor reviews on this new Maiden title on several other sights.  I myself just picked up the Blu-Ray & C.D. and I must say, Go Maiden!!!  See, I caught this show when they past through Phoenix and yes, it's not really my favorite when it comes to their song line up.  However, this is the band that has never quit!!!  I'm in my 40's now and I've been a fan since 15 years old.  I've seen the good times, the bad times, and the forever changing times, yet here's MAIDEN!!!  Never quit when the going got rough and never charged me an arm and a leg just to get up by the front of the stage to get a closer view.  Not sure if everyone's up on the ticket prices these bands that quit then "re-start" back up years down the road are charging...  It's a crime and I don't get suckered into it ever!!! Iron Maiden's not charging those silly prices and I keep coming back for more.  So Iron Maiden comes out with something new with the "ASAP" attitude which their known for as of late, and it's not always a 10 star attempt.  Who cares, love it cuz they love it!!!  Roll with it cuz that's what they've always done for us!!!  Keep up the great work Maiden.  UP THE IRONS!!!
