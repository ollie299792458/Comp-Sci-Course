Roland Emmerich makes some of the worst sci-fi out there, if you look at sci-fi from the viewpoint of plausibility and realism. His movies are typically laughable from a realism standpoint. "Independence Day", "2012" and "Stargate" are all howlers that induce massive facepalms from both critics and serious sci-fi fans, which I consider myself one.

That said, I am irresistibly attracted to his movies. I like them a lot, even though I feel guilty for doing so! LOL. Emmerich doesn't give a rat's butt about scientific accuracy or plot plausibility. He just wants to make crazy over-the-top special-effect-laden sci-fi spectacles, and he succeeds. I own all three movies listed above and enjoy them very much.

I won't get into the plot here, as many other reviewers have taken care of that. I'll just say that watching a movie about humans traveling via artificially-created wormhole to another galaxy and duking it out with the Egyptian sun god Ra is a brainless and fun way to spend an evening at home.

Blu-ray transfer quality is excellent. Audio is crystal-clear and hammers at you relentlessly throughout the movie. This is a good movie for a subwoofer-equipped home theater system.
