i liked the movie immensely, up until we follow the priest down into the hole to face- the GIRL DEVIL?! im sorry, forgive me if im wrong, but in the first movie, a priest talking to father carras clearly states, "the same thing happened to father merrin in africa. in that case, the possessed was a young BOY." a BOY. the little boy, which all the evidence pointed to all throughout the prequel, was the clear antagonist. why the stupid twist? there was no TWIST needed! if i wanted to see the devil in the possessed female, id watch the ORIGINAL. that was just plain STUPID. aside from that retarded mistake, this movie was GREAT. i especially liked the boy getting ripped apart by the hyenas while the possessed boy looked on... although the boy's cries of pain... whoever told the boy how to scream, where it sounds almost like he is laughing, while that screaming/laughing formula worked well for the bearded-guy in "the blair witch project", it failed here. a little authenticity will go a long way. this scream/laugh mix sounded way too fake for me. i can see what the director was going for, obviously, but the boy screwed it up. a little more training could have cleared that up, maybe. oh, and i loved the upside-down jesus. ha! great. not nearly as hilarious as the blasphemous mother-mary statue from the original, but you get the point. still quite something to laugh about. a really good movie, all in all, but the twist-ending just HAS to go. blech. is hollywood to blame for that mistake? hmm.
