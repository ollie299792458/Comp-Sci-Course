Do you want to see a plot repeat itself 3 times before coming to a conclusion the 4th time around?
See this movie.
And what saves it the 4th time around anyway?  An endearing old woman who gets hurt urges Helen Hunt to "stop" the madness that is the TORNADO.  While you're at it, Helen, stop the earthquakes, too.  Maybe you can throw some Pepsi cans in a crack and get some "readings."  Okey-dokey.
If you're looking for a dynamic plot, forget it.  It just keeps twisting around, and around, and around...owww.
Don't get me wrong.  It is a visual feast, but so improbable even if it does open up under the premise of "the worst storm activity" in who-knows-how-long.  It's still improbable all the same and our bad guy (Mr. Elwes himself of Princess Bride fame) is not so much a bad guy but an excuse to provide Bill Paxton "motive."  If you can call it that.  Wrap that around a confused separated-but-rediscovering-love plot twist and you wind up with a cookbook Hollywood film bound to please Hollywood executives with $$$.
It's not bad.  Artistically, however, it also gives you nothing new.  So...5 stars for brainless action and thin plot...2 stars for a motion picture.
