Okay, it's official.  Ravi Singh and Ana Brett are the official King and Queen of kundalini yoga dvd's.  The two new ones are wonderful!  Others have written detailed reviews so all I can add at this point is that both dvds have the same 3 meditations: 1 minute breath,sodarshan chakra kriya and kirtan kriya.  One little thing was that I was expecting 6 new meditations instead of just 3 meditations. For whatever reason, the same meditations are on both dvds.  I especially love the sa ta na ma (kirtan kriya) meditation.  You get the full 11 minute version (normally done for 31 minutes).  Yogi Bhajan said that this is the most important meditation in all of kundalini yoga and if you only do one meditation, this one is it.  Thank you raviana, now I can do this meditation for 40 days using your dvd.
I would have liked it if they had given us 11 minutes of sodarshan charkra kriya, as such they just give 2 1/2 minutes.  All in all great set for just about everything that ails you in today's modern, fast paced, toxic life. Sat Nam
