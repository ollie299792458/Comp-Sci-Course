I'm a huge fan of the charecter, seen all the movies with his name attached to it, now that i've seen all as of now, I can shout that this one has the most bang for its buck.  Why would anybody want to change such a great book when switching from paper to film? beats me, this movie thankfully stays on track.
  Rated R for good reason ,this movie doesnt  leave room for the charecters not be what you expect from a movie called "Punisher Warzone".
  The actors look well into thery're gritty comic book counterparts and the attitude expressed isnt work to see the whole crew behind the movie isnt afraid to paint the town red.  I personally dont see the reason for this movie not to be a blockbuster. The mix of gun blazing action with horror movie level gore perhaps does blend well for most people maybe.  I think the answer to that is would you expect a vigilante wearing a skull bodysuit on crazed revenge driven rampage against crime and the corrupt to be a pretty sight?  Think twice kiddos.  The punisher is what Max Payne tried to be,  what rambo was famous for, and a action flick to have friends over to see.  BRING ON A NEW PUNISHER LEXI PLEASE!!!!!
