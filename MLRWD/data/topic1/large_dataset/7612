If you are watching HOUSE because you want cheap medical advice for your symptoms, you are misled, to say the least.  I would give nearly anything to verbally joust with a doctor like this.  He's painfully honest; accutely perceptive; adorable, in a rustic way; and at least you would know where you stand when he walked out the door.  I had a vet like this guy, once, and it was so refreshing to get what you paid for.  Too many doctors tiptoe around feelings, scared to death they will have to crank up the malpractic insurance coverage.  Hugh Laurie does an awesome job of being a genius in his field, and a sarcastic S.O.B. who no one can truly hate.  I have surmised that House will end up donating the sperm for Cutty's offspring...  let's face it, they are two peas in a pod (lonely, somewhat despirate for love, and misunderstood most of the time)... but that doesn't take the series very far.  And what's happening with the other characters?  Would they REALLY leave the show?  The interaction between House and new personalities would give the show a whole new twist...  not to mention, those new folks would have some pretty big shoes to fill.  All this said, I reccommend this series as a must have.  On those rainy days, when nothing else is appealing on the tube... you can always count on HOUSE to give you intense entertainment and force the gray matter to unravel each plot, sub-plot, and ultimate plot's mystery.
