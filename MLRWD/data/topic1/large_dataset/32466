There exists in Hollywood an underground band of moviemakers that wait for the opportunity to make flying pictures.  The Rocketeer is one of these pictures.
It is a great family movie sort of on the same level as the  Flash Gordon serials of the same era this movie depicts, plus many inside  references to fascism in Hollywood, Howard Hughes, and so forth.  Plus, the  art direction is outstanding throughout, giving us the Dog restaurant, and  hundreds of '30's reference points such as a WC Fields cameo and Artie  Shaw's Orchestra. Reasonably good acting and a total knockout for a  heroine. 
But the real reason to watch this picture is for the completely  accurate recreation of '30's aviation that swirls through the film.  Gee  Bees, Travel Airs, dirigibles, and autogyros are on regular view.  No only  that, the air of garage-level aviation of that time is correctly created.  This makes the picture enjoyable on a number of levels.  Too bad they never  made the sequels.
This is the perfect film to watch with your 12 year old  son on a rainy Sunday afternoon.
