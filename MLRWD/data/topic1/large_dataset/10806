I have to say that I never would have seen this movie if I had not been on a Sean Bean kick at the time.  I read the book years ago, and it was very exciting, so when I found out that Sean Bean was in the movie, I immediately rented it.  I was a little apprehensive of the movie because I never seem to like the roles that either Michael Douglas or Famke Janssen play.
The movie was exciting, overall; Brittany Murphy played Elizabeth well, and even now when I watch movies like Sin City, all I can think about is her singing "Dream a Little Dream" and twitching her fingers.  Michael Douglas was actually very likable as Nathan Conrad, and Skye McCole Bartusiak was very, very cute and lovable as Jessie, his daughter.
Unfortunately, what made Andrew Klavan's book so exciting was his villain, a very smart guy called Sport who hung out with a beastly evil and stupid fellow named Max.  Sport ended up being the typically British-Isles/vengeful/cunning/doomed-to-die sort of character that Sean Bean ALWAYS plays, and Max ended up being sort of likeable, making PB&J sandwiches for Jessie instead of just scaring her.  Probably the only saving grace was that Jennifer Esposito was a better character than her male counterpart in the book.
In retrospect, I think that the book was still better than the movie, but if you are a fan of any of the actors/actresses, it will do well enough as a late-night thriller.
