This as definatly a feel good movie. A sweet romantic comedy (leaning heavly on comedy) about three models who take up a expensive penthouse in New York hoping to catch themselves some millionairs. Schatze Page (Lauren Bacall)is a woman who is through with marrying poor men, or as she calls them "gas pump jockeys" for the simple reason that poor men have broken her heart. She's the brains of the bunch. Bacall is wonderfull in this film. Pola Debevoise (Marlyn Monroe) is the blonde, and blind, one who is really just going along with what shounds like a good idea. In this role Monroe pulls off a stunning performance, marked by her sweetness and child-like inocence, as well as many commedic scenes. She is somewhat sill (she beleives that her glasses make her unatractive) but warm-hearted.
Loco Dempsey (Betty Grable)is a girl who has an appetite..... for food. She is nice, somewhat dumb but a good person. Her performance is good, but not as outstaning as Monroe's.
Overall this is a really sweet movie with alot of substance.
