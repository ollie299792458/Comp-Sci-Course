Ben Barnes was delicious to look at throughout the movie, as Dorian Gray himself was supposed to be, so while he's literally not the incarnation of Dorian with golden hair as described in the novella, he is perfect as a representation of gorgeous, innocent, unbesmirched youth. Barnes was a good actor, too, I thought.

I didn't really grok on the whole added flashback thing with childhood beatings; that's a modern psychological construct that I felt was unnecessary and in fact detracted from the story (none of that was in the novella, was it?). I also felt they went way too over-the-top with the painting, which made it more campy and cheesy than creepy and scary.

I SO appreciated that this movie gave a nod to the homosexual element, as well as making the opium usage and extreme sex more overt. Dorian was engaged in corrupt activities, pushing the envelope during his time, and they didn't sugar coat that in this version. I loved the mother/daughter scene and the sexual encounter with Basil (is that why this movie wasn't released in the U.S.?). The Basic actor captured that character's longing and heartache.

Though there were added elements and changes, overall I felt this movie was quite faithful to the spirit of Oscar Wilde and what he intended. I've read the book a few times and while it's been quite awhile since my last read, this movie would be a good introduction for the modern reader/moviegoer. And of course Colin Firth was Colin Firth, who can't do much wrong.
