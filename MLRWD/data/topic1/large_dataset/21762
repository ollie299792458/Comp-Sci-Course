Animal House is a hilarious film about the delta fraternity on the campus of Faber College. Watching these charactors pull crazy stunts and getting away with anything they want was both entertaining and funny. The first time watching this film was the semester before I started college and this film made me grasp a different view on college life that I did not already know. I believe that this film is a classic and I recommend it to anybody, especially someone that is going to college because besides all the drinking and what goes on in the "Animal House," these charactors are generally funny, each having a special trait about them that makes you think of somebody that you know. This movie set a stereotype to all college fraternitys, and I believe that that is both good and bad. One thing is for sure, after watching this movie, I made sure I joined a fraternity not only for the parties, but mainly for the freindship I saw in the movie between the charactors. I recommend this movie to anybody. You'll be on the floor laughing and you'll see what I mean.
