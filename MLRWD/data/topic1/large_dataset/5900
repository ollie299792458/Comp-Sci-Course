I found this movie by accident. Gemma Jones stars as The Duchess of Duke Street. She is amazing in this role. I have watched it three times, which considering there are 31 episodes, must tell you how much I loved this movie!

It's a story about a young woman who fights her way up in the work force by starting as a servant in various homes, to becoming the best cook in England! She learns to cook from a male French chef. He thinks only men make good chefs and women are useless in general, let alone becoming chefs. She takes all he dishes out and then some. He ends up having great respect for her and becomes quite fond of her.

This teaches life lessons especially for girls as well as anyone who believes in themselves and won't let anyone or anything stand in her/their way.

This is one of the best films I have ever seen. I bought it for my daughter because she fell in love with it too.

There's romance, mystery, comedy, drama etc. Just buy it. You will not regret it. If I could meet Gemma Jones, It would be my honor to congratulate her on her best role ever. I have seen her in other movies and she can hold her own, but this one made her the star she is. I respect her and just love her acting abilities.
