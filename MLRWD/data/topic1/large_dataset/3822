I have to say, the more I see this film the more I enjoy it.  It is a very good movie and this HD DVD is an excellent presentation.  Being a combo disc, it is a little more expensive than the Blu-Ray version but you do get  full Dobly TrueHD sound and the ability to take the disc with you in the minivan, which makes it worth the extra few bucks.  I have a PS3 for Blu-ray playback and a Toshiba HD-XA2 for HD DVD playback both feeding to a 60" Sony XBR2 HDTV at 1080p. In this setup this disc look amazing!!!!  This if really one of the true reference discs for HD DVD.  There are NO flaws with this transfer, this really a good reference disc that you can show off what HD DVD can do. It is in a word, amazing!!!  Like I said before this is a combo disc, you can compare the HD quality vs standard DVD quality by just flipping the disc.  My kids love being able to take the movie in the mini-van.  Also, with a good audio setup this disc sounds amazing.  The mix is alive and eveloping and just makes the movie that more enjoyable.  If your looking for a good disc to show off that new HD DVD player, give this a try you won't be disappointed.
