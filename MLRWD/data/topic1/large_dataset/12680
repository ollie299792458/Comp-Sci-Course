This movie is funny, dramatic, sexy but most of all, inspirational. For anyone who is familar with Trance/House music, this is a great mockumentry based around DJ Sammy. Most Americans are even familar with DJ Sammy, so this is even a great movie for one who may not be particularlly interested in techno music. The movie opens with interviews from electronic music greats such as Tiesto, Paul van Dyk and more.
Most of the movie takes place in Ibiza, the Mecca for House/Trance music. For anyone who has never been to Ibiza, there is a great inside view of the these world famous clubs located in Ibiza (the real life, modern-day Studio 54).  A great sound track goes naturally with this movie. Coping with his hardcore drug problem, the main character is also going def. What does a world famous DJ do with his life when he can no longer hear, lose all his fame, lose his family and all love for life? He makes a #1 selling album, whats what he does.
Some of the best "one-liners" in any movie I've seen. You've got to watch this movie, it is so inspirational that when the movie ends, you will feel like you can do anything in the world you put your mind and heart into.
