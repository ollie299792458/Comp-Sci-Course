I don't give this movie so high a rating because it is a piece of cinematic art. On the contrary, "The Legend of Boggy Creek" is a grade B movie at best. The four stars above are based on the fact that "The Legend of Boggy Creek" has stood the test of time for this viewer. I first saw this "docudrama" about the Fouke, Arkansas member of the bigfoot clan on TV as a kid. Repeated viewings over the years have not dulled the late night enchantment of that first time. 
Produced in the early 1970's, "The Legend of Boggy Creek" is the documentary reminiscence of an unnamed and perhaps fictional narrator. The cast of unknowns and real people lend an air of credibility to the dramatizations of supposed actual encounters with the smelly, three toed, hairy hominid said to have stalked Boggy Creek. When it comes time to reveal the monster to the camera, the film makers were savvy enough to make most of his shots shadowy and/or distant. You know it is a man in a suit but you may find yourself wondering if there was (or is) an actual creature out there in the bottom lands of Arkansas.
If you have not already seen "The Legend of Boggy Creek" you may want to look for it on TV before buying. It may not hold the same charm for you that it does for me unless you are a fan of "psychotronic" film or, perhaps,a cryptozoologist.
