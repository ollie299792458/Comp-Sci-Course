The unrated directors cut of robocop is the reason I bought a dvd player.  When it came out on laserdisc years ago i begged my parents to buy me 1 so i could see it they then looked at the price of the player and the robocop  ld and flipped out. Later i found a book called the cutting room floor and  it eased my pain of not being able to see it.Now i have it on dvd criterion  and i couldnt be more thrilled with it.  Although it doesnt have that much  extra material it does change the feel of the movie.  At the beginning when  the executive gets blown away and some1 says "will some1 call a g.d.  ambulance" is now hilarious and murphy's death has a much more lasting  impact.  Murphy's death is the most sadistic i have ever seen in a movie  and with the added details its almost impossible to watch albeit there r  some very noticeable editing spots in it. The commentary is really good  pointing out the only time verhoven has ever appeared in one of his movies  and how orion felt about the movie in general.This movie is one of the all  time sci-fi classics and probably the most adult ever made definately not  for the jar jar binks crowd.
