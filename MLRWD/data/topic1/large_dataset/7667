I researched the true life story of the main polish character who led the group who escaped from Siberia and walked thousands of miles to India. There are many doubts about the veracity of the this perticular individual's story, due to historical evidence to the contrary. He was most likely released to go fight for the Soviets on the Eastern Front, and then immigrated to England.

Having said that, there are accounts of people walking of Siberia from the camps there during WWII, including an eyewitness account of several who miraculously ended up walking into India from Nepal.  A feat of the greatest human spirit and determination, due to incredible hardship, severe weather, and desolate barren wilderness/desert.

In any case, the story came across as believable and was well acted and produced. And one comes away with an awe at what some actually accomplished during this aweful time in history.

This movie won several awards I believe.  It is well worth a viewing.
