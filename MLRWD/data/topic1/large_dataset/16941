If you never liked Joan, this film may change your mind. Her royal Crawfordship uses all the skills she learned from her days as a silent star, to convey a woman attempting to outsmart her diabolical young husband &amp; his girl. She uses that chiseled face and those big eyes to great advantage. Her reactions to a walking toy dog, while hiding in a closet are priceless.  She was nominated for this performance, as was her rival, Bette Davis for "The Star" (ironically, playing a character rumored to be based on Joan!) Of the two, Joan's performance is the winner this time.  
Jack Palance is brute-hunkable as the husband, and Gloria Grahame puts the film in her pocket and walks away with it. If Gloria Grahame is your competion, than you SHOULD be worried! Ms. Grahame won the supporting actress award that year, but for "The Bad &amp; the Beautiful". (although this film, as well as "The Big Heat" show her at her devious best)
As Joan once said "If you want 'the girl next door', then go next door!" Just make sure it isn't Gloria Grahame.
