Apparently, lightning can strike in the same place twice.  And giant sharks can go on a rampange in the same place twice.  That's what the people who made this movie expect you to believe.  And so the only way to enjoy this film is not to take it too seriously.

I wish that they didn't make this movie.  The original was so perfect that any subsequent movie could only diminish the great beast's reputation. But while this movie looks crappy compared to its original, it looks brilliant and competent compared to the two sequels that would follow it.

Anyone who hasn't seen this movie and gets it should not expect to be terrified.  What made the first Jaws movie great is that we didn't actually see the shark until the very end whereas in this film we see it in the opening sequence.  This takes away the mystery and the fear of the unknown but I guess by now the director figured everyone knew what the shark would look like anyways.  The only difference in how this shark looks is that in the early part of the movie the shark gets burned on a side of its face which does give it a cool kind of look.  And how the shark is killed in this film is almost as clever as in the original.

Again, don't expect to be terrified.  This movie is a far better action/adventure story than a horror film.  Here are my rankings of the four Jaws movies:

Jaws: 5 stars.

Jaws 2: 3 stars.

Jaws 3: 2 stars.

Jaws the Revenge: 1 and 1/2 stars.

For most people this film will be a waste of time.  Maybe it is worth a rent but you should only buy it if you are a hard core Jaws fan.
