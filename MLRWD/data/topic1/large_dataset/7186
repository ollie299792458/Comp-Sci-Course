My mom never bought a DVD in her life, but she asked me to buy this one for her, even though it cost over $25.00. I confess I thought her nuts, when I first watched it. I thought some parts were rather booring. I had trouble hearing some of the dialogue, or fully understanding some of the scenes. Many questions came to my mind, but I was determined to discover what appealed to my mom. Why was so much time spent filming the train? So I will watch it again, and perhaps a few more times. I agree with my mom that the acting and cinematography are high quality. The themes are deep, and include an examination of soial class, behavior, as well as love, among other themes. There is ample symbolism to please any English teacher. The film is well thought-through, so that every story and every song has a place. Again another reason to watch this film over and over. And if you'd like to hear Gaelic or see some beautiful landscape shots, this film is for you. Some beautiful songs, humor, tension...
