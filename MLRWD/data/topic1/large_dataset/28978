...and kick [butt].  And I'm all outta bubblegum.
Corny, yes.  Horribly too long and mostly unnecessary "fight" scene in the middle, yes.  Somewhat questionable plot, yes.  But still one of the best movies that has been put on film.
Most of the things I have ever seen on this movie only talk about the bad actors that wrestlers make.  Personally I would like to see Roddy Piper do more.  I was impressed with the performance he put in this and I think it shows that the "characters" that wrestlers play in the ring are just that, characters.  Badly written characters perhaps, but it is still acting and it takes at least a little talent beyond overpumped biceps to play them well.  A few instances of his WWF character leaked through into this movie, but for the majority of it he was totally believeable.  He gave what I would consider to be an excellent performance regardless of his status as a pro-wrestler.  He didn't just give a good peroformance "for a wrestler" he gave a performance that *any* actor should be proud of.
Yes the movie was a bit on the cheesy side.  It was supposed to be.  This isn't some deep thoughts movie that the brie and beret set would go see at Sundance or something, it was intended as an entertaining way to spend 94 minutes of your time.  It isn't a large philosophical treatise on the state of the human condition, it is a cool story that lets you escape to another place for a while.
When I first bought my DVD player this was one of the first 5 movies I bought for it.  I specifically went out and searched for it (and garnered many strange looks from store clerks in my search).  It should be in everyone's movie collection if for no other reason than the classice one liner that makes up the title of this review.  Go buy it, now.  OBEY.
