I was familiar with this story from my college days, but otherwise I would not have been clear as to why these people were in Ecuador to begin with.  Were they anthropologists or what? In the first half of the film, they just seemed like these naive amateurs who knew little of the rainforest people they were trying to contact and ended up paying the ultimate price for their ignorance.  Meanwhile, the filmmaker seemed to want to hide their missionary purpose and pull it out of the proverbial hat later in the story. I also found much of the filmmaking rather clich&eacute;d---the overwrought separation scenes, the young son running after the plane, etc. A lot of this started to feel rather hoaky. And the tribal people are depicted as obssessed with "spearing" any one at the least provocation. They were trying to survive in a physically hostile environment and I would imagine the spearing was a product of that, but I'm not sure their gruesome violence was the center of their existence in the way the film seems to imply. If you read Jared Diamond's "Guns, Germs and Steel," for example, you learn in detail how the physical environment and the resources it affords, or the lack thereof, definitely draws out certain elements of human nature and shapes the life of any people living in that environment. That point seems to have been lost in this film. You can still subscribe to the Christian doctrine of original sin, but also recognize how a given environment, both physical and social, might impact human nature. So the paradox here is that the westerners in the story should have been depicted in a more straightforward fashion from the beginning of the story and the tribes people in a more nuanced fashion. The result would have been a better film.
