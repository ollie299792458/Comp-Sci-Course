The only reason I even bothered to rent this is because I am a big Jet Li fan. As far as Kung Fu star here in America Jet Li only falls second to Bruce Lee.
This movie is pretty simple, professional organized thieves break into a bank vault to steal these very valuable black diamonds. They find what they want only to get themselves into more trouble than they want. Jet Li plays a Taiwan CIA equivalent who is also looking for these black diamonds which turn out to not be diamonds at all. DMX plays the thief with a soft spot for his daughter who gets involved in this mess when the really bad guys kidnap her to get the black diamonds that were taken from them! The rest of the movie is DMX and Jet Li teamed up (DMX wants his daughter, Jet Li wants the black diamonds) chasing after the bad guys and kicking some ass like only Jet Li can. This is a cool action movie, the fight scenes with Jet are really good, the acting is so-so, the story is ok, but did I mention the fight scene with Jet is really good. Good enough reason for me to rent it!
