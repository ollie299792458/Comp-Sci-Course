I love Jack Black and especially in his Tenacious D years (see link below: but beware), but some may say this is immature, he is also a great talent. I think his role was perfect here and I do think he would be happy with such a "unique" production. The twist is unique and children were laughing a lot in the theatre so it is entertaining.

I think the direction could have been better. I think the story was lacking. The Mail Room replacement could have been meaner; there could have been a better story here. The big lesson(s) was/were missing.

If you are 8 years old, or have 8 year olds they may well love this. I think it would be a great way to spend the afternoon with a bucket of popcorn and Pepsi in hand.  It is by no means painful to watch. The adults I watched it with were slightly disappointed, but CRITICAL to remember that this is not aimed at adults. Admittedly there were very funny parts that even the tightest of grinches would have to laugh at.

If you are a Jack Black fan it's a most see.

I rate this 5 for the children in the audience and a 2/3 from myself and the other adults. A true feeling would be a 3.5. Be fair, if you honestly like movies that are a little immature (in the most positive of ways) you will be up there with the 5 perhaps.
