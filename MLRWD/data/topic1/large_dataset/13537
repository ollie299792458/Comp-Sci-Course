I had purchased to original Midway DVD release about 2 years ago or whenever it was and was very disappointed to find that the Battle of Coral Sea was cut out.  In addition to that I noticed the scenes of Charlton Heston's character's girlfriend were cut out as well, however they weren't an important part of the movie anyways so I didn't really care about that.  The original Midway DVD was the THEATRICAL RELEASE, something they neglected to put on the box.  This is really important because it is only in the TELEVISION version that the Coral Sea scenes were included.  The Collector's Edition is suppose to include scenes from the TV network version.  I'm pretty sure they are referring to the Coral Sea sequence.  I don't know whether or not they will include the WHOLE sequence, but I'm willing to bet they are.  So I'm ordering the DVD.  I don't really care if they add in the girlfriend scenes or not.  This is definitely a worthwhile purchase if you don't own it already.  And if you felt cheated, like I did when I purchased the original DVD, this is a good upgrade, too bad I have to pay for it.
