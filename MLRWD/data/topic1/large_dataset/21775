Steve McQueen plays the title role of the Cincinnati Kid; a young, up-and-coming poker player. The backdrop of the movie is 1930's New Orleans where we are introduced to Lancey Howard (Edward G. Robinson), a famous master of the game and the best player in the country. Lancey is back in town and by word of mouth a game is quickly arranged for the two pro's. Kid's colleague Shooter (Karl Malden) is appointed the trusted dealer, but after an exclusive meeting with a head honcho named Slade (Rip Torn), Shooter is put into a corner and is forced to rig the game.

Meanwhile, when Kid's girl Christian (Tuesday Weld) is out of town visiting her parents, he begins an unsteady relationship with Melba Nile, played by the beautiful Ann-Margret. Joan Blondell rounds out this great assemble as Lady Fingers, a respected card dealer and old friend of Lancey Howard.

"The Cincinnati Kid" is a pretty entertaining movie. Although I don't know anything about the rules of poker, and not absolutely certain if it's imperative for the audience to have a thorough knowledge on, director Norman Jewison is a great substitute for Sam Peckinpah, who was originally slated to direct. Jewison's direction during the showdown between the Kid and the Man is very well done, creating suspense by the clean and natural turn of a card. The soundtrack is also really good here with Lalo Schifrin as the composer. Many viewers have already began to compare this movie with "The Hustler", the classic film about poolsharks made famous by Paul Newman just a few years before. "The Cincinnati Kid" could very well have been made to piggyback that highly acclaimed film.
