Let me begin by saying that I agree with the other viewers' criticism of the box-set itself. It contains no special features, has the same terrible disc-scratching packaging as the past couple of dvd seasons and is notably missing the traditional introduction from Matt Groening.

That being said, I am rating the episodes in this review and am giving this product a 5/5 solely for the quality of the shows (not the container in which they came). This dvd set is worth purchasing just for the episodes. While not every one is an instant classic, as when the Simpsons was in its prime, there are some great ones ("How the Test Was Won" for example). There are also no bad episodes and each one contains many genuinely funny moments. The Simpsons has managed to remain a very good show for over 20 years. In its 450+ episodes, none contain a single embarrassingly unfunny joke (as we often have seen in the last few seasons of Family Guy). Moreover, this is the season where the show began to be broadcast in HD and started to be animated in a widescreen format. As such, it is definitely worth the thirty-something dollars that you would spend on it.
