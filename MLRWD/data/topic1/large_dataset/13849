Scorsese At His Comic Best

 After Hours is one of Scorcese's underrated comedies. One of the first big films in the 80's to compress its entire story as an occurrence a brief, compressed period of time, that being a single - seemingly endless - night in the life of a dreary, over-ordinary word processor. In many regards Scorcese's timing could not be more perfect, coming smack in the middle of the bloated 80's. We meet Paul who seems to be an allegory for entire decade; a boring, intelligent, word processor going nowhere. He meets Marcy and in a matter of hours the seemingly simple quest of "getting home" turns into an eternal nightmare; finally when mistakenly identified as a gay burglar he is chased down by an angry neighborhood mob (the chase also involves a slow-moving Mr. Softee Ice Cream truck). The "after hours" scene at what was earlier the Berlin Club where Paul pulls himself together to dance with a patron to Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is?" is one of cinema's great tragicomic moments.

 Martin assembled an extraordinarily starry cast some of whom appear in roles that last but a moment, and all seem to relish their roles making each a complete and vital character.

 I think what makes this movie so uniquely universal is how many of us have had nights of similar demented dimensions. It's a Wizard of Oz film for the 80's but without any of the help of the fellow Yellow Brick Road gang.

 Give me a big helping of After Hours any day over Gangs of New York!
