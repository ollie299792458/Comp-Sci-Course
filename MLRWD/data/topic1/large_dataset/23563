lord of the flies is one of the best books ever written if not the best.  The movie strangly is just as good as the book, no better no worse.  Its an amazing tale of a bunch of little boys who get stranded on an island and baby THIS AINT GILIGANS ISLAND.  They start out trying to act like their parents would until a plane comes to take them home but things go on for longer than they thought it would and they begin to fight and after a while tribal instincts take over and they get violent.  They have a total complete loss of innocence.  As a matter of fact they have a total loss of civilization (except for one or two characters, who are just trying to keep from getting killed and get home).  Kids stranded on Island, kids miss home, kids forget home, kids go insane...  Its one of those movies that at the end you are left wondering how the children would ever be able to live outside of mental institution walls again and you pretty much gather that the majority will be put in maximum security mental hospitals shortly after coming home because they had totally lost it and you wonder how it is broken to the parents thats children were savagly murdered by their schoolmates.  Its mind trippy.  It will stick with you for the rest of your life...
