There are so many things to love about this film: the music (performed so exquisitely, creating Mozart fans out of folks who thought classical music was boring), the controversial storyline (was Mozart really "murdered"?), and the epic recreation of 18th-century Vienna.  As you fall in love with Mozart and his childlike persona juxtaposed with his musical genius and maturity at such a young age, you can't help but fall in love with the acting genius of F. Murray Abraham.  His character portrayal of Antonio Salieri is, in my humble opinion, the most extraordinary, enigmatic performance ever captured on film. I can't express that enough.  His gestures, his facial expressions, his passion, his overwhelming presence brings Salieri to life and then some.  I think the real Salieiri would be pleased to know he was resurrected in such a larger-than-life manner.  If you're a fan of glorious music, this film will move you.  If you're a fan of Mozart, this film will enrapture you.  If you're a fan of great acting, this film should be your Bible. Abraham won the Best Actor Oscar for this role, and he will forever be revered in the annals of film by this extraordinary performance.  Tom Hulce also did a marvelous job portraying Mozart.  I can't imagine any other actor in the role.  What a treat for the senses.  Bravo!
