I picked up the Americanized Pulse today and the blurb on the back states " the year's most original horror movie," and yes, this was. In 2005 when it came out.

I will be completely honest, technologically this is not a great movie. It is presented like the other j-horror films (Grudge, Dark Water, etc.) in a fairly low budget way; little dialogue, thinly dressed sets, lowkey lighting. Physically there isn't a lot here. It is, however, the most unsettling movie I've seen in a long time.

This movie, like the other original j-horror movies, is all about atmosphere. It is creepy in a way that I thought filmmakers had forgotten, but then the Japanese seem to understand the creepiness necessary for the best ghost stories.

There are no monsters. Nothing jumping out to make you jump without providing any other reason than suprise. No gore or blood.

These are good things.

What the film does though is get in your head and, if you have been paying attention to the world around us it makes you realize how isolated we are making ourselves.

It should go without saying that most Americans won't have a clue what the movie is saying. It seems that if there isn't a monster to heap our scorn and anger on there isn't a plot. Most younger Americans especially will be scratching their heads in bewilderment (look at the other reviews). They have no perspective and if it isn't spoonfed to them it isn't important to know.

As the audience we don't always know or have to understand WHY something is happening to the characters. The characters in the movie don't understand what is happening themselves. They're just trying to survive it, which is what life is mostly like.

This movie made me think about it for days after I watched it which is a sign that it's working.

If you're looking for pretty people in peril and the answers fed to you pick the other one. If you're looking for thoughtful stay with the original japanese versions.
