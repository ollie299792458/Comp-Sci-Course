The 1975-6 season of Doctor Who is one of the most popular, despite the fact that almost every story that features within it pays homage and liberally borrows from cinema. Viewed today we can see this season as being an example of a post-modern appropriation, but at this time post-modern theory was in its total infancy. Doctor Who was once again forging ahead and showing its innovation where other programmes lagged behind.  The reference point for HAND OF FEAR can be taken as far back as the 1926 with ORLACS HANDE directed by ROBERT WEINE who a few years before had also directed THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI. His film was remade twice first as MAD LOVE and then the British horror HANDS OF ORLAC, which I like to think is the purer reference that Bob Baker and Dave Martin had in mind. Like a good many Doctor Who stories the first two episodes are excellent. Some wonderful use of location work adds a reality to the story that a cheap BBC set would only have undermined. The hand is an extremely effective special effect and Elisabeth Sladen in her swansong is given much more to than usual. Her trance like state is genuinely chilling and well played. Sadly things take a downward turn when the action moves to Kastria. And the final episode is especially disappointing, Stephen Thorne's overacting is hilarious to behold and on one occasion you can see Baker and Sladen visibly trying not to burst out laughing. This all adds to the enjoyment however. As a finale for Sarah Jane HAND OF FEAR does seem somewhat dissatisfying, but the opening two episodes are as good as any in Tom Baker's long tenure as the Doctor.
