Castle gets better every season! The writting, the plot, the actor's chemistry...
Stana Katic(Beckett, the detective turned moonlighting muse.) and Nathan Fillion(The titular Castle, our crime-fighting writer.) are better than ever, with the writers mixing comedy and seriousness along with a growing relationship to give us the best season to date. Although it's a fun show and can be appreciated by both the casual watcher and the avid Caskett fan, the writers skillfully craft inside jokes for those who have been with the series from the beginning(where Castle and Beckett are often stuck in similar situations and are forced try the shoe on the other foot.) or even followed the actors' careers for years(Castle dresses up as "a space cowboy" to which his daughter retorts "weren't you that like five years ago?" referencing his time as Captain Malcom Reynolds on "Firefly" and in "Serenity" the show and subsequent movie with a SciFi cult following.)
Whether you like crime dramas, shows fraught with sexual tension or a excellent drama capable of giving you a good laugh, Castle is sure to please.
