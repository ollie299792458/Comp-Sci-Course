Darn shame the system only has five stars maximum. I want to give this movie more. Maybe ten. Maybe it's because I'm a baby boomer and aging hippie, but this touched me very, very deeply. I'm sure I've annoyed my room-mate wearing the earphones and singing along with the songs.

Lucy, an American girl, and Jude, a British lad from Liverpool, are the couple at the center of the story. But Sadie's there, and Prudence, and a most artful weaving of Beatles songs into a relatively coherent story. And anything done during that period has to be a little incoherent anyway in order to be authentic.

I'm going to be a brat and not tell you hardly anything of the story. But I will say that you will recognize how well the songs fit, and how well other elements from the same era fit, including one character that will remind you of Janis Joplin, and another that will remind you of Jimi Hendrix. There are some artful touches, like the choreographed ballet with the soldiers and the nearly naked inductees at the draft board. The cops that break up an anti-war demonstration are singing.

This is a unique concept in story-telling, and I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it. Anyone who hasn't seen it is highly recommended to do so at the earliest opportunity. And if you are over 40, you will probably not be able to resist singing along.
