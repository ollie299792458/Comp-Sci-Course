I find this Rodney Yee DVD simply wonderful, as my title says.

I'm not into power yoga nor am I much of an athlete.  As someone who's been doing yoga for about one year, I find this a good workout: not too intense and not too easy.  Just right (for me).

Other reviewers say the moves are VERY slow, but I don't think they are.  In total contrast to the other reviewers, I wish it was even slower.  But this is how I like to do yoga.  I feel I should stress that: this is how I like to do yoga.

The reason I wrote that sentence twice is because I think reviews of "workouts" are HIGHLY subjective.  Many people write how good this or that DVD is without mentioning that it's to their taste.

I have purchased more than a few yoga and dance DVDs that I simply do not like because of things like the music or the instructors' voice.

I like this DVD on all levels.  I like the gentle new-age music.  I like the sound of Rodney Yee's voice.  I like that it doesn't feel or sound like a "workout". What it looks like, I haven't really noticed, and I really dont care about that, because I usually just listen.

I really like that this DVD is quiet and fairly slow without being too easy.  It's hard to find that mix.
