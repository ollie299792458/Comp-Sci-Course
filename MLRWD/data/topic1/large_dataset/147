A truly PERFECT film, "thirtysomething" director Edward Zwick's portrait of the 54th Massachusetts history-making entry into the Civil War is breaktaking in every way.  If you've never seen "Glory" on the  big screen, then you've never really seen it!  The cinematograpy is  outstanding, as are performances by Matthew Broderick and Andre Braugher  (of "Homicide: Life on the Street").  The true star of the film,  however, is Denzel Washington.  Seeming to electrify every scene in which  he appears, his performance as the angry runaway slave Trip more than  deserved the Oscar it earned him.  The scene is which Trip (Washington) is  whipped is destined to become a classic in film history, as is the assault  on Fort Wagner in the movie's climax. Also, don't underestimate the  importance of a movie's score.  The other stars of this film are the Boys  Choir of Harlem, whom we hear throughout the film and perfectly compliment  the mood sought for each scene. In short, "Glory" is my favorite  film.  Upon watching, it's not hard to understand why.
