Il Postino is one of my top two or three movies. It is just so beautiful any way you look at it, and it has actually helped to make a change in my life.
Il Postino is about Mario, a mailman who has problems expressing himself. Of course, he has fallen in love with the local beauty and can't show it. Luckily for Mario, the Nobel-winning Chilean poet Pablo Neruda has been exiled to his island and can help Mario in his endeavors.
The real beauty in Il Postino isn't this "Cyrano de Bergerac" story, though. This movie is about the poetic depths that Neruda inpires Mario to reach for (Il Postino is really the visual form of Neruda's poem "Poetry"). He inspires Mario to write. He inspires him to recognize the beauty of the world around him. He inspires Mario to think about the people around him and to work to help them. He inspires Mario to see the wonder of love. In short, Neruda, through poetry, teaches Mario how to love life and how to express that love.
Il Postino has done for me pretty much what Neruda did for Mario in the movie. This brilliant movie can inspire a love of life and a love of poetry. I strongly recommend this movie for anyone who loves movies or literature. It is well acted, well written, and very though provoking. I also urge that people not be scared off by the fact that it is a foreign film. The subtitles are well-done, and I never really notice that I am reading the movie. Also, everything in this movie is applicable to any persons life no matter where they come from. Il Postino is a real joy.
