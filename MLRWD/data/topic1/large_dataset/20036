As A Brit,I fully appreciate that this is an American film, but people in the UK have always seen it as "our movie", mainly because of the original true story I suppose. That's not surprising, as this is such an exhilarating stirring and inspiring film, watching it would make even the most cynical person proud to be British.(watching it as a kid made me want to join the RAF when I grew up!)  Such a great cast - Steve McQueen obviously steals the show, but my favorite performance is Donald Pleasance as Colin, and his deeply moving portrayal of a man going blind. And so many great classic scenes! My favourites are Gordon Jackson forgetting to say "danke" instead of "thanks" before he boards the bus, Charles Bronson mentally cracking up when the tunnel collapses on him, David McCallum's heroic death on the railway track after saving Richard Attenborough from the S.S., Donald Pleasance doing the "pin-trick" to prove he can still see, the shocking final fate of The 50 - the list is endless.  I can watch this film a kazillion times and never tire of how great it is. If you've never seen this classic, do yourself a favour and buy it now.
