I never get tired of this adaptation of the Louisa May Alcott book. Winona Ryder plays Jo to perfection. The performance WAS worthy of an Oscar. Kirsten Dunst surprised me, giving off more acting range than previously expected. Her spoiled Amy is one of the characters that make the movie what it is. And Claire Danes as Beth was perfectly cast. The scene where Beth dies is so perfect because you find yourself in there with Jo, hiding from the thunder and turning to see Beth's probably dead body. That sounds so insensitive, but how else could I put it? Even as Jo says she hates Amy for burning her manuscript, she saves Amy from the ice-cold water and we feel the love these sisters all share. In the beginning, Meg is serious and composed. In the end, she's serious and composed yet still full of love and sense. Jo is a mischievous writer in the beginning. By the end, she is mature and realizing that she has much to learn. Beth never loses an inch of her genuine kindness, and it's sad to see her die. Amy is a spoiled little girl, and by the time the credits roll she's been to Europe and she's married and happy. These transformations are so believable that this movie will never feel old, and you'll be sucked right in to watch it all unfold before your eyes. An excellent film that should have gotten several Oscars.
