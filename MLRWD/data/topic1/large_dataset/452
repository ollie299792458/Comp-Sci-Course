Modanna has created two movies in one.  One a masterpiece and the second a soap opera that looks like a bad made for TV cable battered wife film.  The Masterpece is the romance of Wallace for Edward . A stunning period piece lead by Andrea Riseborough.  Ms. Riseborough makes Wallace a women you can't take your eyes off of. Wallace says she is not a beauty, but delivers the allusion of beauty by clothing and presence.  That is 100% true of Riseborough performanc. When she is on the screen this movie is impossible to turn away from. Unfortunally when the other story line is on the screen all you want is the romote controle to change the channel. Bad Script, bad acting and nothing to make it worth your time.  But even as bad as the modern story line is ; this is a film not to be missed, but only for the Wallace and Edward parts......so suffer through the other half ....it is well worth the troble to see Ms. Riseborough performance.  Her "Twist " dance at the end is charming and funny and heartbreaking all at one! She gets the 4 stars for her Wallace!  A women a king could not live without!
