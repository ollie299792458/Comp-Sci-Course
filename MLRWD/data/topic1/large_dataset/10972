I was really excited when I rented this movie. I thought it would be interesting, informative, and an in-depth look at a famous psychotic, Mark David Chapman. Unfortunately, this movie offered none of these things. All it did was span the 3 days prior to Lennon's murder through the eyes of Chapman (Jared Leto). It gave no real background of Chapman's life before he came to NY, except that he had a super-Christian wife and used to live in Hawaii.  As for the Catcher in the Rye references, they were mundane and weak, a simple throwing in of some flash-backs to fields of rye as some poor attempt at visual artistic metaphor. The film kept pushing the same facts over and over for an hour and a half. Yes, he was crazy. Yes, he lived alone and was homicidal and obsessive. But why? I wanted more, some delving into his mind, some history to the man. why did he commit the murder? was he always this way? how did he become a fan of the Beatles in the first place? was there any family conflict or a bad childhood that created this monster? all these questions and more are ignored and instead, the audience is served a cold helping of superficial cinema that barely scratches the surface of this world-reknown, earth-shattering event: the murder of a Beatle. I could have just watched the Discovery channel and learned more and not have had to suffer Lindsey Lohan's attempt at being a serious actor. Blah.
