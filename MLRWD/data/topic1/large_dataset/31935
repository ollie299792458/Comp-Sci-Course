The Eagles perform a great collection of songs - and not just Eagles songs; there are a few Don Henley and Joe Walsh songs in here too.  They play their major hits.  Eagles hits such as "The Long Run", "Peaceful Easy Feeling", "Tequila Sunrise" and many more are here, as well as Don Henley hits ("The Boys Of Summer", "Dirty Laundry", and more) and Joe Walsh hits ("Rocky Mountain Way", "Life's Been Good", and more).  They put on a good show, and they're fun to watch.

Video & camera work: The video is very clear and crisp.  The focus is mainly on the band, as I think it should be, with occasional views of the enthusiastic crowd.  Occasional close-ups of individual band members from various angles are also included, and is done very well.  Overall, the video and camera work is excellent.

The sound is good, too.  I only have a stereo sound setup, but I have no complaints on the sound.

This is one of the best concert videos I have seen.  The overall combination of a great set of songs, along with the camera work and video quality, makes this a great choice if you're an Eagles/Don Henley/Joe Walsh fan.
