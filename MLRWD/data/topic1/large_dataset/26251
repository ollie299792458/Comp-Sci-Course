Right before I was lulled into unconciousness by the flamenco guitar/piano soundtrack, I knew when I came to I should jot down a couple of lines about this opus. Ed Wood fans sing his praises on high but who carries the torch for Ron Ormond? Indeed, this film is a virtual who's who for Wood fans. Delores Fuller pops up,  Lyle Talbot narrates (one of the greatest non-Wood rants ever penned), and Wood even recycled that comfortably numb soundtrack for "Jailbait". But the real wonder here is Harmon Stevens as Leland Masterson. From the get-go, when Stevens is on the screen you can't take your eyes off him. In particular a sequence at a sleazy Mexican dive when Masterson/Stevens is sitting at a table across from Doreen Culbertson/Paula. This is one of longest zombie grins in film history this side of the father in "Eraserhead" during the dinner sequence. Yes, Uncle Fester(Jackie Coogan) is on hand as the mastermind behind it all but he turns in an Academy award performance in comparison to the others. The inanity does slow a bit about half way through but bad movie lovers can't go wrong with this. How about Ormond's "Monster and The Stripper" AKA "The Exotic Ones"... any word on its DVD release?
