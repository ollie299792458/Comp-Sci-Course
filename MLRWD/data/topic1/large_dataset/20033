In an excellent adaptation of the novel, "Exodus" by Leon Uris, this movie gives us an interesting look back at the birth of Israel.

The movie opens as a boat filled with European refugees arrives and is sent to a refugee camp in Cyprus.

Paul Newman plays Ben Canaan. He has a plan to take the entire group of refugees that has just arrived and lead them to Israel. The U.N. is about to vote on the Israel/Palestine partician and escaping with a boat filled with Jews, many who have suffered under Hitler's programs to eliminate the Jewish religion, will create world-wide publicity.

Eva Marie Saint portrays Kitty Freemont, who is visiting General Sutherland, portrayed by Ralph Richardson. Kitty's husband was a news photographer and was killed the year before while on assignment in Israel.  Now, Kitty doesn't seem to have a meaning to her life and Gen. Sutherland proposes that since she is a trained nurse, she help out at the refugee camp.

At the camp, Kitty meets a young Jewish girl and becomes fond of in a motherly fashion. Her goal becomes to help this girl, move from the camp so that Kitty could take her to America to go to school and possibly be adopted by Kitty.

Once the refugees arrive in Israel, the setting was well done, with the arid area and the views of the Jewish youth camp in Israel. We
see the spitit and bravery of the young Jewish settlers.

Newman's voice was felt as a moderate wanting Jewish settlers and their Arab neighbors to live in peace and work together. He makes the viewer wonder what the world would have been like today, if only his dreams of peaceful co-existence could have been met.

The music that accompanied the movie was excellent with a military type of sound that went with the accomplishments of the settlers.

Highly recommended.
