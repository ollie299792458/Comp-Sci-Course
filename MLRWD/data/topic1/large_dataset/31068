This is probably the most democratic movie ever made.  All you have to do to make one equally glorious is dig up a diving helmet, a gorilla suit, a suitable hill near LA, and some other junk you might find lying by the road, toss in some normal conversation and some classic moral dilemma dialogue, and you have a movie.  This movie is what makes cinema accessible to the common man.  There is no liberal moralizing or conservative patriotism to muddle the raw human experience of confronting a robot that looks like what you or the creepy kid next door might envision a real robot monster from outer space would look like.  No high-paid intellectual snobs writing lines that insult your intelligence, no way.  But the plot carries you along.  Are the last surviving humans going to be obliterated by the robot monster?  And even if they do survive, what's that kid going to do for a wife since the robot monster killed the little girl?  Oh well, she was a big pain anyway.  Maybe the grownups will have some more kids, hopefully good-looking polite girls with no recessive genes.  But I digress.  Every person who really loves the real Hollywood needs to see this movie as often as possible.
