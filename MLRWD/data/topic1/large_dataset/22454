This concert is one of the saddest Rock and Roll events I have ever witnessed. Not because the band is not playing well- they are. But every moment is tinged with the sadness of having lost a great friend, and our realization that a wonderful rock and roll personality has been removed from the world. John  Entwistle died from taking cocaine, and by all standards that was a stupid act of selfishness. Leaving his mates in the lurch in the middle of a tour- John, John, John, defintely bad form at best. The pain, the sadness is evident in every closeup, between the songs, and in the music itself. Listen to Townsend's tortured guitar licks and Daltry's strangled singing and you will know this is a group of friends in deep mourning. The music though is fantastic, even though they occasionally get out of synch, particularly Zak Starkey, but it doesn't matter. Anything on this night that might be a mistake is forgiven by their fans, and at times the music soars and reaches the heights seen and heard by Who fans in years past when the sound of The Who roared like a lion in the jungle. And like the Lion, The Who are still the Kings of The Rock and Roll world, and even in death will continue to reign.
