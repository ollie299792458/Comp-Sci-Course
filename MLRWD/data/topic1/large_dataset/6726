Space:1999 was a classic sci-fi series of the 1970's, and now we have all of the episodes available to us in a convenient set.

Though the 1st season was more thoughtful and had somewhat better effects, the second season does have some very good episodes to be remebered. Its too bad that the quality and ratings dropped too fast for this to have remained on the air as a quality show.

The best epsiodes of this show, such as "Mission of the Darians",
"Another Time, Another place" are right up there with the best of
Star Trek: Original Series.

Unfortunately, though it took hard work to create some of the models and sets for these shows, some of them already started looking a bit cheezy by the time the show made it to the air, and this is only exacerbated on later watching now. However, the good writing and acting, as well as the 'atmosphere' created by these effects usually allows me to not be too distracted by some of the more primitive effects.

I highly recommend this, whether you are a new fan or old.
One thing: if it comes out in a new version with better visual and audio, get that instead.
