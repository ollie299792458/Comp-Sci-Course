Fargo is a truly great modern-classic.  Frances McDormand is touching with her old-fashioned values amongst all the violence and greed of the other characters.  William H. Macy is able to gain our sympathies, even after all the horrible events that unfold.  He wasn't a bad guy, just stupid.  Steve Buscemi is hilarious and perfect playing a weasily little man "Wow, Daddy."  Peter Stormare is brutal, and very much resembling an angel of death when he walks from his car after the accident.  And to think that such cold, introverted people exist among is is chilling.  Also, the Coen brothers casting of actors who look average is also very effective, not only in the main roles, but small parts too.  The man who tells the police officer information on Steve Buscemi is hilarious in his natural, average demeanor.  And instead of picking a conventionally gorgeous woman to be placed in the flipped-over car, the Coen's pick a woman with a kind of average prettiness, that's much more powerful because she is like people we know, and we can see her having a family and friends who would miss her.  The music, also, is wonderfully sad and moving.  Fargo is not a comedy, but it is a kind of joke, and when watching it one must remember that the Coens are probably laughing at every scene, even if we are not.

Also, the family who thinks Fargo is the worst movie ever, and when discussing bad movies says: "but is it FARGO bad?!?!" must be the biggest bunch of dumbasses in the world.  Please stop watching movies, and if that is too much to ask, please, please stop polluting the internet.

But yeah, Fargo is very good.  May take a few viewings to appreciate fully, so worth buying definitely.
