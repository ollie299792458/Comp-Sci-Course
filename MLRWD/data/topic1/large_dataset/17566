One word can really describe this movie finally being coded to DVD, AWSOME.  I remember being in High School when this movie was released in 1989.  I saw it then and was stunned by such a movie of high calibur.  Now  it being released to DVD format with restored footage, this clearly  explains many questions we might have had when we saw it the first time  around.  After you watch the making of this movie, you come to realize that  the actors were very underpaid to do this type of difficult movie. 
  If you have not seen this movie of true underwater adventure, then you do  not know what you are missing.  No other underwater movie tops what this  movie created.  It is hard to believe that many of the ideas in this movie  were very plausible.  For example the florocarbon oxygenated water that  they use in the movie, you breathe in, instead of air is the actual stuff  in the scene with the rat.  
  This movie shows and points out that  are possibly being observed by aliens.  But why do they not contact us?  Why do they just sit back and observe?  Because all they have to do is view  our history as a violent world (wars, genocide, etc) to make them wary of  contact.  In reality there are areas of the ocean to this day that we  cannot penetrate and see.  Who knows what might be down there.  This movie  will show you one possible encounter.  This DVD is also jam packed with so  much content you will literally spend hours pouring over storyboards, and  information.  This is how DVD's should be made and how others should be  molded.
