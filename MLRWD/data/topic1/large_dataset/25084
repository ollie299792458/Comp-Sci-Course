In a press conference shortly after the release of Psycho, a journalist asked Hitchcock, "Mr. Hitchcock, my daughter saw Diabolique and refuses to take baths. Now she's seen Psycho and refuses to take showers. It's become a problem. What do suggest I do?" Hitchcock replied: "Send her to the dry cleaners." It must have galled Hitch to have lost out to Henri Clouzot in making this film. It is right up his alley as a classic suspense film.

Suffice to say Diabolique is a creepy little thriller that sticks with you long after you've seen it. In fact, it never actually leaves your mind. Decay and decadence permeates the boys' school grounds. You know in advance that no good will come of this.

The acting is superb, and this film is rightfully remembered as one of Simone Signoret's best performances as the world weary hussy schoolmarm. Vera Clouzot is multi-layered as the put-upon, frazzled wife. Both women are riveting.

Buy it. Turn down the lights. See if you don't jump.
