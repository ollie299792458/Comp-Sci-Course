hi guys and gals, i think its about time these things have to be said. i am absoluteley sick and tired of watching so called movie directors with a thousand years of experience and all the money in the world producing so much tv trash. This movie is yet another example of weak plot bulked up with, predictable so called "jumpy" moments, i found myself contemplating suicidal thoughts at several points in this move, feelings i have't felt sinse watching sleepy hollow. The poor plot was  backed up with an even more amazingly boring ending, this movie could make members of the "watching paint drying asociation" wanna cut their wrists. Im sorry, some of you may have liked this movie, but also , im sure all 3 of you probably have a history of self harming and probably also have lifetime memberships to paint drying monthly. Needless to say, if your bored and need a movie to absolutley rip the mickey out of, yes this is for you my friend. So there you have it, if choose to ignore my advice and actually rent or god forbid buy this cinematic turd, i can only advise u pre-book the ambulance to pick you up around ten minutes after the beginning of the movie as you are quite likely to have topped yourself. happy viewing!!!!!!
