The Criterion Collection DVD of this, one of the greatest comedies of all time (and one of my ten favorite movies), is a long-awaited and vast improvement over the previously available DVD version of the film.  The sound is far clearer, and the picture is crisp and sharp.  It is nice to be able to enjoy the movie without having to forgive hisses, pops, and picture skips.
DVD extras in the Criterion edition are fairly extensive -- a radio version of the show, a short but good-natured blooper reel, the theatrical trailer (which was not restored to the pristine picture and sound of the movie), and an unintentionally amusing commentary in which a film scholar laboriously explains every joke as though his mission was to drive a stake through the heart of the movie.  The movie is more than good enough to survive its mind-cudgeling analysis, but the commentary is eminently skippable.
No matter, though.  The extras are not the reason to buy the Criterion edition of My Man Godfrey anyway -- it is the stellar quality of the movie itself, finally presented the way it ought to be seen.
