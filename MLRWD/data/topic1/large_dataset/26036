In her last Oscar nominated role, Audrey Hepburn brings her role as Susie Hendrix to life in this thrilling film brought together by Hitchcock influence. 
Susie is learning to adapt to her blindness, which resulted from a recent auto accident, she recieves help from Gloria, a girl who lives in the upstairs appartment &amp; her loving photographer husband, Sam. Sam who does a great deal of traveling in his line of business, excepts a doll as a favor to a young woman, on his way home from Canada. He takes it home deciding to give it to a child in the hospital only to have it dissapear. 
But what Sam &amp; Susie don't know is that the doll is actually filled with small packets of herion &amp; that a murderous drug dealer (Alan Arkin) will stop at nothing to get his hands on the doll. He inlists two con-men (Richard Crenna &amp; Jack Weston) to help him trick Susie into handing the doll over while posing as policemen &amp; Sam's friends. The plot thickins as Susie begins to realize the truth behind the criminals &amp; turns her weakness into a powerful strength. 
Many claim that the movie is a pathetic excuse for a horror &amp; that the movie isn't at all scary but I guess they consider films like Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream, &amp; Halloween scary because of the cheap scares &amp; gore. But if your not hooked on the slasher genre you should watch this classic, &amp; try watching it in the dark, if you don't scare easy.
