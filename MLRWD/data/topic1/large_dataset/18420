In looking at the reviews, it's obvious most people are are going to love this movie or hate it...count me among those who loved it.  For me, this is Woody's best film since "Match Point". This movie was such an unexpected surprise...one of the few movies I've ever seen that I didn't want to end.  I wanted more of Owen Wilson's character, "Gil" interacting with the Fitzgeralds, Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Dali, et al.  I'm not a huge Owen Wilson fan, but this is one of the best, if not THE best, movies he's ever done.  If you think the idea of time traveling back to the Roaring 20's of Paris for an evening to meet F.Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Pablo Picasso, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas, Dali and the like is a terrible idea for a movie, and you don't appreciate Paris as a city of romance, do yourself a favor and skip this movie.  (For those reading this review who have already seen the movie, I keep thinking that the Rachel McAdams character and her parents would HATE this film, which earns it my highest praise;)  The rest of you sit back, relax and enjoy the ride!
