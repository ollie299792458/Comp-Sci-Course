Deranged is a well filmed and well articulated classic. It shows great insight to a murderers mind. The acting is phenomenal. It doesn't use gore and cheap thrills to send one's heart racing. It relies on it's own terror. Afterall what is creepier than a necrophiliac. Ezra Cobb is a deeply troubled man which makes a deeply troubled story and a fascinating horror movie all in one. It is the perfect movie to turn out the lights grab a person you love and hold onto them tight, for if you don't who knows what might get you, this film is truly creepy, and made like a documentary which makes it feel so real. It is not a movie to watch alone.
Motel Hell is on the reverse side of the disc. It is a true dark comedy. I laughed throughout most of it. It somewhat reminded me of Rocky Horror. A bizzare place out in the middle of nowhere, and people constantly stranded, but the secret garden is the best part. The ending will leave you laughing. The acting is great. If they ever remade this movie i would love to star in it. It is that great. So watch Motel Hell you'll enjoy every moment of it. Especially if you love horror movies.
