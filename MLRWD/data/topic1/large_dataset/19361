I am absolutely hooked on this DVD collection.  If you are a beginner, they might be a little challenging, and you will definitely be sore, but even if you can't complete the entire workout, after practicing a few times, you'll get stronger and more flexible and be able to do it!  I have been doing beginner pilates for a few years, and bought these because I wanted to step it up a notch.  I found exactly what I was looking for!  Each DVD is about 30 minutes, broken up into 4 or 5 sections the first always being the warm up and the last always shape by stretch.  Because the workout are broken up, the time flies.  The moves are small but precise, and really work!  I have only been doing it for two weeks and already feel stronger and more energetic, and can see a more slender, toned shape in the mirror.  I look forward to these workouts, and do one of them 4-6 times a week.  I highly recommend them for any woman looking to get lean legs, slimmer waist, flat abs, strong slender arms, and a toned backside!!!
