Well, there are no words. For those of you who grew up watching Leave It To Beaver, and loved watching the adventures of the Cleaver family, here it is. Volume One, with cuteness abounding. These shows were really evidence of a more simple, charming age, when families actually talked at the dinner table, and mom and dad had no other interests but that of their children, keeping them out of trouble,and making sure they ate their brussel spouts ("brussel spouts" is a hilarious episode!)
I still get a kick out of June vacuuming in a dress, high heels and pearls. Seriously, this is one of the best TV shows around, and Wally and The Beaver are funny, sincere, innocent, and, just boys. You will love, as I did, "Captain Jack", as the boys send away for a baby alligator (honest!) and feed it with milk, eggs, and cooking sherry. You will truly love the pure charm and simplicity of these episodes. Also, the high moral tone set by the show, always helping the boys understand about doing the right thing, and avoiding what was wrong or hurtful to others. I urge you to buy it, you will definitely finish watching with a big smile on your face!!
