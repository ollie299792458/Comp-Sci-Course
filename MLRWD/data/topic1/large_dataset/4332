First off,

You losers writing about the inaccuracies of the movie as compared to the book need to get a life.  Nobody cares if the score of the Dallas Carter game was "technically" different in real life. Im sure if your anal enough(and have enough time on your hands) you can find innacuracies in 'Hoosiers" and "Miracle".

Second,

Even the director(Peter Berg) and the book writer mention in the dvd commentary the select few scenes in the movie that were different from the book and different from real life.  The overall intent of the movie was to relay the real-life theme of Odessa and that Permian team during the "88" season, not list what was said by each player word for word.

Last,

Obviously the movie was great, not because its based on a true story but because its not shot as every other sports movie out there.  It was shot like a real life documentary which adds to the reality of the whole situation.  Derek Luke is 100% believable and Billy Bob did a brilliant job of portraying the real life situations that the Permian coach faced during the season(boosters, injuries, the media).  I also loved the Roy Williams cameo as the Midland Lee coach, it was hillarious.
