Picked this up on Blu-Ray tonight.  I had seen it several years ago and it's one of my wife's favorites, so we bought it at Mart du Wal for cheap.  The original film story line and quality were very good for the budget and the actors turn in solid performances (Bill Paxton is a riot, and Lance Henriksen, Tim Thomerson, and Adrian Pasdar are personal faves).  What I particularly liked:  (1) This is a vampire movie where the term "vampire" isn't used once and (2) vampirism in this wee corner of the cinematic universe is reversible:  refreshing, if farfetched.  Scoring and effects could have been better but, you know...

Anyway, about the Blu-Ray:  The Lions Gate 'Near Dark' Blu-Ray has the distinction of being the first faulty Blu-Ray I've ever purchased - and I've purchased a few hundred at this point.  Transfer quality did not appear to be much better than a decent DVD (I'm watching this through an Oppo BDP-483 onto a Samsung 62-inch DLP) and the worst part:  there was an artifact line about 1/4 of the way down the screen that stayed on the screen for better than 90-percent of the picture.  It was most noticeable during dark scenes (hey, we're talking VAMPIRE movie here...).  The artifact was a series of sporadic dots, all on one horizontal line.  Not present in the preview, splash, special features, or menu screens, solely on the feature.  Not good.  Mine's going back to Walmart for exchange.  Hopefully the next one will be better.  If it repeats, it goes back for refund and we'll downgrade to DVD.  Lions Gate, your BD production contractors have dissed you.  An acceptable light twist on vampire fare, but watch the QC on the Blu-Ray.
