Ok, I hardly EVER write reviews on this site (or any for that matter, cause I just don't believe people on the Internet really care about other people's opinions, especially about movies) but this movie is fantastic and I really just wanted to put that quote in the subject line. If you, as an American, appreciate British humor, you will love Hot Fuzz; if you don't, you won't, it's a simple as that. It's not a SPOOF! There's an original story here. The filmakers did want to pay tribute to all the great buddy cop movies over the year, and they wanted to give it a British twist since there's never been a (good) British cop movie. I for one, thought Hot Fuzz was BETTER than Shaun of the Dead, as least as far as production values go. It clearly has a bigger budget, the cinematography is better, and it's generally a cleaner, cleaner looking film all around. The sound is ridiculously good on a solid home entertainment system. Do yourself a favor, go pick this one up, and enjoy it on the best format available for years to come.
