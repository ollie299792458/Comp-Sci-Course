I have seen this movie roughly 50 times.  It was only a week ago when I was able to watch the movie on DVD instead of my VHS tape, and let me tell you, it is an amazing difference!  It was like seeing the movie for the  first time!  So clear and bright and crisp, like a DVD should be.  It added  even more to an amazing film.
The music is what makes this film  wonderful, and I especially like the acting, although others seem to think  it is not acted well.  I enjoy hard-lined Sci-Fi movies, and this is one of  them....I hate junk and garbage like Xena, Hercules, or Dragonheart - all  those really, really bad Fantasy movies...this one permeates the viewer  with a "Wagneresque" taste, superbly acted by a superb cast.  Gabriel Byrne plays an awesome Uther, Liam Nieson in his first film, and  Patrick Stewart sports the bulging guns and actual hair!  (well some hair)  
The movie takes liberty with the tales and history, but it is serious  and moving, and conveys everything a good Arthur tale should.
