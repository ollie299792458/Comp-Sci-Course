It seemed that I had already read the script before I saw this because every single moment in the movie was just plain obvious. You know she's going to turn back into a 13 year old teen at the end of the movie. You know she is gonna fall in love with that one guy. It's just so easy to figure out. Of course there is going to be a girl bully with her "Popular" friends trying to cheat the younger girl out. It's just so plain and simple.

Let me name a few movies that are exactly like this:

.Mean Girls

.Teenage Drama Queen

.Freaky Friday [Freaky Friday is totally identical to this]

.Lizzy Maguire

.Uptown Girl

And as you know, these are all Chick-flicks so who am I to say these are painful 90 minutes that leave you in Agony. And of course the Parents always say "Oh yeah, I've been there before." "Then why don't you make a movie of it!!!". I know I sound like I should be in a mental hispital but still, this movie is just a waste of time and money. I mean, I don't understand who would pay 20 bucks to see this filth.

Please do not buy this. Only if you are a girly-girl with her girly friends who are shopping at the mall and want to see a movie like this or if you "Have been there" and want to re-live the bright and tear-dropping "Good old days". This movie is trash and it just it to obvious. You'd think so too if you have seen all of the movies I have listed above.

So I'd give it 1 out of 10. Do not buy!
