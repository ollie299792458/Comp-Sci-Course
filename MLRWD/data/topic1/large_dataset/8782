War is hell, and civil war forces horrific tensions between blood relations, ideology, and sacrifice.  This is a violent, emotional, yet realistic and important portrayal of the Korean War, seen from a ground-level point of view.  Yes there were patriots, anti-communists, and valiant warriors, but mostly there were brothers, children, parents...and they fought or hid to survive.

I spent seven years in Korea during the transition from military leaders to democratically elected civilian rule.  Taeguki struck me as a well-done historic film, done as well as Hollywood might have.

Comparisons have been made with Saving Private Ryan, so I'll join and say that Taeguki had more grit, faster pacing, deeper emotional draw, and just seemed more real.  SPR had the money to make more graphic and realistic battle scenes, but Taeguki's war scenes were powerful enough that my wife had to tell me at one point, "Relax...it's not you that's fighting!"

Bottom-line:  Excellent movie, well worth seeing--especially those with an interest in Korea.  I watched the Korean-language version, with English subtitles and found it easy to follow.  The English dubbed edition seemed to be well-done (I watched about 10 minutes of it), but there is always something lost when movies are dubbed.
