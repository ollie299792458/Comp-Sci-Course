I ordered this video after first seeing it on the TBN Cable Network.  I was so impressed that I wanted to have my own copy, for more careful "start-and-stop" personal viewing and also to share with family and friends.  I enthusiastically recommend it -- for its educational value in astronomy and Bible history, but also (much more importantly) as another piece of evidence that the Bible can be trusted as a book containing God's truth!

It is an illustrated presentation by Frederick Larson, a lawyer (not an astronomy expert), who has been rewarded with very amazing findings -- resulting from diligent research effort (using careful Bible-study and historical analysis, plus sophisticated astronomy-projection computer-simulation programs), combined with "outside-the-box" thinking.

Traditional scholarly dating of events associated with the Bible's account of the Star of Bethlehem's appearance (in the 5 B.C. to 1 B.C. period) causes many learned "experts" to question Mr. Larson's conclusions.  However, the past astronomical events he has discovered (by going backward in time with the mathematically-precise astronomy software) certainly prove that the "behavior" ascribed to the Star in the Bible is both explainable and consistent with known natural and observable appearances of stars and planets, when viewed from a fixed position on a rotating and orbiting earth!
