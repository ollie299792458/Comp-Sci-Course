Friday Night Lights may be the best book to movie translation that I've ever seen.  This is not an easy task given how many rich themes are explored in the book.  Nonetheless, with the standards set high, this movie manages to capture the essence of the book and Bissinger's riveting window into the world of Texas high school football.  The movie follows Permian high school through their 1988 season as they hope to "Win State," but the story is really about:

- The religion that is Texas high school football; the worshiping of star players

- The relationship between players and their parents/fans hoping to relive their glory days

- The sense of hope and identity that high school football gives to people

- The lack of hope that most players have once their playing days are over

- The lack of education that star football players get

- The racial tensions in small town western Texas

- The pressure on the players and the coaches to win

The brilliance of this movie is that it manages to capture all of this in 118 minutes.
