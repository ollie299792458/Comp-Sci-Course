Let me explain.This is most likely pure,undiluted conjecture on my part,but I get the feeling that some of the dodgier elements of the first "Batman" film were due to studio interference:the tentative nature of the Joker,the weak leading lady(nothing against Kim Basinger at all,she just doesn't belong in a Burton film)and the contrived romance between Vicky Vale and Bruce Wayne.Bruce is a character who would be drawn to more than looks,and unfortunately that's all Vale's character offers.And let's just mention Robert Wuhl.All this seemed to be the studios way of taking Burton's original vision,which was probably much darker and more caustic,and making it more palatable to a summer audience.And if my estimation of Burton as an artist is accurate,he probably bristles fiercely at such interference.And so we have,"Batman Returns",which retains the florid atmosphere of the first one,all grand,decaying Gothic austerity offset with fun-house thrills,and completely buries all sense of compromise(having a film become one of the biggest money-makers of all time gives you that privelege).Opening with a smashingly designed and executed sequence,we see the origins of the Penguin,(Danny DeVito)from his birth to wealthy parents,who leave him floating in the sewer because of his grotesque deformaties.The scene is as sad and haunting as any in Burton's work.Next we meet Max Shreck,played to absolute perfection by Christopher Walken,a shady business Tycoon,who has Gotham City wrapped around his evil little finger.His assistant,Selina Kyle,(Michelle Pfieffer)who when we first meet her is a mousy wallflower,is in on his shady dealings,involving a scheme to monopolize Gotham's power supply.He finds out she's on to him,and pushes her out a window,ostensibly killing her.But she survives,having been "rescued" by a horde of stray cats.But there's something decidedly different about her as she goes home and transforms her self into the Catwoman.Pfieffer is a righteous,fired-up marvel as the sexy,lethal Catwoman,and she seems to have a ball,finding the wounded pride and swaggering confidence of the character.It's a grand,unforgettable performance.Pfieffer certainly makes a much more convincing love interest for Bruce Wayne(Micheal Keaton,once again).She meets him as Salina,but he immedeately notices her dark side.Thier conversation at his manor is pure gold.When the talk turns to former girlfriends,he mentions Vicky Vale.Selina:"Vicky? Ice-Skater or stewardess?"Perfect.As far as the Penquin,well he's one of the most delightfully odeous creations in the history of cinema,with pale,clammy skin,rotten teeth,malformed body,and Danny DeVito ripping into the character with abrasive vigor.He adopts a plan to win over the Gotham citizens,to gain thier trust,so he can get revenge for what his parents did to him.I won't give it away,but's brilliantly dark and twisted."Batman Returns" is an awesome accomplishment,and everything the first one could have been.I recommend the first one anyway,if only to let it's flaws make you appreciate much more the perfection of this one.
