Saturated as we are with images of violence and blood and horror, it may be hard for contemporary viewers to appreciate this extremely stylish, creepy little thriller. The story involves the standard horror tropes - young females in peril, mad doctor, gothic house in the country that hides untold terrors within - yet it transcends them through the serene beauty of its mise-en-scene, the austere black and white cinematography, the minimal use of music, the acting of it's principals, and most of all the presence of Edith Scob, the young woman without a face, wandering her father's mansion in a life-like yet deathly mask that reveals only her enormous haunted eyes. She is an odd prefiguring of Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby - frail, vulnerable, a victim of forces beyond her comprehension, a victim of her father's seemingly mad yet emotionally understandable desire to replace her disfigured face with a healthy face grafted from another young girl captured by his odd accomplice.

Which brings up the relevant topic of face-grafting, so recently in the news. What does it mean to have a face? Or to not have a face? Is not the face the personage we present to the world? Without a face, who are we?

I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a thoughtful thriller. If you want a splatter film, a horror film, a fun thriller, you are definitely looking in the wrong place.
