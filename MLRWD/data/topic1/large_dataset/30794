The plot of this movie was not at all what I thought it would be.  I was not disappointed, though.  I thought it would be a typical boy meets girl (or woman) romance and the struggles they face because of their age difference.  It ended up being a boy meets woman.  Woman wants a sex buddy.  Boy wants to learn to be a sex buddy.  After some empty sex, they start to get to know each other.  Boy falls in love.  Woman keeps him at a distance.  Woman's illiteracy and low class cause her so much shame she lets it steer her in a destructive and isolating direction.  Boy becomes a man and ends up accidentally witnessing her destruction.  Boy-man uses woman's destruction to learn not to self-destruct himself.

Even more unexpected is the nudity!  I didn't think someone of Kate Winslet's caliber would ever do nudity and I've never seen a man's weiner in an R-rated film--but there it was!  I thought the sex scenes were very honest and real, though.  Just kind of suprised me is all.

Overall, VERY good, unpredictable movie!
