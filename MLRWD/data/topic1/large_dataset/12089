I think Alvin and the Chipmunks was an excellent movie. It has a lot to offer if you watch it properly and not just laugh and forget the little funnies. I think kids will learn a lot from it. I as an adult have learnt a lot from it. The Chipmunks, especially Theodore is the youngest and the cutest one. He is expresses his emotions very freely like any kid should. He is loving and very innocent. He is cared for and looked after by his brothers which kids will find very adorable. I think it teaches a little thing or two about being siblings and looking out for each other.
While the three are different, they show us that they are all alright as they are.
The scene where they give Dave Christmas presents was extremely touching. It shows that it is not the size or the price of the xmas gifts that matter, it is the thought put into it- Theodore shows Dave a little picture and makes a xmas card for him while Simon makes for him a paperclip compass.
I think Jason lee was really excellent in the role as well.
 I have ordered my copy of the movie and would recommend it to everyone!! Not everyone however will see it as I did.
