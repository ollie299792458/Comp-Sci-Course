In general, I don't believe in buying DVDs. If I want to see a show, I'll hop down to my local library or Blockbuster and get it there. After all, few discs are so good I want to see them twice.

Not only did I rent Season One twice, I rented it twice back-to-back (the first time for me, the second time to show it to my brother). I watched it both times, fell in love with it, and Season One became my first official DVD purchase. Huzzah!

I love the incredibly clever humor of this show. It doesn't resort to slapstick a la Three Stooges (though I love that too), it doesn't resort to sarcastic one-liners a la Friends (though I love those too). Instead, it puts the "situational" back into "situational comedy" and takes us for a wild ride.

A dysfunctional family is no doubt stressful for anyone who's a member of it, but this show strikes comedy gold in a simple truth: everyone else loves to laugh at your dysfunction. There's an undercurrent of love and loyalty between the Bluths, mainly due to Michael's efforts. But there's a strong friction as well, and the way the family members interact brings that to light.

I don't want to get into plot points and risk spoiling the surprise for those of you who haven't seen it. Suffice to say that this is the only sitcom that has managed to make me laugh so hard, I cried.

Give it a shot. You're missing out if you don't.
