OK, I only skimmed the first 30 or so reviews, but from what I saw, no one touched on the aspect of this film that affected me so.  That was it's treatment and exploration of severe mental illness.
D'Onfrio's character has a highly severe form of schizoprhenia that causes him to do horrible things, which sets up the premise for the film.  The scenes that took place inside his mind were fascinating and heartbreaking.  We saw the three people that he actually was - the little boy he had been before his illness took hold, the man who lurked deep beneath the illness, and the illness itself, which was presented as the screeching demon that it is.  The viewer is invited to explore further into the psyche of a so-called madman than in any other film I've ever seen.  His death in the climax is heartwrenching, for to kill the screeching demon, one must also kill the sad little boy that hides deep inside him.  This was a visually stunning, painful film for me to watch.
Technically, I found the scenes outside D'Onofrio's character's mind typical and humdrum.  I would have preferred more time being spent in artistic and psychological experimentation.  Lopez's social worker is a little too Pollyanna for me, but Vaughn was solid and very FBIish. 
In short, this movie is underrated.  It is also liked and detested for all the wrong reasons.
