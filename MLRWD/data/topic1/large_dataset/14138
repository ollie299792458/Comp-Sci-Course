It's great to finally have the beloved Brothers Marx on DVD. It's just a shame that the first collection contains such a mixed bag. When they get around to releasing their classic Paramount films ("Cocoanuts", "Animal Crackers", "Monkey Business", "Horse Feathers", "Duck Soup") it will make the DVD being reviewed a bit more palatable.
In the current DVD, "A Night at the Opera" is clearly the winner. It is widely hailed as their best film, although cult Marxists tend to declare "Duck Soup" the best (as do I). "A Day at the Races", er, marks the beginning of their sad decline, though it has many funny scenes and memorable lines (Groucho: "Send a dozen roses to Mrs. Upjohn and write 'I Love You' on the back of the bill"). "Room Service" is a filmed play that happens to have Groucho, Harpo and Chico in it (and a few laughs), but like "At the Circus", "Go West" and "The Big Store", should not be viewed by anyone wanting to know what these guys were all about.
"A Night in Casablanca" is in fact worth watching because it's the last bona fide Marx Brothers movie (the abysmal "Love Happy" in 1949 technically is one but core fans disregard it) and is not all that bad. It certainly is the best one since "Races".
Bottom line: ignore the promotional text touting some of these films as being funny Marx Brothers movies. A Marx Brothers movie has a special kind of "funny" that leaves comedic, er, marks on your brain for life. Not all of the movies on this DVD can make that claim.
Mind you, "Circus" has Groucho's classic "Lydia" song and "Go West" has one of my favorite Groucho lines (i.e., "time wounds all heels"). However, rather than straining and waiting for a good line or scene, just wait for "Horsefeathers" or "Duck Soup" on DVD. You won't be disappointed. Swordfish!
