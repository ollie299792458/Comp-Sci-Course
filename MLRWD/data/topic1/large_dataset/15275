When I first watched "The Six Wives of Henry VIII" on CBS during the summer of 1971, I had no idea this mini-series would transform me over the course of six weeks into the Tudor fan I am today.  I had never before seen costumes like the ones in "Six Wives", so authentically reproduced that the actors wearing them look as if they had stepped right out of the paintings of Hans Holbein. There's no more perfect Henry VIII than Keith Michell, who flawlessly portrays the monarch from a slender, idealistic 18-year-old youth to a grossly fat, paranoid, and diseased old man of 55.  The actresses who portray his six wives - Annette Crosbie, Dorothy Tutin, Anne Stallybrass, Elvi Hale, Angela Pleasence, and Rosalie Crutchley - give dazzling, deeply nuanced performances as six queens of differing appearances, ages, backgrounds and personalities, with Henry VIII as the link that connects them all together. I was overjoyed when PBS aired "The Six Wives of Henry VIII" in late 1971, and even happier when it was followed in early 1972 by a second Tudor-themed mini-series: "Elizabeth R".
