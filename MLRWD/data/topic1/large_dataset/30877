I never watch romantic comedies,but decided to watch this because of Sanaa Lathan.First of all,I can't believe that some reviewers have said that she isn' that pretty!How can anyone,black or white,say that she isn't a beautiful woman?Anyway,the movie was o.k.It wasn't anything new.Nothing is at this point.The title "Something New" is referring to Sanaa's character dating a white guy for the first time.One weird thing about the film is that you never get to see her hang out with the white guy's family or friends;you only see him awkwardly trying to fit in with her black friends and family.It was one-sided in that respect.I think that it was somewhat unique in that it was about a black woman dating a white man,when usually it is the opposite.Like I've said,I havent seen any romantic comedies though.I think that the point of the movie was to step outside of your box and let yourself be open to new experiences,as difficult as they may be.Overall,it was alright,although I wil probably never watch another romantic comedy again because it's not my thing.
