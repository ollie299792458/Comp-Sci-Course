"The Last Waltz" was one of the very first films I ever purchased new on VHS, and I have enjoyed it consistently for the last 12 years.  This movie captures one of the most symbiotic relationships between music and film I have ever seen.  Martin Scorsese only had one chance to get this movie right, and he did a great job.
Watch the closeup footage of Levon Helm engulfed in a cool blue light while belting out an amazing version of "Ophelia".  Watch Joni Mitchell filmed in a silouhette backstage as she secretly sings backup to Neil Young's "Helpless".  Watch Dr. John's hands float effortlessly over the piano keyboard while performing a rousing version of "Such A Night".  Watch Rick Danko as he curiously peers over at Bob Dylan, completely unsure of what song they are about to launch into next.  Filled with countless moments like these, "The Last Waltz" is pure enjoyment to the very end.
Since falling in love with this movie, I have learned that drummer Levon Helm was a very uncooperative participant in the production of the movie.  He was not ready for The Band to quit, he believed that Robbie Robertson wanted to make this movie only to further his "rock star" persona, he did not like the fact that Neil Diamond was involved in this project only because Robbie Robertson had just produced a record for him, and from Day 1, he did not like Martin Scorsese.
Knowing that, it is interesting to note how removed Levon seems to be during the interviews, and how much Robbie playes the "Rock Star" role, professing exhaustion from the road, and not knowing how he can go on with this lifestyle.
I am not saying that Levon or Robbie is right or wrong, I am just saying that it is interesting to watch this movie knowing how at least one of the members of the group felt about the project.
If you care about music and quality filmaking, "The Last Waltz" should be part of your permanent collection.
