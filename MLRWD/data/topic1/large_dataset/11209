This was one of the many movies I went to see out of sheer boredom- not because I saw the ads and said to myself "Wow!  I have to see that one!"  Surprisingly, it turned out to be one of the funniest (new) films I've seen in a number of years.  I'm not a particular fan of Ben Stiller's movies (though I always like the man himself).  There wasn't much to laugh about in "There's Something About Mary" or "Meet the Parents", but Stiller's portrayal of Derek Zoolander, dim-witted male model, (along with a number of other roles) had me practically rolling on the floor with laughter.  His dialogue and comic timing are perfectly fitted to the character, and his feigned accent is just icing on the cake.
I was especially pleased to see that "Zoolander" didn't delve nearly so deeply into the "gross-out" humor of some other Stiller films, especially when more and more so-called comedies seem to be following that path every year.  To be sure, there were jokes about sex and bodily functions, but they were doled out sparingly and never came close to overshadowing the other, more clever dialogue.
Comedy is a tricky thing to critique.  After all, perhaps more than in any other genre, quality is all a matter of personal taste rather than objective criteria.  I personally found this film hilarious and enjoyable enough to watch again and again.  For me, it was a rare find in the virtually endless sea of un-funny comedies constantly appearing in theaters around America.
