Almost all of the negative reviews revolve around a comparison to the original. I personally have some issues with the original's stop-motion animation. Filmmakers don't use that technique anymore because it isn't realistic. Yes it's a classic...but let's view this new version with an open mind.

The effects in this version are outstanding. I really enjoyed the gods up in the clouds bickering and messing around with the lives of mortals. Exactly how they are portrayed in mythology.

I only happened across this movie when it was on SciFi channel, after Kull the Conqueror. If you really want to see the worst movie of the 20th century...check out Kull. Not even watchable. But when Jason and the Argonauts came on, I was immediately taken by the depth of the acting. I think the choice of Jason London was done on purpose...he obviously is portraying an "innocent", not established in any way as a man, and at the whim of the gods.

And I happen to believe that Baron Munchausen is one of the most glorious scifi/fantasy movies ever made (along with Dune), so I consider any comparisons a compliment to the new Argonauts.

(Side note...this is apparently a fullscreen DVD. I do not know why they continue to make these. I am looking into the widescreen version, which is apparently only available in Region 2 PAL format.)
