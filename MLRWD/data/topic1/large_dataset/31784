I owned the video for several years and then I purchased the DVD.  This movie is on my top ten favorite movies.

I was surprised when I first purchased the video that the story was by the great Isak Dinsen who wrote Out of Africa.  I won't elaborate on the other reviewers who succinctly posted their thoughts, but I agree with most of them that this is one of the most beautiful movies ever made.

From the first moments of the film where we are introduced to the sisters and their minister father who live in a desolate town on the coast of Denmark and then to the "feast" itself, I was totally entranced.  The scenery was bleak but beautiful, as was the total dedication of this family to the people in this small community.

The part of Babette was played by the glorious French actress Stephane Audran.  You may have seen in her in many French movies, one in particular, Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, and as the mistress of Lawrence Olivier in Bridehead Revisited.  Could anyone be so wonderfully French!  And so beautiful!

The scenes in the small kitchen where Babette cooks her "feast" are undeniably the highlight of the film. I felt like I was there in the kitchen with them with the scents and the heat from the oven. The poor turtle (did they really cook it?), the squabs, the delicious wines.  The looks on the faces of the religious communants when they sampled all of the wonderful dishes along with the wonderful wines.

And the ending, which I won't give away here.  But it was very heartwarming and funny!  Needless to say, this is a movie that should be in everyone's collection who love classic movies.  And this is, in my estimation, a real classic.
