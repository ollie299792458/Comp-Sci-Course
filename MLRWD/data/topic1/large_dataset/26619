It seems Chan just doesn't know what to do anymore.  The more films he makes the worse they seem to be, well not seem they
actually are.  The Medallion, the new Chan action flick is rather
appalling and just plain dumb.  The movie has a nonsencial plot and is poorly conceived.  It's incoherent and a waste of your time and ultimately worse was a waste of mine.  Now in contrast to "The Tuxedo," well maybe they were equally horrible.  It's hard to say.  Here's the best I can offer you of a plot:
  Jackie Chan plays (now this is shocking) a cop from Hong Kong.  He works with a complete doofus Waston played by funny Lee Evans and another secret agent Nicole Jones (gorgeous Claire Forlani).  They are on a mission to rescue a boy being kidnapped who owns a medallion which allows its owner to have amazing powers and of immortality.
  The action sequences are done in ultra-fast motion as if being fast-fowarded so not the best, but a few of the sequences are rather good.  Jackie Chan does have his occasional comic scenes along with Evans but the film is really not worth it.  Stick with a good Chan film such as Rush Hour 1 or 2, hell even Shanghai Knights, which was decent.  The Medallion is rated PG-13
for Action Violence and Some Double Entendre.  In one word, BAD!
See if you must, or if it's even still playing.
