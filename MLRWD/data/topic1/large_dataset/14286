This is my first time reviewing film  so please bear with me.

First 30 minutes was invested in character and story building. Some might find it slow but I  thought it was not only very enjoyable (due to great acting by all the cast), but crucial in setting up for an explosive and complete mayhem.
Also, it doesn't treat the audience like baby like how Hollywood Blockbusters by cast voicing out everything they are doing...

When the action came, it's fast, unflinching and unapologetic..not unlike Bourne but harder and bloodier.
It will give you the best knife battle ever EVER....Simply amazing...
It's brutally real thanks to lack of martial art "string ballet" or cheap Hollywood CG.
It certainly cleared my palette from watching wretched "I Am Number Four."

I used to laugh whenever PR mentions "edge of the seat"  Well I'm not laughing now..
If you're impatient like my wife ,PLEASE just invest 30 minutes watching.  The rest of hour and half will payoff in ten folds.
5 stars for 2 hours of adrenal induced and gut wrenching "edge of seat" roller coaster ride.
