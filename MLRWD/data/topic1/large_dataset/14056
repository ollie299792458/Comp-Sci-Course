This movie is one of my favorites of all time. Mind you, it's no Citizen Kane, but if you're looking for great slapstick, this movie is it. David Spade plays a brilliant straight man off of Chris Farley's well meaning, but bumbling goof. Farley and Spade appear to have been born to play these parts, as they seamlessly melt into their characters.
Anyone who has seen Saturday Night Live when Chris Farley was on knows the excitable, not-too bright characters that he plays.  This time, he is able to bring more depth to this guy as Tommy Callahan, the son of an autoparts company president who walks through life without a care. Although Richard (David Spade) gets all the good lines, Tommy gets all the laughs.
While Farley and Spade went on to take another swing at the "Buddy Picture" genre (Black Sheep), this one is clearly the best of them all.  The comedic timing of both of these seasoned actors, perfected on the SNL stage, makes for a seamless dialogue and you are sure these two have known each other their whole lives. 
An acting nod should also go to another central character, Richard's car, which of course, takes a tremendous beating by Tommy, as well as an angry deer. The interaction between Spade and Farley is perfectly timed, and the writing is pure genius. Appearances by Brian Dennehey, Bo Derek, and Rob Lowe are all well acted, and add to the hilarity. Overall, a great movie.
