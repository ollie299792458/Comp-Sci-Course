I received my Blu-ray copy of "The Man Who Would Be King" during the week & have just finished watching it.My first disappointment was on discovering that it had a Mono only soundtrack.This is not good enough on Blu-ray.The picture quality while being superior to my DVD copy,was not what I had been expecting on Blu-ray.The next disappointment was on discovering that at least two scenes that I can remember from seeing it at the movies in its original release
had been cut.One was the vision of Sean Connery's character falling into the abyss.On the blu-ray,he falls of the bridge & then you see Michael Caine's character talking to Rudyard Kipling.I also remember the tribesmen playing polo with Sean Connery's head as the ball,in the original theatrical release.That scene was also missing from the Blu-ray.I would have thought that if a studio is going to the trouble of releasing a movie on Blu-ray,it does a proper job with the audio and also restores the missing scenes.In other words,be fair dinkum about it,or don't bother.
