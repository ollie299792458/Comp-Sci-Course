If you're like me, buying a box set is risky. Will you like the episodes? Is the price reasonable? Collecting can be expensive!

However, regardless of price, this collection is a MUST! Most other reviews give you a very good description about a series without a plot. And boy, does it work!

What sets this collection away from others is the fact it doesn't use sexual innuendo, scantily clad females, or a barrage of action to keep fans entertained. It simply uses well written comedy with expressions that will keep you laughing throughout the series.

My favorite character ended up being "Osaka", a transfer student who has a whimsical outlook on life with her odd statements such as "One night, I was alone but smelled some else's fart." The butcher knife scene at the vacation house still makes me smile ("I just had a frying pan. Where'd it go?")

These little gems definitely make the show and, quite frankly, if you don't take a chance in buying this collection, at least rent it. You'll enjoy it until the end, which makes you sad it's over.
