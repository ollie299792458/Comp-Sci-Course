This is a remarkable film.

After Josey Aimes (Charlize Theron) decides to take her kids and leave her abusive husband behind, she comes to stay with her parent's for a while in Minnesota. While working as a beautician, she meets up with an old friend, Glory (Frances McDormand) who lets her know about a well-paying job opportunity in the Pearson Taconite Mine. But there is a catch, Glory warns: "you gotta get your gator skin on in order to make it." From the get-go, the boss gives the new female recruits a very unwelcoming time and their male co-workers have a strong belief that women shouldn't be there. From offensive and lewd graffiti to the sexual harassment, the women take all they can get and keep quiet for one reason: if they talk, it'll only get worse. But one did... and it led to the first class action sexual harassment lawsuit in history.

I do believe that, while the plotline if amazing, the actors portrayals of each their roles was flawlessly magnificent. The characters are written in the most believable fashion, and the actors perfectly believable performances. This is a character-driven film... and as such, it delevers a powerhouse blow to the mind.

This is a very emotionally charged film. (Think "Million Dollar Baby.") The way the men abuse of the women and how, even Josey's father, doesn't defend her. The direction is especially well-done: leaving, at times, the events that ocurred to your emagination, but showing you the result (for example, you see Josey arguing with her husband, next scene she's on the floor, bleeding... You don't know what he did, but you know that he did something.)

This is a wonderful fil, well acted, well directed and well written. This is most definately one of those movies that you don't want to miss.
