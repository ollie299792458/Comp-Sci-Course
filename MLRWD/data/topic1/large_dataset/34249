My friends and I have been quoting lines from this movie for years. This is a true classic for any stoner. Best part of the movie is when Thurgood is smoking with Sir Smokealot and he says "I live for this s*it!!!, Get Away From Me Biatch!!!!" And of course who can forget "I'm gonna take your little mexican friend here and I'm gonna Kill him" "Yo, I'm cuban b" "Ah yes, cuban b". One of my favorite movies of all time. To those who say this movie sucks and think it gives stoners a bad name, STONERS ALREADY HAVE A BAD NAME YOU IDIOTS!!!! And yes I'm talking to you sunsparklesunshine. Who the hell listens to Aqua???? Anyways, this movie never stops  getting funny, I've watched it a million times and will watch it a million more. Plus it has my favorite comedian, Dave Chappelle. Every time I get a 20 dollar bill I think of this movie. Better than How High and all the Fridays but those are still good. Not enough can be said about this movie in 1,000 words. 3rd best comedy just under Blazing Saddles and the Monty Python movies. Great movie.
