Growing up in the 50's & 60's, the M&M Boys were captivating for their play & charisma. We played baseball on the sandlot & fantasized that we were one of the Yankees as we hit, fielded & argued. Roger Maris was my idol. In the years long since, having pursued a career & raised a family, I was recently shocked to hear he is not in the HOF!!! This movie is so well done by Billy Crystal! Barry Pepper turns in an outstanding performance and the filming is spectacular. The storyline depicts the rabid press..bombastic in their assaults polarizing fans to all but destroy a humble, modest man, who once loved the game of baseball. They wrote flagrantly untrue stories & the Yankees failed to protect him. His tombstone reads: 61 in '61 Against all odds, and indeed it was! The movie tells it like it was...a womanizing, alcoholic Mantle contrasted to a devoted team player & family man - Maris. He cared so much for Mantle & rescued him by asking him to live w/ he & Bob Cerv...thus beginning the fabulous drive in '61...the mesmerizing pursuit of the HR record by both Mantle & Maris. Roger Maris was a 4x All Star, 2x MVP, HR record holder & should have won the MVP in '62, outplaying Mantle, but lost in a believed contrived ballot. Maris fought many injuries & was expected to play w/ a fractured hand & excruciating pain in '64 when Yankee Mgr Houk, refused to divulge the fracture to Maris until the end of the season after he had his own x-ray taken, revealing the fractured hand. He played on multiple pennant & WS teams, ultimately retiring w/ the Cardinals. His bat & ball are in the HOF & it is long overdue that the King receive his crown! See this movie. It is beautiful! I've watched it again & again. The extras are great as well!
