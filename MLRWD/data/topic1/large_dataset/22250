By watching this movie right away you will think Tim Burton is a genious. I love the anamation and the darkness to it. Even the singing is incridable!

The film starts off in the land of Halloween with Jack, The Pumpkin King. After many years of of celebrating Halloween Jack becomes bored, sad, and depressed. While everyone is celebrating another great halloween, Jack takes a walk into the Forest and finds a mysterious place he has never been before.  A circle of trees each with a door and on those doors a picture representing a holliday.  He looked at each one and then stopped when he saw a Christmas tree painted on one of the doors. He opens it and finds himself in Christmas town. He was looking at everything with wonder, the snow, the elves, presents, and even Santa Clause. Later he comes back to Halloween Town to tell everyone about what he saw. But it was hard to describe.  After many expirements with Christmas he decides he wants to kidnapp Santa clause and become Santa himself. He changes his image and brings Christmas to Halloween.

This is a great film. And I nice way to put a Chrismasy twist on Halloween. I highly recommend it.
