I loved this film! I took it over to my folk's and my dad loved it too. It is silly good fun. However, most of the best jokes assume you already know a lot of trivia about Nixon's Watergate scandal. If you need to be brought up to speed on the events that led to Nixon's resignation, the movie  "All The President's Men" can help. The taped door, the erased  tape, the CREEP list... it's all there. 
There's another aspect of the  film that I didn't become aware of until the second viewing -- the  "coming of age" story of the two 15-year-olds. Even though they  remain ditzy throughout, there is a definite maturation that progresses  through to the end of the movie. Their self-awareness steadily grows. For  example, consider the final shot of them in the credits ("Dancing  Queen")...
I wanted to give it five stars  to counter all the reviews from people who didn't make the connections  between the real events and how they were portrayed in this movie, but  honestly, the movie is only a "4". A good, rollicking, clever  "4". Highly recommended.
