I can understand being disappointed by Revolutions, if you didn't pick up on the deliberate choice of words and names from the first and second movies: Morpheus, the name of his ship, Neo, Anderson, Trinity, Daniels House of Dream Interpretation, etc. If these all make sense to you, then you already know how this movie will end, and the biggest disappointment will be the fact that "Death" (aka Smith, played by Hugo Weaving) and Neo's big fight is just boring to watch. Then again, I guess it's better than 40 days in the desert. They're all set up for the next movie to be called "Matrix Revelation." I enjoyed the movie because of the parallels, and because I could see where they were going.
On the other hand, if you didn't get any of the above, which it appears to me most reviewers don't, then you might as well take the blue pill, or better yet, go read a good book. This movie is chock full of inside references, both to mythology and to established religions. If you don't get any of those references, you'll be one of the bitter and disappointed viewers who don't understand why the ending turned out the way it is.
