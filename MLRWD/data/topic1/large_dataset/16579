I find this movie exhilirating. I haven't read the book, but I understand that some major changes in plot, theme and tone have been made by the director of Orlando. So if you want the movie to be just like the book,  just give up. It ain't gonna happen.
But if you are willing to take the  movie on its own terms - directed by Sally Potter, not by Virginia Woolf -  then you might enjoy this film.
Let me note some of the major attractions  of Orlando:
1. It is a beautiful film to look at. Orlando is about a  person who lives over four hundred years - from the reign of Elizabeth I to  1990. Each period gets full and proper attention. the 19th century is dark  and foggy, the 20th sharp and bright and 17th rich and royal reds. The  visuals enhance the theme rather than drown the characters.
2. Tild  Swinton. A lot of people criticized her acting as being dull or  understated. I tended to think she hit things on the mark. In order to get  the feeling that the movie is about Orlando - and not about scenery - she  wisely chooses to be detached. I got the feeling that Orlando was observing  things, which heightens the feeling of not quite fitting in, even as  Orlando tries to grapple with the world he/she inhabits. This is important  to capture if the character lives through different time periods.
3. Lot  of neat details and in-jokes. Potter does not try to say too much about the  nature of gender or other heavy duty topics. She let's the viewer think for  himself. This means that there is lots of room for clever in jokes.  Example: the same actor plays an impoverished poet in 1700 and a greedy  publisher in 1990. 
Taken together, you get a great movie. One person  compared it to 2001: A Space Oddysey. I think it is a good comparison. Lush  visuals, loose plot that still sticks to some simple good ideas, leisurely  understated acting, etc. Overall, just great. It all comes together in what  I think is a unique movie.
