When Arnold Schwarzeneger made this movie he proved to the audience that he was a clever script chooser. He can make not only action movies, but flics with smart storytelling. We can`t forget the fact that Paul Verhoeven was behind the camera, directing the movie. His histerical view and pace make the story even better. And the best part is the fact that there is room for some tricks. When Arnie`s character goes to rekall, he sets up what he wishes to be his memories. And as you watch his choices, you see that he is setting the whole story of the movie. He chooses to save the whole planet (Mars), he chooses to be a secret agent, he chooses to have a brunette girlfriend. That is all he gets. You could say, of course, that he is only reflecting the memories that he has deep inside his mind. But the moment you say that you are just proving how clever this plot is: even when the movie ends,  you will never know if all these things that happened were really set in the real world or only as a dream. But who cares? What's the difference?
