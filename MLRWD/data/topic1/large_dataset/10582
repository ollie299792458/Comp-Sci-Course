Michael Mann's "Heat" not only has everything a great crime drama should in terms of plot and action, but also all the elements of a masterpiece of filmmaking. The dialogue is terse and no-nonsense; the stellar ensemble cast provides flawless performances; and the plot is thoughtfully nuanced, striking a perfect balance between action and meaningful character development. Scenes portraying the professional/criminal lives of the characters are blended seamlessly into scenes that give us in-depth looks into their personal lives. As a character study, the script draws fascinating contrasts and parallels between Pacino's and De Niro's characters. Refreshingly, the supporting cast serves an actual purpose in terms of plot development and influencing the actions of the main characters. It is this insight into the personal lives and relationships of the characters as much as any other aspect of the film that will hold your interest.
As far as the plot is concerned, it will keep you riveted provided that you have an adult attention span. The film runs nearly 3 hours, but not a minute is wasted.
