Cushing is fantastic and my only complaint is that more episodes are not availible.  The six that are here look a bit dated, as they have that old TV "look" to them but this was the 60's after all and the BBC was one step above PBS level at this point in time from what I've heard so have a care and get over it.  Once your jaded, 2010, everything 3D and CGI minds adjust it is fine.  The transfer itself is very clear and clean cut.

The stories and acting are what matter here and each episode holds your interest and just to see Peter Cushing play as Holmes is worth the price of admission.  He takes command and demands your attention in every scene.  Nigel Stock is a capable Watson and along with the Wimer series recently released, provides a nice bridge between seasons from '64/65 to '68.  From a Sherlock Holmes fan POV, this is a must own and a part of Sherlockian history.  Combined with Cushing's '59 Hammer version of Hound and TV's Masks of Death, he deserves to be mentioned along with Brett and Rathbone as the best to ever play the role.
