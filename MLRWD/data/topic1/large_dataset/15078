Of all the different productions of Swan Lake that I have seen thus far, Steffi Scherzer is the best Principal dancer I have had the pure pleasure of watching. She is at one with her performance. The thing that I noticed most about her is delicate movement of her arms, which are so expressive and feminine. Actually, I really cannot convey as much as I would like about the beauty of her performance. Also, Oliver Mats'performance is wonderful. His turns and leaps are done quite excellently. My last praise goes to the ballet troupe in general, with special attention for the swans at the lake. They are ALL in step with one another from every angle. And speaking of angle, the camera work is excellent. It allows the viewer to see what the dancers are actually accomplishing. My only critism is that I didn't like the Queen Mother's elongated performance. This should not have been so. It was too long. And she should not have been the one to close the show. Bravo to Steffi Scherzer and to Oliver Matz.
