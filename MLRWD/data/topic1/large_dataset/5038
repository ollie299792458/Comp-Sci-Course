This is the new 2004 Dawn Of The Daed (1978) Divix Special Edition Theactical Version. This is a cleaned DVD, polished so you can see every blue zombie, and every gut splitting second. This DVD has many special "SPECIAL" features like hidden easter egg interviews of Chris Romero (wife) and Tom Sivina (FX). If you are a collector and dont have this virson, buy it! IT SHINNY! But if you never seen the original Dawn of the Dead...DONT! Do not buy this DVD unless you want to be left out, it may be cleaned, it may have extras, but its bad! Why?....because its cut! Cut?!?! what do you mean? On the back it says is longer, yah but not in the wat you think! This dvd does not feature the docking bay scene with Josef Pilato as the police officer and also cuts cool scenes that are funny and bloody. THIS IS A THEATER VERSION!!!!! meaning some guts are not included. They cut cool scene and extanded room scenes (a.k.a. "PANIC" scenes). These are the begining scenes in which every one panics! They extend the camera scenes and show more, like the computers and peoples reactions. Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger make this move great! But I still must say, only buy this if! IF your collecting this kind of stuff or this is your only chance to see it. But there are 2 main reasons I still must say do not buy, if you never saw this Dawn of the Dead...
1.) ITS EDITED!!!!(a.k.a. cut)
2.) There will be a special edition 3 disk DVD box set for Dawn of the Dead, featuring DAWN (78), DAWN (04), and zombi. And later on there will be a DEAD BOX SET, that will have Night(68),Night(98),Dawn(78),Dawn(04),Zombi,Zombi 2,Day(85),zombi3,zombi4,zombi5, and more!!!
NOW, its up to you to decide to buy it or not...or you could wait untill September/October.
