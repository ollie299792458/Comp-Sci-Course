"Swimfan" is a movie that takes you out of your comfort zone.  There are moments that make your heart beat faster and moments that make you squirm.  Dark, sexy, and eerily realistic, "Swimfan" will make you rethink all of the relationships you ever had-or didn't have.  If you're ready to plunge into the dangerous, yet overlooked world of obsessive love, then this is the movie you've been waiting for.  Kiss those other raunchy  teen flicks goodbye!

Contentment drips off of Ben Cronin, a high school swimmer with a sweet girlfriend and a shot at Stanford.  But his happiness is soon tested by Madison Bell, a beautiful new student who is quick to lead Ben astray.  After a one-night stand in the school pool, Madison assumes the two are an item, and starts moving in for the kill.  Ben, however, realizes his mistake, and attempts to distance himself from her.  What he doesn't know is that the farther he tries to get from Madison, the closer she comes.  She befriends his real girlfriend, makes out with his teammate, steals his car, and eventually, screws him over in a way that may be fatal.

Love it or loathe it, "Swimfan" has an intriguing storyline that, unfortunately, some of us may be able to relate to.  It shatters the belief that stalking is glamorous and idyllic.  In addition, it demonstrates that both women and men may be victimized by this crime.

"Swimfan" may not be the kind of movie you would like to watch every weekend, but it does merit some consideration.  The main actors-Jesse Bradford, Erika Christensen, and Shiri Appleby-may not be the most notable Hollywood figures, either, but they (especially Christensen, who plays Madison) give solid performances.  This is a movie that all teenagers should see, just to raise their awareness about the important issue of stalking.

**Pay attention to the lighting-a lot of thematic symbolism there.
