Sure, Eli Roth has nothing to do with this film, and that had me very skeptical from the time I heard another sequel was being made, and Roth had absolutely no involvement in it at all.
It seemed like "Hostel 3" was just going to be another sequel made for money. One that was only made to cash in on the success of it's predecessors, had nothing to do with the "Hostel" world us fans grew to love, and would just have the famous name slapped onto it to help sell the movie.
With all that said, and now have actually seen the film, I can say it's none of that. The film is different from Eli Roth's "Hostel", and "Hostel 2", but that's to be expected when someone else takes over on a project.
The game has changed in this film. Instead of taking place in Slovakia, it takes place right here in America. Vegas to be exact. As you know: What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas....
As apposed to people all over bidding on people to kill, like a twisted/psychotic version of eBay, Hostel 3 is a gambling game. People betting on how, and when the victims will meet their demise.
This film isn't as dark as the previous installments, but it's not the crappy film I thought it was going to be.
This is definitely a film I support!

I give it 8 and a half out of 10 stars.
