This is a great documentary summarizing the life of one of the most infamous serial killers in cinema history, Mr. Fred Krueger.  From the first Nightmare film to Freddy vs. Jason, "Never Sleep Again" covers every crack, corner and crevice of Freddy's legacy.  Every film is broken down and dissected with interviews from various actors, actresses, writers, producers and even New Line Cinema executives.  It even goes in depth with the "Freddy's Nightmares" TV show, which before watching this, I barely knew anything about.  I love how most of Freddy's famous kills are broken down and explained in detail about how they were filmed, great stuff.  Just seeing the impact and celebrity icon that Freddy became is just unbelieveable.  I learned so much from this film and it's definitely worth the hefty price.  I highly recommend this to every "Nightmare on Elm Street" fan or horror film fan in general.  Without hesitation, "Never Sleeps Again" definitely blows "His Name was Jason" and "Halloween: 25 Years of Terror" straight out of the water.
