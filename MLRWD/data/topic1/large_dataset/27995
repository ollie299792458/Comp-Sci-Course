My Bloody Valentine was an attempt by Paramount to cash in on the success of films like Halloween and Friday the 13th, which truly set the precedent for the slasher film genre as we know it today.  The writers of the flick weren't trying to be original by any means, in fact, the only thing they had to come up with was a holiday that hadn't been used yet in a horror film, hence Valentine's Day.  What sets MBV apart?  Well, for one, the actors are all Canadian, proven by their accents.  Two, the cast was all blue collar, working class (no students or teenagers); think the characters in The Deer Hunter minus the whole Vietnam thing.  Other than that this one is a follower.  It even has the crazy "you're all doomed" guy in it!  All that aside, it's a must watch for fans of the genre.  As for the DVD:

Pros:

1.  DVD transfer is nice, picture looks good.
2.  Includes deleted gore which is pretty impressive by early 80s standards,
3.  Has some interviews with crew and some of the cast about the movie.

Cons:

1.  Deleted footage is far from being seamlessly integrated into the film.  The footage is very grainy and is quite obvious when they decide to splice the film.
2.  Cover of the DVD is corny (looks like one of those covers you get with a 5 dollar DVD from CVS Pharmacy or something.)
3.  No director's commentary for the movie.  The only commentary you get is when crew introduces a deleted scene.  Some might like this though.
