Qiu Ju is an excellent film. First off Zhang Yimou is one dynamic director. I was already a fan of "Raise the Red Lantern" and I was looking for another movie. I actually bought this movie sight un seen. I did not see this movie on cable, like most of the ones I have written reviews. I do not regret spending one dollar on this movie. This is not a epic piece it is set in modern day China. 
Qiu Ju's husband is kicked in the groin after having a dispute with the village chief. Qiu Ju and Wan wanted to build a storage shed to store chillies that they grew. They needed permission from the chief,he kept refusing their application. The couple even cleared an area of their allocated land to bulid the shed. The Chief was busting chops.In anger Wan said to the chief he would not have any heirs,he could raise only hens(daughters). Fighting words(huh):). Officer Li was interesting in this,he tried to make peace between the two parties. He even spent his own money to make a peace offering. He knew the village Chief (Wang) was a prideful man. Several attempts to make a monetary apology was not accepted. Qiu Ju reminds me of the determined lad in "Beijing Bicycle" just that stubborn. She went to all levels of the government to get a verbal apology.  Watch for the turn of events through each level of government she encounters,and the opportunities to let it go. The very person she was seeking the government to force him to apologize,is the same person who saved her life. Unfortunatley in the end she could not save his.
