Many months prior to watching the INDY trilogy on DVD, I saw RAIDERS on a widescreen VHS edition. The sound was spectacular, the picture quality was quite good for VHS. When Indy cracks that whip in the opening sequence, it really made you jump. When I saw the RAIDERS DVD, again terrific picture quality but the sound was not quite the same. The rumble, the crumble of the temple in the opening is fine (especially the boulder), but the whip crack is not as good, not as enveloping. This is also true of the fistfight with the German - the punches don't carry the same oomph. Perhaps it is because I do not have a THX-modified DVD player or receiver, though the VHS version had THX sound and proved to be just as effective. The whip cracking is also not as effective in TEMPLE OF DOOM or LAST CRUSADE DVD's.

This is a great set nonetheless. RAIDERS is my favorite action-adventure film, TEMPLE OF DOOM is an example of a cartoonish roller-coaster ride into excess, and LAST CRUSADE is as laid-back as an INDY adventure get. The documentaries were informative. Just that the sound quality is not quite up to par with what I expected (sometimes the music is stronger in audio levels than the action on screen).
