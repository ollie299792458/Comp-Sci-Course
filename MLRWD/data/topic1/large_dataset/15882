"The Gospel of John" is a very accurate, word-for-word account of the life of Jesus from his first meeting John the Baptist until his crucifixion. Although this movie is very accurate, it is also extremely long and at times can be somewhat boring. If one is not familiar with the Book of John or anything related to the life of Jesus when he was developing such a strong following and gathering his disciples, I feel that it is very easy to get confused as the narrator only focuses on the Book of John. The movie follows Jesus through his journey and recreates the moment he meets John the Baptist and gathers his disciples. The movie also portrays Jesus' first miracle of turning water into wine and shows him curing a man's blindness. I had to watch this movie for my world religions class in college and it does tie into the chapter we are studying on Christianity by diving deeper into the life and death of Christ. I know this movie was made several years ago, so I tried to keep that in mind while watching it. I felt at times the actor who portrayed Jesus over-acted and exaggerated the part of Jesus. He almost seemed more of a magician and storyteller than the man who is supposed to be our humble Messiah. I feel also that at times the narration was a bit too much; telling a story when the events taking place on screen should have been the story. I don't think that watching this movie will turn a non-believer into a believer as it is too old-fashioned for today's audience. Overall, I guess the movie was portrayed very accurately, just a bit exaggerated. I feel very strongly it should be redone, (and no, "Passion of the Christ" does not count) to appeal to a younger, more jaded audience.
