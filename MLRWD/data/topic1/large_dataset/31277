It was ironic (or perhaps not) that Woody Allen and Mia Farrow were in the midst of a terrible breakup when this film came out.  I only saw it recently, and it's one of those films that technically would never fly, unless Allen was behind it.

I enjoyed the partial-documentary sequences where the characters discuss their marriages, breakups, etc., and dark comedy that surrounds it all.

Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis are that old married couple you think would stay together forever, but they're breaking up.  Woody finds himself strangely drawn to one of his writing students (Juliette Lewis makes the film!), who seems to get every man she meets on a string without even trying, Mia hooks up with Liam Neeson...there's a certain shallowness protrayed when it comes to people, and that really hit me.

Perhaps as I was going through my own marriage breakup at the time I saw this awhile back, it struck chords with me I didn't think it would.  In any case, this is not a madcap Woody film.  It's a sometimes harsh examination of how people deal with each other, and don't always realize what they've got.

You need to be in the right mood for this one, but it's worth the time.
