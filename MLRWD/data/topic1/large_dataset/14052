We used this book and additional helps (video) in our small groups at church.  And the whole program was one of the most practical studies we have ever had.  Bill Hybels uses Biblical, yet totally common sense methods in helping us understand the thought processes we need to develop to reach the people God brings into our circle of influence.

I believe this book is a great wake-up call for most of us Christians who have gotten ourselves into such comfortable ruts, we miss the obvious opportunities God has given us.  This book is simple to read, easy to understand, and if you have been a Christian struggling with why you haven't shown any "fruit" lately, it will be a breath of fresh air.

I highly recommend this to any believer who desires to fulfill the God-given command to reach the world... and it starts with that person sitting or standing across the room from you, or on the bus beside you, or standing in the grocery line behind you.  It's likely that wherever you are there are people you don't know who are crying out for someone to reach out to them.  This book may help you see it.  It definitely helped me!
