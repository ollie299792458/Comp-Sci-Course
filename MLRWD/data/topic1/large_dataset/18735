Following the advice of a co-worker, I decided to finally rent "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines". I was kind of avoiding it, because Schwarzenegger once said that he would only do T3 if James Cameron were involved.

Well, Cameron must've transmogrified into the giant dump truck of money driven up to Arnold's place.

Where do I start with just how awful this movie was... wooden acting, revisionist continuity almost on par with "Highlander 2: The Quickening", no sense of fear or danger, I mean, I think the T-1000 could slap around the T-X just by staring at her. And too many: "Hey look, this is a reference to the last two movies!" moments.

And the ending, oh geez, I won't spoil the oh-so-huge twist ending but was the most anticlimatic piece of dreck I've ever seen. And frankly, I wouldn't trust my life to somebody who killed my future self not too long ago, thank you.

I thought this movie was iffy when I first heard about it. And this is a true story: when I went to "The Matrix Reloaded" on opening night some executives from Warner Bros. were in the audience and asked us to do a survey afterwards. One of the questions asked our opinion of the T3 trailer shown beforehand. I let them know exactly what I thought given the limited responses available: "It it highly unlikely that I will see this movie." I mean, I just sat down to see a movie where machines have taken over the world and the T3 trailer made Terminator start to look like a Matrix ripoff!

I wonder if you can file class actions against state governors who made bad movies to get our money back.

Well, I finally watched "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" and I can't unwatch it. Now any future viewings of T1 and T2 have been tainted, thank you so very much mister director-man. Thank you for running a once-respected action franchise into the ground. I won't be back.
