Robert Duvall is without exception one of the best actors in this period, in my opinion.  The Apostle is a movie about a man who, as a young boy, experiences highly charged evangelistic preaching, and in turn, becomes an evangelist.  His Mother is his biggest supporter in his ventures.  Even though he truly believes in Jesus and is a Christian, he commits unforgiveable sins, and is fully knowledgeable about what he has done, so he escapes from the place where the crime was committed, and, with very little money, strikes out to begin a new life.  He only gives people his initials, and calls himself the Apostle.  He manages to obtain a small church, and many willing workers to help him renovate it.  He eventually draws a large crowd of followers, mostly African Americans.  You almost hope he can go through life preaching to this simple group, but his past overtakes him and he soon has to pay the price for his crimes.  this is a mesmerizing story, thanks to Duvall, and you will be totally captured by his phenomenal portrayal of the Apostle.
