I love this movie, but I feel I love it more for its potential then what it actually achieves.  This movie manages to actually feel more like a fantasy book then a movie.  It adheres to the rules of modern, adult fantasy stories.  The Fairies / elves are dark and mysterious despite being on the side of light.  The scenery is magical.  Everything seems dreamlike.  The acting is marvelous. I would say Tom Cruise is the weakest actor of the lot, and that probably has more to do with the fact he has done some many things it is hard to suspend his acting history.  The weakness of this movie is the plot.  It is a simplistic good vs evil tale that is drawn out too long.  However, even this does allow the viewer some time to revel in the setting.  I do fear the meandering of the story will deter multiple viewings, but thanks to the magic of DVD you can just jump to the scene that you want.  I also like the fact that both the director's cut and the American release versions are including on the DVD with all the usual commentaries.  This is a dreamlike story, a lulling tale before bedtime, not an action pact adventure.  It is in the tradition of books like The Last Unicorn, or Patricia A. McKillip's stories.
I feel that the only fantasy movie that does a better job of telling it's story more like a modern fantasy (fairy tale subdivision) book than a kid's movie is Lord of the Rings.  And I believe that Lord of the Rings, Legend, and Labrynth (Jim Henson) are the three movies that lovers of the genre should check out.
