Jackie Chan demonstates in this film that not only is he a great martial artist and dare-devil, but also a great director and a good actor.  He wanted to prove that Hong Kong could produce movies as good or better than Hollywood for less money.  I think in some ways he succeeded in that goal.

In an interview on this dvd, Jackie says that the financial constraints made shooting stunts more dangerous, because they couldn't rehearse them as much.

Another interesting fact from the interview is that Jackie's house in this movie was his house in real life.

This dvd is great as many others have attested.  Regarding the dubbing, I doubt it would have been possible to retain the old English dub as this version is longer than the old vhs version.  However, it would've been better if they had gotten an actor who sounded more like Jackie.

Depite a few slapstick scenes, this movie has a very real feel.  The bad guys are not catoonish, and the action is not on a stage or in front of a blue screen.  When you see somebody falling off a roof, it is a real person risking his or her life to make a stunning scene.

I personally agree with others that this may be Jackie's best movie.  However, I must admit that my wife hated it.  She thought the slapstick scenes were just dumb, and she is less impressed with stunts.  So, you can't please everybody.
