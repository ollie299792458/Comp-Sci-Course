I didn't hate it.  I went into it expecting nothing better than an on-screen fanfic with more nudity, or something along the lines of some of Feldman's bad 90's movies, so I was fairly surprised.  It had holes and a generic plot line, and I didn't like the cover of Cry Little Sister, but besides that...

The gore was so over the top it was funny (I laughed anyway), none of the acting was cringe worthy.  Some of the writing was iffy, but it wasn't terrible.  Feldman played Edgar *exactly* as he did in 1986--there's a character with zero growth.  He even had the same hair and red bandanna.  (He cleaned up really well, not his usual scruffy, sleazy self.)  I liked the soundtrack, the sets weren't bad.  The bike tricks were pretty cool.

Yes, it plays homage to the original A LOT.  They even stole a chunk of memorable dialogue.  The sex scene isnt nearly as well shot as in the original.

It's not a good movie, but it's not terrible either.  If you go in hating it, you will.  If you go in with a sense of humor and low expectations, it might surprise you.  It was written as a love letter to the original.  It wasn't trying to be its own movie, and it wasn't trying to be better.  If you're a fan you will love it or hate it, it all depends on your attitude.  If you're not a fan, well, there are many worse vampire movies out there.
