Its the prototypical 80's action flick.  I saw it lots of times in the theatre when I was 10 in 1986.  I love this movie.

This edition is far richer in features than the original DVD release, which had none.  The video, however, is still not cleaned up, its the same grainy stuff in the first release.  The sound is excellent, however.  And the special features are interesting, with all of the cast interviews and the survival training featurette.  All to the good.

The problems start with the commentary track.  Military advisors, writers, and Tony Scott.  Far too crowded.  They should have had separate commentary tracks for the advisors, director, and writers.  Audio tracks don't take up much disc space.  The special edition of Platoon does this perfectly.

But the most annoying part of this edition, is that during the commentary, Tony Scott talks about deleted scenes and the other filmed endings constantly.  Where the heck are they on the DVD?

I think they're going to release another special edition for the 20th anniversary in 2006 when it (allegedly) gets re-released to theatres.  If you have the original Top Gun DVD, don't bother with this one.  It tries, but they held a lot potenailly interesting extras back for a twenty year old movie.
