There are seven artistic moments in my life where i know exactly where and when i was when it happened, in order:  '87 see U2 video for Where the Streets Have No Name; '87 hearing the U2 album The Unforgettable Fire; '91 see Nirvana video for Smells Like Teen Spirit; '92 see Pearl Jam video for Evenflow; '95 seeing the movies Trainspotting and The Usual Suspects; '96 reading Jerzy Kosinski's Blind Date and The Painted Bird; and in '97 reading Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead...
  Trainspotting is a moment in time that can't be caught again...Britian was in vogue (music, fashion, and young actors; much like it is again today in '05-06).  The combination of Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle, Johnny Miller, and Ewen Bremmer is and was unstoppable. The use of noir camera tricks and music and background color and lighting is used to low-budget perfection in this film.  The Scottish language and humor takes at least three times viewing for Americans to pick up.  I don't know if this film romanticizes heroin use or warns of it; but it's a hell of a good film...one anyone could watch over and over and over...and i have, and will keep watching it...what a pace this movie sets...at the end, when the techno music is playing while Renton does his escape move; it's just absolutely perfect, as if you can feel your and Renton's heart beating and picking up speed with the music...absolutely perfect...
