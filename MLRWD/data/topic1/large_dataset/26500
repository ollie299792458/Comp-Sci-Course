Love him or hate him, there is no other director like David Lynch.  True, his films are not for everyone and so reviewing or recommending his work is always a difficult process.  If you've seen, and appreciated, his previous movies then you will surely love "Inland Empire", Lynch's most daring, creative and challenging work to date.  If not, than this film is probably not for you.

As other reviewers have noted, the plot of this movie revolves around an actress (Laura Dern) who's life becomes intertwined with a character she's playing.  Of course, it sounds a little gimicky, but Dern's transition from one reality to another is pulled off with eerie perfection.  Perhaps less narrative than some of his previous films, Lynch develops atmosphere, tone and mood to create a three hour nightmare of loosely connected scenes and images - for example, the frequent shots of giant rabbits in a bizarre, sit-com-like tableaux seem to have little to do with Dern and the rest of the film.  Pulled back and forth between time and place, the audience is left disoriented and looking for answers until the final scene.  Whether you love it or hate it, you will never see another movie like "Inland Empire".
