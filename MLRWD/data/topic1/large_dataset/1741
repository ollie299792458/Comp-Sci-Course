A bit hokey in spots but, as a whole, not a bad film.  Errol Flynn has to prove himself to a group of pilots as he assists Ralph Bellamy in experiments to help pilots overcome high altitude sickness. He earns his wings and becomes totally absorbed in the trials.  One by one, members of the group who opposed him at first are lost. But Errol will help save the day! Great aerial and ground scenes, I believe filmed at at San Diego. The colors are great. As an aircraft afficionado, it is great for me to see Grumman F3F's (from Air Group 6, USS Enterprise), Douglas TBD Devastators which gained a negative claim to fame as very few of them survived the battle of Midway, and early model Vought SB2U Vindicators. The aircraft are brilliantly painted in peacetime colors. Look for the British "fighter"! The studio used a fixed gear Ryan trainer and jazzed it up to make it look like a hot fighter. Why they put a cowling used on an air cooled engine on a water cooled plane is odd. The propellor spinner is at the top of the cowling whereas on an aircooled engine it would be in the center. Oh well, nobody's perfect. It's still a good movie, definetly worth the cost!
