Elizabeth is back and she is... well... 55... You wouldn't tell from the movie, would you? Bearing in mind that average life expectancy was below 30 in her times, she was positively ancient...
Well, you shouldn't be able to tell her age and generally too much knowledge of history will spoil the fun. When the movie started I decided to follow Coleridge's advice to "suspend my disbelief" and enjoyed it OK.
You don't get a lesson in history here (a very general but shouldn't you have known before about the Armada?) you get a picturesque vision of history and as such it works. Some twists made me smile. I found it quite amusing that all Roman Catholics look ugly and their behaviour is rather irrational. A comment to the ending - Elisabeth left England in debts (although not bankrupt as Philip did) and the quoted "age of prosperity" led directly to the Civil War half a century later.
Show it to your children - if it makes them interested in history, it's for the best. If they can remember only the date 1588 after the movie it's a sufficient reason to spend an evening together.
