This set of Fields flicks is long overdue. While it's wonderful to see "Its a Gift" on DVD, we already had the Criterion issue of "The Bank Dick". "Chicadee" and "Honest Man" are always welcome and "International House" has its moments but I cannot fathom why "The Man On The flying Trapeze", "The Old Fashioned Way", "If I Had A Million", "Tillie and Gus", Never Give a Sucker an even Break", "You're Telling Me, "Million Dollar Legs", "Missisippi" and "Poppy" are withheld year after year from DVD. I love Fatty Arbuckle but shouldn't Fields come first? Does Fields not stand shoulder to shoulder with Chaplin? Does the honesty and human frailty of Harold Bissonette (pronounced Bissone') not rival the brilliance of "The Little Tramp" in "The Gold Rush?" Do we not deserve the opportunity to see all the performances of arguably the funniest man who ever lived?

How do we expect to nurture new generations of great writers and directors when the above mentioned "American Splendors" are witheld from view. How sad that the history of Vaudeville, The Cigar Box Routine and all of these other great hours of comedic brilliance must be seen on homemade VHS copies in the year 2005 while video outlets are shrines to the likes of "Sharkey's Machine".

As my dad so aptly said: "It's not the money, IT'S THE MONEY!" Rise up Fields fans! Buy a dozen copies of this box set so the powers that be will be forced to release the rest of these gems. Think Fast Mr. Motos! Sincerely, Carl LaFong! (Captol L , small A etc.)
