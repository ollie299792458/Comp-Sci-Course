I was in the front row at the taping of this Live Concert video in Kettering Ohio.  It is a composite of two concerts shot on consecutive Saturday and Sunday nights.  I agree with most of the other reviewers that mention the schizoid editing.  But, what I know, that they don't, is that it is even worst than they think.  There is not a single song on this video that is edited from just the one night.  I can see myself in the same songs,showing up in the front row, sometimes in front of Sheryl and then a second later dressed differently in front of Peter Stroud. The sound for each song must come from one night or the other, but the video is a mishash.  And to cap it all off, they cut out the best single moment in the entire two nights.  This took place during the song Steve McQueen, when during the lead solo, both Sheryl and Peter went down on one knee next to each other at the very edge of the very low stage, directly in front of my date and me with their guitars meer inches from out faces for about 20 seconds.  At one point I felt Sheryl's hand brushed me while she was stumming.  In the edit these moments were reduced to a 1/2 second blur of Peter turning away after they stood up.  This was the most energetic moment in close to 4 hours of filming,and they left it on the cutting room floor.  Sometimes the videographers think they are the show. This is one of those times. I would definately like to see a recut of this someday.  But having been there, I still bought several copies of this video.  And I have to tell you that the music is great.  I attended over six of the performances on this tour, and Kettering was the pick of the litter.
