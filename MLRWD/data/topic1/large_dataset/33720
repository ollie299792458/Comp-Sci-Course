Here -- in "The Lake House" -- is a summertime movie for all seasons that will persuade some of us (at least including my wife and myself) that there still is hope for Hollywood.

It's more than the Jane Austen analogy (that ties "Persuasion" to the plot of this movie) that helps it succeed, although it just figures that Ms. Austen would enjoy this movie.  Your mind (if it was not dormant upon your arrival in the theater) is wide awake in this movie, and you find yourself thinking ... which likely was not what you had in mind before the show, given the images projected by some (perhaps) well-meaning critics.

This movie is really good -- far beyond the norm for a "good" summertime movie, and well into the genre of movies for all seasons that you would be delighted to see again.  Ann and I already have seen "The Lake House" twice, and while we enjoyed it enough to return (a rare occurrence indeed), we liked it even more the second time around.

Everything about this movie is really good -- the plot, the actors, the pace, the music, the messages, the imagery, the dog, the architecture, the scenery, the fundamental honesty, the hopeful idealism, and the creative imagination -- as well as the perspective in which all of those elements are wrapped for presentation to you as a viewer.

You leave the theater with real appreciation for this movie, all of it, like an unexpectedly wonderful dinner that leaves you wondering whether it might be appropriate not to eat another meal (at least for a few days) just to do this one honor.

That is why this review really is just a way of saying thank you to the folks who made this movie.
