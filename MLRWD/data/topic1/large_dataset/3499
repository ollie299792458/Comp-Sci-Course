I love Robert Pattinson. I think he's the only foreign actor I've watched where I actually prefer his American accent over his English one. I believe he is an incredible actor with great potential. This was a great movie. Emilie De Ravin is great also. I've only ever seen her in Lost, but I really like her. This story has a lot of different layers to it. I didn't really read too much about the film before I saw it so I was shocked at the end. I new something dramatic would happen, but not what I saw. I was moved. I'm trying not to give too much away. I love what a great big brother he played! I myself have a much older big brother and can relate how protective they can be for their baby sisters. He was awesome! I wish there could have been a bit more back story about his brother. I feel that was a bit lacking, but it didn't make or break the film. Overall, I recommend it. I personally wouldn't buy it, mainly because I have a hard time watching a movie more than once that made me cry. That's just me.
