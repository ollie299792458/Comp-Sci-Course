This is a bad movie, straight up boring.  "SLC Poser" would be a more appropriate title, since the real crux of the film (which is explicit in the bumbling script) is protagonist Steve-O's realization that he has no  investment in any of the values he claims to hold so dear.  Neither does  the film, of course, and this movie is the cinematic equivalent of your  parents telling you you'll grow out of it.  If you're anything like the  punks in the movie, you will.  The version of punk shown here is like a  hissy fit being thrown by a spoilt child.
Perhaps worst of all this  film's crimes is the totally inappropriate production value.  MTV-style  quick cutting and super glossy film stock give this movie the atmosphere of  a Saturday morning cartoon, albeit one where "f you" is the tag  line that all the talking action figures say.  Steve-O's obnoxious mugging  and his sidekick Bob's lame "dude"-isms only make this worse.  Even at its most superficial, punk is always gritty and unrefined, these  production techniques are more suited to "hackers"-esque  technopop flicks.
I usually enjoy punxploitation film, but even the  soundtrack here feels tacked-on and jumbled.  Good punk films like  "Suburbia" make the punk elements feel organic, and have at least  a hint of empathy.  I never felt a thing in SLC Punk, even at the hackneyed  tragic ending, because who cares what happens to a bunch of rich frat boys  with mohawks?  Besides, every punk in this movie has perfect skin, so you  know it's just Hollywood exploitation.
