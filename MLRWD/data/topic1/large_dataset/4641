I just watched this movie again for probably the 50th time. I must say I rarely enjoy watching love stories, but this movie is about so much more. Forget all the reviews from those of you that only see the immoral side of this movie because of the extra-marital affair. If the truth be known, the same ones that criticize have probably longed all of their lives for the type of love and passion that this movie unfolds. When I first saw this movie with a friend of mine over 10 years ago, it touched me so deeply i wanted to go back and watch it alone, which I did. Since then I get so emotional, I regret ever turning it on. This movie is one of the most beautiful love stories ever written. It is deep on a level that most people can surely relate to, but many would never open their minds and acknowledge their true passionate side to admit it. There is nothing dirty or immoral about this movie. So what, the affair maybe was wrong, but it was REAL, and it was BEAUTIFUL! This movie is for all of us that have a very strong passionate side to us, and never get to truly release it and be the real woman many of us long to be with that special man who recognizes it and knows how to give it back and make us feel loved in a way that no other man could ever make us feel.
