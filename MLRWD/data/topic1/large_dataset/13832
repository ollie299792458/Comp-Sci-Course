This was much better than the first movie. I liked it enough to purchase a Blue Ray copy.  One thing I didn't like was that they failed to show Galactus who is the Silver Surfers's boss.  There is a scene in the end where Galactus is supposed to be in the clouds but that was just plain dumb.

Speaking of dumb, I really hate how they change certain things and events and even people's skin color from the comics that I grew up with.  Some things are ok like having Spiderman shoot webbing from his body rather than from those cartridges that he invented in the comic book.  There is no way those small cartridges could hold enough webbing to go downtown and back let alone make parachutes and other items.  Also there was no way to tell when they were near to empty.  But changing a guys skin color is stupid as in the latest video game Ultimate Avengers, which features Nick Fury as a black guy.  He is white in the comics and should have stayed white (I'm black by the way)I don't know who the next villian will be but I hope they don't pick one of the weak ones (and keep featuring him in subsequent films)like the Goblin in the Spiderman movies.  FFROTSS is a step up from the weak, uninteresting first FF movie and may the next one be even better.
