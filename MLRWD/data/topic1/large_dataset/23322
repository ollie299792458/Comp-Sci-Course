I think anyone who does not already have a familiarity with this serial, should go into it with grounded expectations and not consider modern production standards not applicable to that period. Natives are stereotyped and often played by Caucasian actors (consider the era). The dialogue is your standard serial run of the mill - Sometimes stilted, but always fun. The Phantom is played by actor Tom Tyler who was best known for his role in the Captain Marvel serial. Monster fans know him best as "Kharis" in the 1940 classic "The Mummy's Hand". Unlike previous hero serials, Tom Tyler does have a convincing physique for the role and wears a costume that is pretty faithful to the basic look of our hero. The fight scenes are fun to watch and the storyline is far more engaging than most serials because they keep the story within the confines of the jungle which offers a variety of cliffhanger twists. Overall a very satisfying story that tries not to stray far from the source material. As serials go, I consider this one of the better efforts of that period. Ironic since it comes from Republic Pictures, who seldom respected the license they were using. But if your a Phantom fan looking for a good time, this should hit the mark nicely.
