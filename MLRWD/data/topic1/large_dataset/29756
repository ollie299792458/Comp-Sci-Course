alright.  this is what i call, "a very good movie."  it's not my favorite, or anything, but it's very awesome.  the quiet and definedly  cowardly protagonist, guy pearce, ends up in a tale of survival,  cannibalism, super-powers-type stuff, revenge, and gore.  while it is gory,  it's not unnecesary gore.  i mean, can you imagine a PG movie about  cannabalism?  anyways, the number of cannibals that spring up in the movie  truly do represent all reactions to being, essentially, forced into  vampirism.  it's not JUST a horror-gore film, though.  it also has it's  beautiful side to it.  the first few minutes make you believe it'll be a  care-free romp through blood-n-guts (namely because when the title of the  movie appears, it's in a vomiting scene instead of a really cool,  hard-hitting scene, like most movies), but by the end, when the last frame  fades away, and that music comes on, you're genuinely touched.  speaking of  the music, it's amazing.  it's what turned this from a good to a great  movie.  not that that is unsaid on this review page, i just felt obligated.  anyways, i'm thinking of buying it, so you should at least rent it.
