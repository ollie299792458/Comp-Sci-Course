This movie remains a great movie to pull out and watch from time to time as did I last evening and it is a shame that the DVD dishonors the real movie.Consequently, I still consider the theatrical version of the movie 5 star entertainment and I would undoubtedly give a properly remastered, theatrical release version DVD a 5 plus star rating, but my 1 star rating is intended to help further amplify how poor the quality of this DVD is and believe me I am not watching my DVDs on low end A/V equipment. So, I am joining the others who have posted regarding the quality issues of this DVD and who are spot on WRT "certain parts of the image appear to be `swimming' and `ghosting' where the computer has tried to restore missing picture information and where heavy noise reduction had been applied" and I cannot over emphasize how bad the soundtrack is. Both the Dolby 5.1 and DTS 5.1 soundtracks sound as if they were "DEMASTERED", not remastered, by first year film school undergraduates. The center channel volume is way too low and when adjusted to a reasonable listening level one is then overpowered when the other channels erupt with cannons, gunfire, etc., I'm talking window rattling here.

I am signed up to be notified when, if ever, the Blu-Ray version will become available and let's hope for the price gouging commanded by Blu-Ray that all of these issues are corrected, e.g.: The true theatrical release, high quality video image restoration and even higher quality audio restoration. What a disappointment it would be if the Blu-Ray is just a copy of the current product as has been the case with other so-called Blu-Ray releases. If a Blu-Ray version is released I would encourage Amazon to be as explicit as possible as to the quality level their customers will be getting from the Blu-Ray version.
