It starts out with a beautiful wedding where a very happy looking woman is walking down the aisle of an enormous, beautiful church. She is to marry a very handsome man that she seems to be extremely happy with. This woman is Sigourney Weaver. It seems all lovey-dovey, doesn't it?
The next day, the groom goes into work and comes across his recently employed secretary, who also just happens to be Love Hewitt. This may just be a coincidence, or it may be planned. I'm not going to give what happens away, because you gotta see it. But I am going to tell you that it was no coincidence.
In this movie, Weaver and Hewitt play a mother-daughter duo that, through many comedic ways, con men, preferably rich men, into marrying one so that the other can force a divorce. That way, they end up rich AND single, all ready for another con.
Almost every second of this movie is full of laughter. And if it isn't full of laughter, it's full of male drool (for the 2 main women, of course), which is funny anyway!
Plus, the DVD includes many extras, including an audio commentary and all the deleted scenes. And some of the deleted scenes they should have never gotten rid of because they're so funny! The commentary is really cool because it shows more to the movie than meets the eye, and the director, Hewitt, and Weaver all talk. The commentary is meant to be watched after you see the movie, because it itself is put over the movie. The actresses are talking about the various scenes while you are watching it(the movie), which I thought was really cool.
SUMMARY
In the end, it's just an all-around, funny flick. It may not be for the whole family because of the sexuality factor, but it certainly is entertaining for those that do watch it! Have fun, but I don't need to tell you that!
