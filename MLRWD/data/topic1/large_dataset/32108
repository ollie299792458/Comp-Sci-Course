Although not one of Hitchcock's best films, To Catch is Thief is still a very entertaining comedy/thriller. I really enjoyed watching it (and have actually seen it several times). Its features include a clever plot, great acting, several comic moments, and wonderful chemistry between Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. 
Essentially, To Catch a Thief is about a retired "cat burglar" (Cary Grant, charming as ever) who must clear his name after being accused of committing several more robberies. As he sets out to prove his innocence by catching the real thief, he comes across several intriguing characters - including a cool, sexy young American (Grace Kelly), her mother, and a beautiful French girl. To say any more would be to give too much away...
So, even though, as I said earlier, this is not one of Hitchcock's best (compare it with North by Northwest, for instance), it is still a very enjoyable and exciting film, greatly because of the wonderful performances and nice scenery.  I don't know how else to recommend this - get it and enjoy!
