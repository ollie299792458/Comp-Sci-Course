Honestly this is one of the greatest movies of all time.  A perfect combination of excellent art direction and inspiring writing.  The story line is refreshing because its spirit is very real and respects that life is messy and often does not have a perfect ending.  Although the timing of the story is in the wake of Vietnam, its message is very real for today.  At a time when getting pregnant at 15 without a husband sentenced a woman to a long vacation and a child she would never get to hold, the author never lost her spirit or drive to meet her goals and live her dreams.  It is an inspiration to young adults today - in that it illustrates that there are consequences for your choices and responsibilities that come along with them that could include losing yourself.  Through the terrific acting, heart-warming writing, and brilliant direction, the characters come to life and you feel their very real problems.  It is a movie that makes you think, but also laugh, and look inward of your own life, even if you do not live the situation, and reminds us all in a time where we believe we are immortal that we are indeed very human.
