The long running Inspector Morse series was not only a critical success but became a pop icon. So it is tempting to view the upstart Inspector Lewis series as an entertaining spin-off unlikely to equal the excellence of the original. I have viewed series one and two and like how the relationship between Lewis and his Sargeant Hathaway is being slowly developed with each episode revealing a bit more. The Morse series settled the Morse/Lewis relationship in just the first few episodes then settled into the fondly remembered abuse and affection, supporting and conflicting relationship. Because the relationship was settled so quickly,after the first few morse episodes, the viewer can watch the Morse episodes out of sequence and lose nothing. The Lewis episodes should be watched in sequence to get the full effect of the series. The Lewis episodes are more complex in that multiple nastiness in being perpetrated by multiple characters in each episode. In the first two series, I thought every episode was as entertaining as the best Morse episode. Don't be put off by Morse snobs. Give this series a try. I beleive it is actually better than the Morse series.
