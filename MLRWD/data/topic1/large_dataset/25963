The scenery and photography here are spectacular, to say the least. I saw the movie when it first came out, and I have owned Neil Diamond's soundtrack album for years and have loved it, have known it note by note. I play some of the songs. I have since earned a degree in music and am familiar with music from all genres, but this remains a favorite, a constant. It's nice again to see how the music relates to the visual aspects of the film. This film isn't for everyone. People who like fast action, gunfights, car chases, and such will find this film boring. However, if you can accept it for what it is, it's a beautiful experience all around. I don't mind the talking birds--remember "Babe," the talking pig? I like watching Jonathan working out his struggles in learning how to fly better, faster, higher and seeing him succeed. For me, it's a very uplifting movie. I only received it the other night, and I have already watched it five times. You might think of it too has an extended music video with all those gorgeous scenes--think wildlife, nature photography--together with the lush, mostly orchestral music. It's a different kind of movie. I know it has been ridiculed by many people for many reasons, but to some of us, it remains special. Like it says on the box, it is a movie with stunning beauty.
