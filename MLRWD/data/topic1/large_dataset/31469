Just finished watching season one of NIKITA on DVD and thoroughly enjoyed it, and am glad the series has been renewed for season two.  The stories are good, the plots are great, and the action is fantastic.  That said, I don't know why Division has so much trouble with Nikita.  Yeah, she causes trouble for the diabolical and power hungry Percy, and sabotages Division's missions, then escapes their clutches at the end of every episode.  However, if Division really wanted to capture Nikita, it's not that difficult.  As all us avid TV action series viewers know, CTU answers to Division and the director of Division could easily order CTU to hunt down and capture or terminate that pesky Nikita.  Now we know Nikita is good, but she's no match for Jack Bauer!  In fact, the dude now heading Division was sent to take over CTU several years ago and saved Jack Bauer's life by flying a nuclear bomb into the desert where it detonated away from a populated area, so Jack owes him a favor, which could be repaid by catching Nikita.  However, that could cause more problems for Division as Bauer is now a fugitive from the U.S. government and being a rogue agent himself, may collaborate with Nikita in her endeavors.  Team Nikita-Bauer would then be unstoppable.  What takes Nikita months to accomplish, Jack Bauer could do in just 24 hours.  Maybe that may happen in season three ;-)
