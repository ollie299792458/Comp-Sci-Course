I bought this for my... get this... 18 year old son. He loved it when he was young and still does! It's a nostalgic thing. He has always loved Looney Tunes and still does (he LOVES Pepe' Le Pew.) I like the Looney's myself. Brings back memories of watchin them in the 60's & 70's. Not even about the basketball just the fact that the Looney Tunes are in it (and Pepe' Le Pew) is why he loves it.

But anyway.. I wouldn't say that this is JUST for little kids. If your a fan of the Looneys or a fan of Michael Jordan... Your sure to like this movie! Now this is NOT a GREAT "GROUNDBREAKING" movie in anyway. But I don't think it was suppose to be. It's just fun & silly. It has humor for the little ones but also stuff that adults can understand. And it defiantly blows Mary Poppins out of the water! (Not that they have anything in common) just a reference since they're both live CG animation movies.

All in all if I could give it 6 stars I would! Anyone who gave this movie a rating of 2 stars or under are stupid! They can't understand good old fashion fun, with some good old fashion Looney Tunes humor! And it has Bill Murray in it. So you cant go wrong there.

GREAT - FUN MOVIE EVERYONE CAN ENJOY!
