And when you buy more films from the director to see other films he has done. In the Realm of Senses is one of those. Does it have pornographic images? Yes! It goes so far in showing sexual intercourse that many of the scenes could be taken out of a porn film, BUT and this is a huge but. These scenes are very very important and the film would not have worked without them. Here is a film where explicit sexual scenes are not an excuse to but necessity. Also, sex has probably never been filmed in such a beautiful way.

The whole film is in fact a fascinating love story. It is based on a true story about what any normal person would call insanity but Nagisa Ã”shima manages so well to show us their own logic that the whole thing becomes a mixture of beauty and terror.

The Blu Ray transfer is perfect, both sound and image and this is the uncensored version.

If you are easily offended then stay away, but if you like challenging and artistic films that stay with you for a long time then this should be on the top of your list.
