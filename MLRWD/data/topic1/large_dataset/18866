I ordered Ong Bak 2 based on the reviews I read here and on my previous experiences with Jaa's movies - I loved Ong Bak and The Protector. I just watched Ong Bak 2 last night, and I was extremely disappointed.

The first annoyance is that it seems like a good 20+ minutes go by before Tony Jaa even appears in the movie, let alone lays the smack down on someone. Once he does start dealing out whoopings, it's usually with the aid of some sort of weapon, which I don't find as entertaining as when he does it by hand/elbow/knee to the face. There are some good fighting scenes, but there is nothing to compare with the epic fight scenes of Ong Bak or The Protector.

The second and even more egregious annoyance is the overdubbing. Like the original Ong Bak, the movie was done in Thai and then overdubbed in English. The voice actors don't even have Thai accents... it sounds like they hired a bunch of people they found on the street to come read the parts. The overdub effort is so terrible and unconvincing that it is laugh-out-loud embarrassing at several points. It really makes it difficult to get into the story and enjoy it. I would recommend turning on the subtitles and leaving the original language, if that's possible on the DVD.

The story was rather strange and difficult to follow, especially because I bought the film to see some violence, not to enjoy a story. The ending wasn't even an ending... it just seemed like they ran out of money and stopped making the movie. I literally left the room for 2 minutes, came back and the movie was over. It almost didn't even have an ending.

I love Tony Jaa, but this movie really didn't do anything for me. I doubt very much that I'll ever watch it again. In fact, I was so disappointed after I watched it that I put the original Ong Bak in just so satisfy my Jaa-lust. If you're a fan, I would rent this one before buying. It's just not nearly as good as his other films!
