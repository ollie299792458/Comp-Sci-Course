This was a pleasant surprise.  I found myself laughing out loud, especially at some of the antics of Linus (Matt Damon's character).  It was fun to see the crew together again and up to their old tricks.  This time the stakes were higher, the technology more sophisticated, and the tricks sneakier.  A couple of new characters are thrown into the mix, plus some old characters brought in with new roles.  I was expecting a variation on the two previous movies, and to a certain degree this was true, but the whole fun of these films is to watch the gang in action (outlaying how many millions to get the job done? but isn't that part of the irony?), detail by minute detail as they lay out the plan, implement it, and meet all obstacles, foreseen and unforeseen.  The Brat Pack is a wonderful mix of personalities, each with his own unique gifts, quirks, and sheer genius.  My favorite is Linus, who has grown up since Ocean's Eleven (even if his folks have to bail him out regularly).  Of course, Danny Ocean and Rusty (Brad Pitt) are suave and, mostly, keep their cool.  Lots of action, clever plays, and even more clever dialogue.  You might want to replay it just to catch the bits of dialogue you missed the first time.  Highly recommended for anyone who likes to see that the house doesn't always win.
