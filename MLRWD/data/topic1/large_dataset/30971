Ok, I saw this film in 1989 and I was excited because it was supposed to be a far cry from the '60s Batman and it was. Despite my excitement, I just couldn't find a way to get into this movie. I expect all "superhero" movies to be as good as if not better than Superman The Movie. Batman is not close. For one, Michael Keaton does not fit the role of Bruce Wayne and even back in 1989 when I heard he would be Batman I was doubtful. Batman looks patheically weak in this movie. The bums at the beginning knock him down and seemingly out with thier handguns. He practically gets his ass kicked throughout the whole movie. It probably seems that way because you don't even get to see him (Batman)that much. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of The Joker upstages everyone else in the movie.The batmobile is cool and the batwing is awesome, which brings me to a couple of points. Number one, if this high tech machine is so badass, why does Joker stand in front of it while batman fires at him with machine guns and missles and come out unscathed? Number two, how does this machine become crippled by one shot from that rediculous gun that Joker pulls out of his pants? This movie must appeal to people who either don't know the batman comic or people who have never seen a well done superhero movie (Superman). It's not that it's not worth watching, but it is a disappointment. Batman Begins, on the other hand, is EXACTLY what I would expect from a hero that is supposed to be dark and mysterious. It is, in my opinion, the equivalent in 2005 to what Superman was in 1978. I only hope Superman Returns can live up to it's expectations. It would be a shame to tarnish the image that Christopher Reeve gave us in his films. I can't wait to see how Christopher Nolan handles the Batman sequels. I'm hoping that he rewrites history and reworks the story of Batman's rivalry with the Joker in the same fashion that he made Batman Begins. One can only hope.
