I am really impressed with the craft involved in the creation of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. I'm not sure if it would be possible to gather the quirky talents of all those illustrators again in order to breathe life into another childhood dream of the maker of this movie. Seeing the progression of his vision was an amazing journey.
My dad used to tell me about going to the movies on Saturday mornings to keep up with the serial adventures of honor-driven cowboys, bold & fearless space pioneers, and wiley private detectives. Sky Captain seemed to be the odd amalgamation of those serials run through a prism of Saturday morning cartoons from the 60s and transmitted onto a green screen past a handful of actors and a smattering of props.
I was so caught up in the fun of this movie that I bought several copies to share with those that I knew would appreciate it as I did.
Sadly, it looks like there will be no sequel to Sky Captain...but someone will reconsider this mode of film making again and I hope that they choose to do something heroic and not make the same pedestrian fare that gets slopped onto the silver screen by today's Hollywood hacks.
