After I ordered the DVD through this seller, I received a shipping date four weeks later!

Although their name is "Deep Discount" apparently the discount comes from never shipping the merchandise.

While the merchandise was below cost, I regret not having bought the same product through another vendor.

I was quite suprised after purchasing the materials, how very long they planned to take to complete the order.

There is simply no reason in this day and age that it should take four weeks to ship.

I ordered other blue-ray DVD through another seller on Amazon the same day and received those materials within a week of ordering.

Never, NEVER, use these guys.

As for the Tudors series - Fantastic!

I have viewed Seasons One, Two, and Four (all ordered the same date as the above through different vendors (Deep Discount DVDs was not one of them).

There is no "hero" in these episodes, as the character flaws and human vices are portayed and personified.

The bonus features which address the historical side, are very informative as well.

At times a bit graphic, but not overly gorey or prurient, a well done series that is very informative and closely follows the historical accounting of the era.
