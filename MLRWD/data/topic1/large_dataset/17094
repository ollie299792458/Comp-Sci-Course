That happens to be a line from the film, "Kentucky Fried Movie".  Tasteless, huh?  Yeah, well, so is the film.  But it also happens to be one of the funniest films of the '70s.  And also one of the most forgotten.  
The film itself is a collection of skits similiar to those of early  "Saturday Night Live" and "Not Necessarily The News" .  But, thankfully, there are no pesky TV censors to hold back any of the  vulgarity.  Some of the stars that are included in these unbelievably nasty  sketches are Donald Sutherland (JFK, Invasion of the Body Snatchers), Bill  Bixby ("The Incredible Hulk") and Tony Dow (The Beav!).  Also,  the film has many very funny moments.  Some of my favorites: "Fistful  of Yen", which is a cross between old Bruce Lee movies and "The  Wizard Of Oz" and "High Adventure" with explorer Claude  Lamont!  
The film was directed by John Landis, who went on to direct  "Trading Places", "Coming To America" and "Spies  Like Us."  The film also includes David and Jerry Zucker and Jim  Abrahams ("ZAZ").  They went on to do such classic spoof  comedies, such as "Airplane!", "The Naked Gun", and  "Hot Shots!"  
If you are a fan of any of these other titles  I've mentioned in this review and are not easily offended, then  "Kentucky Fried Movie" is for you!
