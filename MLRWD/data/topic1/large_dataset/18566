I really liked this movie. The setting in a misty northwestern Seattle-like town was great and expertly set the tone. A moody musical score with supporting music from punk/alternative bands was also good. I identified with the main character. I liked that he had personal aspirations and was willing to stand up to those close to him that discouraged his efforts. He also stood up against the high school gangsters for his weak little buddy. The guy was just cool.

The Invisible had a good mix of action and drama. Maybe the thing that turned most people off was the general somber mood and lonely feel. There are only a few core characters and other than the high school scenes most scenes only involve one or two characters. However the acting is good and the writer and director likely meant this to contribute to the mood of the film.

I may be one of the few Amazon voices that thought this show rocked, but consider giving it a whirl. It might just appeal to you like it did to me.
