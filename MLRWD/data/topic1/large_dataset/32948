James Mason, Ursula Andress, and George Peppard head this excellent cast.  It is 1918 and Germany as a nation is beginning to fall apart, despite the fact that many Germans believe that victory is still possible. Bruno,  played by George Peppard, has spent two years in the trenches before  becoming a German pilot.  At his new assignment he confronts class warfare  as well.  His unit is largely comprised of aristocrats holding a romantic  version of combat.  After all, they are gentlemen with a chivalric code.  Bruno sticks out with his aggressive plebian attitude and his realistic  approach to combat.  He sees no reason to honor two airman he has downed  above his own airfield. His years in the trenches did not allow that kind  of grand gesture.  There thousands would die in a day. 
The "Blue  Max," Germany's highest medal of valor will make Bruno the equal of  the others.  Political intrigue of the High Command, represented by James  Mason, gives an ironic twist to the opportunistic code of gentlemen.  Bruno  can be useful for propaganda.  The Red Baron, Von Richtofen, represents the  aristrocracy.  Bruno will represent the working class of Germany,  increasingly restless from harsh conditions at home.  
Bruno will also be  of use to Kaite (Ursula Andress) in a personal way.  She is attracted to  him because of his cobra like killing ability.  "Bruno, we have  tolerated you so far only because we have had to," says his major  competitor in the squadron also involved with Kaite.  Bruno will soon find  that Kaite like so many other things in that squadron is expensive, hard to  get, and may not be to his taste.  Filmed in Ireland in the mid 60's this  film has a good look to it.  For flying enthusiasts it is a must.  Jerry  Goldsmith's score, now available again on CD, is one of the great film  scores.
See it. Pour L'Merit.
