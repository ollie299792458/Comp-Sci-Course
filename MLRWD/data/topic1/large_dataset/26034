This is a truly wonderful animated story set.  They are some of the only things I allow my toddler to watch on video. The set is a mix of lovely classic stories, and some equally charming modern books.  Some of the older ones are done very simply (really more of a read-aloud of the story accompanied by music with the video panning over different parts of the original page drawings; simple but very nicely done) and others are tasteful animated adaptations of the original books.  All are well done, without all the hype and over-stimulation that is so common to most modern programming for children.  My two year old loves them.  You can feel as good about your child watching this as you can reading a book.  The read-along feature is great, so they're seeing the words as they watch the story just as they would in a book.  Quite a few the selections are also offered in Spanish in the bonus features section on each disc.  The music (much of it original for each story) is nicely done, classical and played by real orchestral instruments and not synthesizers, another detail I really appreciate that is hard to find.  The narrators include many well known actors, and all the narration is top notch. Buy these - you won't regret it.  And with 100 books in the set at this price, it's a steal for what you get.
