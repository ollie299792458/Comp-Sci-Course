The original interpretation of Red Dragon was entitled Manhunter.  It is typical Michael Mann fare from the 80's.  Lots of music video moments with people staring off into space while rock n' roll plays in the background.  It's just okay.  But this film, Bret Ratner's Red Dragon, is something more.  The novel on which it is based is very detailed in its descriptions of the killer's activities as well as those of Hannibal Lector.  Moreover, the techniques used to hunt him down are described with equal aplomb.  It is important, then, that this film explore those things in a measured and meticulous way.  And so they are.  Edward Norton turns in a fine performance as the tortured investigator with an unfortunate gift for seeing inside the minds of serial killers.  Anthony Hopkins as Lector is always enjoyable if a bit over-the-top and Emily Watson is intriguing as the blind film lab technician Reba who falls for Francis Dolarhyde.  And it is Ralph Fiennes' performance as Dolarhyde that gives this film its power and appeal.  He is clearly insane, on that point there can be no debate.  But once he finds a chance for love an acceptance through Reba he begins to doubt his transformation into the Dragon that has driven him to kill again and again.  Tom Noonan's performance in Manhunter was alright, but Ralph Fiennes nails it sinking deep into the character's paranoia and random flashing rage in a way that both terrifies and entrances.  Red Dragon delivers on the promise of Manhunter twenty years on.
