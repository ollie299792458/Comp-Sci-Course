The animation was excellent. The attention to character detail was brilliant. There were subtle touches of humor, there was sly and finely drawn character development, there was... almost no story. It's a brilliantly made, carefully crafted pile of nothing. It's hollow. Not that that's what dropped my rating; I've forgiven pretty, empty stories before on the basis of their charm.

This won't be a popular complaint, I'm afraid. I think the U.S. president was drawn with malice (and mockery) aforethought, which is the artist's right - but it's also mine not to like it, and I don't. My reaction - annoyance, disgust at the writers - snapped me out of the story, broke my absorbtion in watching. I don't like that. It smacks of clumsyness in telling the story, which is really irritating when the potential exhibited by the rest of movie was so high. And I wasn't expecting it, so I brooded on it and continued to be irked and really, it spoiled my enjoyment. If you're going to mock, I'd really prefer something either subtler or more in keeping with the feel and flow of the story. In this case their capitulating to the temptation towards mockery struck a jarring note and ruined the movie for me.

Maybe you won't care, or maybe having warning that that's in there will keep it from being a surprise that spoils it. It's still a nicely done movie - I liked the main charcter a lot, I liked how they portraied her, I liked the interactions and the characters. I was not impressed with the plot or the sillyness of their super-secret organizations. A massive British Library conspiracy could have been so much more than this...
