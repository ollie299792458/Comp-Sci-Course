This movies has to be Cuba Gooding Jr.'s best post-Oscar period movie. Most of the others have ranged from mediocre to bad stuff that bombed at the box office, but this movie did quite well in his run. Cuba is solid in his role of getting a struggling church choir to win a music contest to provide funds for his late relative's church. Beyonce is quite good in her role as she shifts from a sexy singing siren to a more spiritual gospel singer in that choir. Sometimes, she's not good in a few scenes, but this is one of her first movie acting roles, and she'll grow with time. And some of my favorite performers are in this movie, from my girl Faith Evans, to Shirley Caesar, who's still got it, to the mighty O'Jays, to my girl Melba Moore, who can still saaang it(!), and so forth! And a rare move in clashing the hard-edged,street grooves of rap with those jail convicts and the spiritual feel of gospel with the church choir that blend very well for that music contest they competed in! It's very moving, inspiring and uplifting, just makes you feel good at the end!
