Every movie set out to accomplish something; may it be entertainment, reflection of human conditions, or vehicle for performers. "Derailed" surely does a good job in entertaining its audiences.

The plot is classic for the genre and the twists are simply well cooked. Two people involve themselves in a situation which they cannot get out of because of another wrong doing. When viewers anticipate the final resolution, the film just makes another turn which gives us surprises and more to anticipate of. This is exactly what viewers expect from plot dependent movies.

Both Owen and Aniston gave satisfactory performance. If the details throughout the plot can be more supportive of the final ending and the two performers can provide more dimensions into the roles, this film would surely hit a higher note. Film like "Six Sense" would probably fall into the same category if not for its outstanding execution in these two areas.

If you have not seen it in cinema, this DVD deserves your attention.
