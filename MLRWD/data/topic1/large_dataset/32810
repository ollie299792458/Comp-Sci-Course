i'm biased.  i'm an adorer of anything done by robert altman.  so it is.  but this dvd somehow doesn't seem to do justice to this amazing film.  here are a few reasons why the dvd coulda/shoulda been better.
-the sound is kind of weird, the music sequences have high high volume and the dialogue is often too quiet at times that you have to turn up the volume on your set and then get a nasty jolt when the film cuts away to a music sequence.  and if you know how many times this movie goes back and forth between music sequences you can perhaps understand my frustration.  i understand that during robert altman's career and given his attention to dialogue and sound mixing a great deal of technical innovation occurred as a result of altman's efforts and contributions.  i think it would have been to his benefit (and his work's benefit) if he revisited this production and did something about the sound mixing.
-the film transfer doesn't seem to be all that grand.  certain scenes appear a little too washed out and bright and the colours seems distorted.  this as well would have benefitted greatly from developments in film production technology these days.
-the extras are so-so.  it seems as tho there would be mountains of praise for this film (actually i'm sure there is), interviews (20+ characters?  come on!), commentaries, additional scenes left out (altman actually refers to these on the disc) and it would be interesting to see some outtakes considering the scale and grandeur of altman's style especially with regards to this particular film.  and (again i'm being biased here) i would have loved to see some outtakes/bloopers with geraldine chaplin's character cos altman says in the commentary that a lot of her monologues (in the scrap yard, in the bus yard, elsewhere) were improvised.
anyway, i love this film.  i dropped the rating down one only star because i thought that the dvd could have been a little better and offered something special to those of us that understand the tremendous amount of tenacity and talent that culminates in a robert altman film.
so, get this dvd if you want the best currently available version of this film and to treasure it until hopefully another company (criterion? *wishing*) picks this film up as a project to restore and flesh out.
i hope this review has been useful.
