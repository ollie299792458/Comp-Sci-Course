This was all in all a great computer show. Starring Ryan Phillipe, Tim Robbins, Rachael leigh Cook (the only reson that I watched it), and Claire Fornali.
  Gary (Robbins), head of a corp. called NURV, developes the idea for a way to comunicate through every type of multimedia at any time called SYNAPSE. Lisa (Cook), plays one of Gary's most loyal employees. Milo (Phillipe) is a computer genius, who is part of this club in a garage with his friends Teddy and Brian, where they try and find out what makes certain organizations so BIG. Gary calls up Milo and asks him to come and work for him. Milo excepts. One night Milo comes home to his girlfriend ( Fornali)  crying to tell him that his friend Teddy's been killed. Milo is crushed, of course he doesn't know that Gary is behind it. In his journey her also befriends Lisa. Milo is doing so late-night-snooping around the NURV building one night and finds something he wishes he never had. Gary has private info. on everyone at NURV and he also waches every kid on the computer and kills anyone that comes close to putting him out of buisiness. That's how Teddy was killed. In his findings, he discovers that Lisa was molested at age 7 by her father. As her tells Lisa this, she pretends not to beleive him about Gary. She refuses to help Milo until he reveals that he know about her father. Then she helps him think of a plan. They finally decide to finish SYNAPSE so that they can tell the whole world at one time. After Milo finishes SYNAPSE, he finds out that Lisa was on Garys side the whole time and just used him to finish SYNAPSE by the release date. In the end he finishes SYNAPSE and gets it to the world that Gary is a killer. I don't, however, like the fact that Lisa went to jail though. Good show!
