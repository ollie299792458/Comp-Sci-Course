I was really pleased to find this movie in DVD form, as the book is one of my favorites. This adaption is very well done, keeping as close as possible to the original novel, and I'm really glad I bought it.

The animation on the rabbits in general is very good for the year it was made, but the real moments where this story shines are in the dark fantasies, delusions and flashbacks of the lapin protagonists. I'd be hard-pressed to find a more beautifully disturbing sequence in "animal cartoons" than the explanation given by one rabbit of how the old burrow was plugged up, and how the rabbits within suffocated- as we see the shades of these rabbits dig madly against each other towards the light they will never see, stylized and terrifying, you are shaken by how a story about bunnies can move you to a state of mental unrest.

That being said, aside from that one sequence, there is much here to enthrall any lover of the book or anyone interested in animation, or simply a story told well. Everyone in my family approved this movie, which is rare- we are quite the picky group.

Keep in mind, though: This movie is not something I would show to anyone under the age of, say, eleven or twelve. It is violent, occasionally extremely disturbing, sometimes nightmarish, and usually over the head of anyone under that age. Though a story about "talking animals", this is more along the lines of Animal Farm or the German movie Felidae: Bambi, it ain't.
