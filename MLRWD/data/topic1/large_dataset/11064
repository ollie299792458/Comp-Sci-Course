I am a huge fan of Tyler Perry's previous works. I just had the pleasure of seeing The Family that Preys, last night. Wonderful story and superb performances by the lovely Alfre Woodward and the solid Kathy Bates. They had a wonderful chemistry, and I really enjoyed their scenes together. Tyler Perry has a gift for keeping his stories real and heartfelt, and always throws wonderful nuggets of wisdom and truth in his movies.
Alfre Woodward's character was a beautiful example of a woman with a true Christian heart. No hypocrisy, and her scenes rebuking with the holy oil and the bible were laugh out loud funny. The acting was top notch by all the performers ( Robin Givens gives a fine performance as well, I always think she is unfairly judged.) The story is one that deals with real issues that face us as flawed human beings. I look forward to more of Tyler Perry's work in the future. For the most part his movies become better and better as he grows in his work. In this society that hails so many out and out stupid movies as genius, this is a TRUE gem that does not need to resort to excessive violence, sex, cursing because it is of such high quality.
