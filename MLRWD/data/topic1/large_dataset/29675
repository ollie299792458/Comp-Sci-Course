I was not sure what to expect from this movie, but the trailer I saw online caught my interest.  What I found was a movie with a deep lesson in forgiveness that went from profound to humorous by turns.

Through a set of circumstances, three hurting people find themselves together waiting out a snow and ice storm without electricity and with only one cell phone that is running out of battery life.  Each ends up coming face to face with the demons from their past that they are challenged to work through.  In the process they go from very serious moments to very humorous ones by turns, creating surprising moments for the audience.

I found the story to have great character development, and the acting was fabulous.  I thought that the main point of the movie, the importance of family and of forgiveness, was brought home very well.  Now that I know the ending, I look forward to watching this movie again, to pick out more lessons and notice more humorous touches that I found really added to the movie from an entertainment perspective.

I highly recommend this movie.
