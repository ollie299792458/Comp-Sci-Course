My all-time favorite musical, as I have performed it in pit-orchestra myself. A full-blown Hollywood musical spectacular complete with a built-for-the movie paddle-wheel "showboat". Every cast memeber gives outstanding performances, although in the film, the lovely Ava Gardner is "dubbed", it's done so well, you'll never notice it. There is a one-second "drop-out" about 15 minutes from the end (a transfer "glitch"), but it is the original full length, un-editied film. The Technicolor restoration is a bit "heavy-handed" and I suggest turning down the "color" (chroma) on your TV, or the colors are a bit "over the top". While not the same as the 1935 version (very hard to find and exspensive) it's one of my 5 favorite films ever made. The song and dance numbers by the Greyson's are close to Fred Astaire/Ginger Rodgers best. Pop a big bowl of pop-corn, get you favorite drink, curl-up on the sofa for about 90 minutes of great entertainment. Keep the tissues handy for Howard Keel's number with "Kim". Only regret is that it isn't the Super-Technorama very wide screen format.
