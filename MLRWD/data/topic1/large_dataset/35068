This is a film that gets better with age.
When it was first released in 1979, the original was considered a modern classic and Part 2 could not hold up.
As the years went by and Part 1 remained a classic Part 2 took even more of a dive in relam of critics.
Nevertheless, I believe that More American Graffitti has gotten a bad rap.
I feel that it's an honest depection of how "the old gang" grows up and matures and deals with the changes in life.
Especially in the 1960's when the innocence of 1962 changed so much with the culture of the mid and late 1960's.
This film drives home the message that even though we go are sepearte ways we always keep our true friends in our heart and never forget them.
Also, whether it is intended or not, every sequence has some sort of reconciliation on New Years Eve.
John is reconciled with is opponent who helps him get his car back on track.
Toad is reconciled with his superior officer who helps him go AWOL to be falsely reported MIA.
Debbie, although not reconciled to her boyfriend, finds new friends in her Ex's favorite band, who somewhat represents him.
Steve and Lauri reconcile to eachother and to their counter culture the Anti War Demonstateres.
A much deeper film that it's give credit for.
