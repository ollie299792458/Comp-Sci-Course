I just watched the movie, and I want my money back! Not only that, I want the time that I wasted watching this horrible movie back as well!  This movie is NOT based on the book, the book is pretty good, but the movie is truly an insult to the story in the book.  The movie tries to tell the story of the story of making a movie about a story... and has a really lame "present day" story in Shanghai, and a few "flashbacks" to the story told in the book.  The "present day" story characters are rediculous and totally unbelievable, and the present day story line consumes more than half the move.  As for the minute part of the movie where you actually see the original characters and the story in the book version of this story, well they obviously did not spend much time, effort or money on doing justice to the events portrayed.

If it were possible to give a "less than zero" review, this movie would get a negative rating.  It truly is insulting to call this movie by the same title as the book.
