BearCity is a tantalizing mix of love, lust, heartache and hope wrapped up in one exquisitely furry and fun package. Multiple plot lines are developed as the viewer is drawn into the personal lives of young chaser Tyler (Joe Conti) and his bearish love interest Roger (Gerald McCullough); a bear couple Fred (Brian Keane) and Brent (Stephen Guarino) weighing the pros and cons of opening up their relationship; and the intriguing pairing of superchub cum Southern belle Michael (Greg Gunter) and his adoring cub Carlos (James Martinez) as they deal with body image and health issues and their deleterious effects on obtaining gainful employment as well as acceptance in the community.

The movie vacillates between torrid romance, raucous comedy and tense drama, taking its audience on an emotional roller coaster ride through the ursine kingdom. Each of the characters is authentic, approachable and endearing in his own way. No real bad guys per se in this flick, except perhaps the delectable Spanish heartthrob Sebastian La Cause who, shortly after hooking up with Roger and agreeing to move in with him, proceeds to flirt with another guy, unaware that Roger knows of his infidelity and capriciousness.

Among the many factors that make this movie exceptionally appealing is its total lack of pretentiousness. No effort was made to cover up or gloss over the very real issues burly gay men and their admirers face. The characters are truly representative of the men who make up the bear community, with all their foibles, idiosyncrasies and shortcomings.

I highly recommend this movie and firmly believe you'll be entertained, encouraged and inspired.
