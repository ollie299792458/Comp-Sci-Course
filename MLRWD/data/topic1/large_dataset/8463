Woody Allen follows in the steps on Ingmar Bergman in filming the falling apart of women and sisters. The sisters are all very much different from each other. Joey [played by Mary Beth Hurt in a performace that makes me want to gag.] is the sister who can not find herself, even though we're told she has so many talents. You just feel like smaking her and saying, "Hey, there's people who have it a lot rougher than you out in the world." The two best things about this film are Geraldine Page and Maureen Stapleton, who were both nominated for Oscars. Stapleton plays the fathers new love interest who isn't like by the whole family, but ends up winning them over. Page brilliantly plays the fragile and distraught mother who is on the verge of suicide. The ending scenes are unavoidable as the story progresses. A great film to watch if your a fan of Allen's or Bergman's. It's also a great film to watch if your a fan of Geraldine Pages.
