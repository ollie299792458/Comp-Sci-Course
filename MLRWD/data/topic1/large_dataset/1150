My only complaint about "The Donner Party" is that is not large enough in scope. It's only a snapshot of that nightmarish winter, but wow what a snapshot it is. If you are a Crispin Glover fan thinking this is some weird gore-fest, forget about it. This is a (not exactly, ha) historical retelling of the Forlorn Hope party that set out in a pathetic attempt to rescue the ruined remains of the westward immigrant farmers from Ohio who had a really, really bad time of their journey.

It's an amazing achievement. You will forget Crispin Glover is in this movie, as he disappears into his role as William Foster. The rest of the cast is just fantastic and I expect great things will come to them. Mr. Eddy, I don't know your name in real life, but you should go slap Brad Pitt and show him how it's done.

Yeah, I was a little annoyed at the abrupt and historically incorrect ending, but seriously, who cares? This was a movie than needed to be made, and it has been made extremely well.

Thanks to all involved.
