At a glance:
"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time" is a film that explores that desire we all have to go back and change how certain events worked out in our lives.  The main character find herself to have this ability, but how did she get it, and what if any complications are brought about by changing things?  The film is another exceptional work by director Mamoru Hosoda, who has been pegged by many to be the director to succeed the great Hayao Miyazaki in directing.  Incredible acting, complimented with great story telling, with vibrant backgrounds and animation make this film a classic that all ages can enjoy.

Some details (and spoilers):
This film in particular brought about my interest in director Mamoru Hosoda, as he delivered an exceptional film that is easy to recommend to others.  Often times with anime films you really need to consider the content, the genre, and the associated appeal, whereas I don't even consider these when suggesting this film to others.  It has an appeal that exists at different levels, both to younger audiences, as well as older audiences, all the while maintaining a sense of good pacing and timing that keep you genuinely interested in the characters.  The idea of going back in time has unfortunately obtained something of a stigma, but this film goes above that by not using time machines, and not altering world history.  The main character wishes to change the events in her life not out of her desire for greed or power, but for some very relatable reasons that help you to feel empathy toward her and what she is going through.  Ultimately the film begins to address some of the consequences that her actions have had, and you're left feeling as though you gained something from the experience  I found myself enjoying all elements of the film and I didn't have trouble "getting into it" or being distracted at points that weren't done correctly.  This film had a lot of love go into it, and I believe that's why many have taken so well to it in return.

Pros:
* The high definition version is crisp, clear, and really shows off the beautiful palette used for this film.
* Voice acting on the dub and sub were both incredibly well done, the emotion of the characters came through, and didn't feel forced.
* Bonus features are included with this release on the DVD that comes with it (this does not include the DVD version of the film)
* Great story, good pacing, and effective directing establish this film.

Cons:
* The release is not a DVD/Blu-Ray Combo
* The features included are on a DVD rather than a Blu-Ray
* While not incredibly expensive, the Blu-Ray is still a little more expensive than maybe it should be for a movie.
