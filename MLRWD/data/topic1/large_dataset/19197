This is the travelogue version of the venerable novel by Stacpole. It's the sort of movie to make you want to buy a ticket for a tropical holiday. Think of it as soft porn in the sun.
The young Shields plays the part of a girl marooned on a deserted tropical island, with the gorgeous hunk of Chris Atkins as the boy marooned with her. At the time of marooning, the kids are quite young so the movie inserts the character of Leo McGuigan (famous as Rumpole of the Bailey) to nurture and guide them.
Years pass in paradise, the old guy dies, and the kids grow up. Lots of flesh show as they sport on the beaches. Shields and Atkins show their buff bodies to good advantage. In one notorious scene, Atkins sits naked in Shields' lap as they slide down a waterfall, displaying all of his goodies.
The kids discover sex, do it as much as they can, and have a baby. Talk about Adam and Eve!
The bad guy shows up as a pearl fisher, who exploits Atkins to dive for the pearls without knowing their value.
Eventually the kids, and their young son, get rescued. But at the end of the movie, they return to their island paradise.
Gorgeous photography, equally split between flesh and scenery. Good for a cold winter's night, what with tropical scenery and sexy bodies to warm the viewer's heart.  END
