Big trouble has got one of the best plots I've seen in a while for a comdy. Starting out with a character named Puggy who used to live in a box eating fritos explaining the story of Noah's ark. The story is then narrarated by Tim Allen's character, with explainations and introductions on other characters as they come into the two day plot. As Allen put when introducing a character, "he was on of the few Floridians who was NOT confused when he voted for Pat Bucanan." The story then goes on to introduce a barage of characters including Allen's son and his two friends, a maid, two burglars, two russian weapons dealers, two cops, a carnival security officer, two hitmen (one well played by Dennis Farina), and of course, Puggy.  The story takes place when the two burglars eventually get hold of a bomb about halfway through the movie. A chase ensues and the laughs just keep coming. Johnny Knoxville plays on of the stupid burglars/kidnappers, and in one scne asks a man what knot he would like to be tied up in. The movie has many twists and turns to keep anyone guessing. And in the special features section you can watch the key parts of the film in approx. 8 minutes. You don't miss too much and everything is understood. Overall, a really good comdey that has good comedy for teens and adults.
