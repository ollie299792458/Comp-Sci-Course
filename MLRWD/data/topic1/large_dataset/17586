I missed seeing this movie in the theater. I did see it when it was showing ON HBO. BUT it was not 3D I later learned that the 3D in this movie was close to Avatar 3D. I wanted this in 3D, but I wanted the BLU-ray 3D+BLU-ray+DVD+UltraViolet that are big when a movie first comes out, but it was well past the release date. But Amazon to the Rescue they still had the release day Version not just a 3D BLU-ray or 2D BLU-ray or the DVD version, YES! Well to say I was in impressed would be lie. Is the on track with Avatar 3D yes is it as good as Avatar 3D, No. But it was very well done. The use of 3D was not just to draw you in with some artsie-fartsie way but used as pop and depth, it was used in a very good way and it did put you into the movie with the use of 3D in the best way when the Dragon was being ridden. The 3D when flying with the Dragon is where they show off the 3D in this movie. Would I have been more impressed if it was done in Avater fashion,  Yes but the full on 3D when the Night Fury was flying was so good that it puts the movie in the just under Avatar in 3D but equal to Avatar 3D no. But it is a fun flick to have for those day's when you want to kick back and just watch a very well made 3D. I give the 3D 4 stars out of 5 stars, Video and Color  I gave it 5 out of 5 stars due in part to no colors bleeding in 3D & 2D, the audio 5 out of 5 stars. In total I give the movie 5 star's.
