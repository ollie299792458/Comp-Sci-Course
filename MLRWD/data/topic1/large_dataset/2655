What a great film.  From start to finish I hung on every word, every frame.  I'm a great Spacey fan, and to his credit he meets his usual standards, but the directing, the cinematography, and the story  itself all blend like some fantastic symphony.
Spacey plays Prot, a mental patient who claims to come from the planet K-Pax in another solar system. He's crazy right?  Well that's part of the beauty of this film.  The story leads the viewer down a path of Prot's mysterious understanding of the orbital mechanics of a binary star system, and a psychotic phobia of water sprinklers, flip flopping the viewer's opinion of Prot's true nature.  Alien or Psychotic.  Brilliantly done.
There is some amazing cinematography.  Although I watched the VHS version I recommend purchasing the DVD to get the full effect.  The "modified to fit your screen" mutilation, just doesn't do it justice.  One shot in particular shows the obsessive compulsive (I forget his name) with the background distorted by his thick glasses.  It's really beautiful.  Could be a poster.  There are also many cut scene's shot in fast forward, mostly of clouds, marquee's, and tailights.  I generally consider this sort of filming as too MTV trendy for my tastes, but I understand now that it fits with the main point of the movie.  Life is fleeting and not to be squandered, much like American Beauty.  Enjoy life.  Because in the end, we only get one shot at doing it right.
