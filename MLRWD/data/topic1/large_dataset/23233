I like this film and whenever it appears on TCM I watch it again.  It is kind of quirky - certainly not just a romantic comedy, but there are some parts that are stilted.  It's too bad that Cary Grant had such classic good looks because it made it inevitable that he play leading man roles.  I think I've seen almost every Cary Grant film and he has never played a romantic lead successfully.  That scene on the train in North by Northwest - ugh. He is not romantically believable in People Will Talk, Charade, To Catch a Thief, The Philadelphia Story, Suspicion, Father Goose, Notorious etc.  He should have been portrayed as the essential bachelor.

On the other hand he is a fine actor.  Being slotted into romantic leads allowed him to relax into a sterotype.  He would have been great in action films, comedy (Arsenic & Old Lace) or anything else that would have stretched him as an actor.  While he was not particularly successful as a romantic lead in this film, People Will Talk, he was first-rate as an unconventional physician and wonderfully exuberant as a conductor.  The film is still worth having in any library
