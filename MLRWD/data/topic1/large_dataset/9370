"House of 1,000 Corpses" is a horror film that loves the horror films of the late '70s and early '80s.  It uses all their trappings (and makes a few more unwelcome ones that detract from the picture) to make a film that is sure to satisfy horror fans.

The plot is fairly simple: Some teens want to check out a roadside attraction.  It leads them into the hands of a demented family that is not above torture and murder.  Simple and effective.

Rob Zombie, the director, has taken a lot of grief over this film.  The studio refused to release it, fans criticized him for it, and the general public pretty much stayed away from it.  Their loss.  Zombie knows what makes a horror film work, and as a first effort, they don't get much better than this.  Sure there are problems, but those problems have nothing to do with the tone (as the film's first studio said), and they have nothing to do with lack of frights (as some horror fans have claimed).  They have to do with Zombie trying to do too much in one film.  My guess is that he thought this might be his only shot at making a movie (and for a while, that looked to be true), so he threw in everything in an attempt to make his mark in horror history.  Sometimes it works.  Other times it doesn't.  Overall, though, the film is quite effective.  (And all you Dario Argento fans, see if you can spot the shot that seems directly inspired by the director.)
