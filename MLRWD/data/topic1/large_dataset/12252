This is one movie that will become and instant family classic.  It's a tender movie, with some hilarious moments, and a nice story line.  The movie is about a young adult girl named Molly, played by Brittany Murphy who loses all her fortune overnight, when her lawyer runs away to South America with all her money and the money of ten other clients.
  Molly is left with no other choice but to find a real job, sell some of her many frivolous posessions to afford a space at her best friends apartment, and grow up real fast.
  She gets a job as a nanny to and eight year old girl, who acts like a very old and mature woman, and is a total nut case about germs, organization, and cleaninnes.  The two worlds of these uptown girls will come to a clash through the movie.
  Through the movie the relationship of this unlikely duo will grow and mature several times.  This movie is simply beautiful and has a natural feel good tone about it.  It leaves you almost in tears at the end, and wishing for a little more.
