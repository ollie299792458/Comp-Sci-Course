When I read all of the bad reviews about the quality of the DVD for season 10, I was expecting something of inferior quality. But I must say that the quality is still good, although I can tell it was not remastered with the same technique as seasons 1-9. I'm not sure why they decided that, but to say that it's bad quality is simply an exaggeration. The quality's fine. I enjoy watching it. I also enjoy the stories.

I don't agree that the stories are not as good as previous seasons, they're just different. I like the direction that Jack Lord took the show after the first producer, Freeman, died halfway through the run. The later seasons from season 8 are less violent, more human interest stories, and use more cultural references of Hawaii throughout the islands. And there's some exceptional episodes in these later seasons that demonstrate an ability to experiment with pushing the envelope. An example is season 10 "A Short Walk on the Longshore" that, in my opinion, ranks among one of the best episodes in the entire 12 year run. So it's worth getting this season. Don't let the bad reviews stop you from getting this season. Make up your mind for yourself.
