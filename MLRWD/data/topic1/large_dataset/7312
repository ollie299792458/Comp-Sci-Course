For a guy who never went to film school, worked at a video store, make a low budget gangster film and get huge success out of it, astonishes me. Quentin Tarentino's first movie is one of my favorites, and it's a perfect homage to gangster movies of the 40's and 50's. What's good about this movie, is that it doesn't have the lame aspects of those earlier films. It pays homage to them, yes, but it also has a contemporary feel to it. 
Anyway, the movie is about a group of guys who plan to rob a bank. They don't know each other, they're just in on the money. Later on, they get set up and the robbery is a failure. Two of the guys, Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) want to know who set them up. 
The movie is really fast-paced, save for a few scenes with the mob boss and the conversations. And it also takes place mainly in a garage. I really love the low budget feel of the movie. It's almost like Mean Streets (best film ever), and the acting is superb. Lawrence Tierney has the best role ever, and acts it out like a true pro would. The movie also has a pretty graphic torture scene (though the violence isn't as graphic as Man Bites Dog, or A Clockwork Orange.). Everybody was perfect. I used to hate Quentin Tarentino as an actor, but I now think he did a good job. Good movie.
