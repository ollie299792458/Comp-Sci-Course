This movies is great because it just protrays Quebec as it was in the 60's and 70's.

I remember that htings were liked that and I knew several families just like them

where dad is making a good living in the construction business. Then, these construction

guys were most of them fitting the macho profile. The high school life was also just like shown

with those leader guys always making fun especially of the sensitive or intellectual boys

to the point of violence. Those were the days.

You could see that anyone had a high quality of material life because everyone had money

but it was difficult to be different. It is also the fact that Zac's catholic mother would

finally be the understanding person that would accept Zac's evolution. It is quite true that

in North America, living a very rich material world can hide a very poor capacity to true

relationships.

It is also a great film about the true sense of family where the dad-boy relationships are

so important abd that the men, in those days, were so unprepared to cope for. It is a movie that

shows how much change that the Quebec society has lived. What is so great about this film is that knowing

that all these people were true with themselves, they could not do better than what is seen.
