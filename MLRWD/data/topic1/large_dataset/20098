I never liked western movies, and I don't think i'll ever like it. well I only like it when there is a shoot-out. Like when there are some people in the bar fighting for some little thing, so they are just shooting at each other or killing themselves with knives. When they start fighting I start liking it a little bit, but then they just start talking and I just ignore it.  I only like scary movies because they are interesting they don't get boring because it's scaring you every time. The only thing Ilike about the movie was the soundtrack ( even though it didn't scared me when it started). The soundtrack sounded like ... whoa.  I think it would have been better if it was louder. I am not sure what I should recomend to the people, just that it was kind of good because of the shoot-out, the rest I don't know I thaught it was boaring because there was no action they were just talking about I don't know what.  In the movie I look for it to be scary ( even though I get scare in the night) for it to have a great sountrack and the soundtrack to be loud sothat it could scare the kreep out of you. What amkes the movie suck is if it doesn't have no action, and if they just talk and don't do anything interesting. Like in the movies in black and white, those one really suck no ofense but they don't do anything interesting they just talk and talk.  What I also look for in a movie are good actors because some actors are to nervous or forget there lines. I like alot of different type of movies like scary the ones of karate and craft movies. It sounds better with the soundtrack and very loud ( more when there is a scary part , I don't know what to recomend you just that if you like movies with action don't waste your time and money on it.
