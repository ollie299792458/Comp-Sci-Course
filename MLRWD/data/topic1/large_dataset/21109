Peace. Love. Freedom. Happiness. Oh, the cynics and weltschmertz-besmudged who dislike this flower inspired by the flower-power era!
I like this film more than the original musical. I enjoy the film each and every time I watch it. I enjoy the cinematography. I adore the acting. The dancing is transcendent. The irony and tongue-in-cheek critique of the Sixties, as well as the capturing of the spirit of that peculiar American era, are lovely.
I was nine when Diane Keaton was performing "Black Boys" on Broadway, and I wasn't part of the hippy scene. I'm glad: the excesses of the era led to great tragedy. (Read Philip K. Dick's novel A SCANNER DARKLY for one brilliant analysis of this.)
But the joy and the hope of that Romantic era never have fully been rekindled. Though Tricky Dicky was slushfunding; though Mi Lai, Kent State, Bobby Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, Jr., made horrible backdrops for my own despoiled childhood innocence--there was Hope: The Bad Guys might not win; Love and Understanding might predominate; perhaps we all might be able to live as brothers and sisters. Perhaps prejudice, hatred, war, greed, shame, terror, will die; perhaps kindness, togetherness, peace, honesty, and joy will reign.
Yes, the Bad Guys ALWAYS win. Yes, this vision of a Better World is sophomoric. Yes, Christ always will be crucified; Buddha will be worshipped; the Temple will be destroyed, and the rivers all will run with blood.
But my heart still sings along with the song, "Good morning, starshine! The earth says Hello! You twinkle above us--we twinkle below."
Eternity is just long enough for a joke says Hesse--and what better jokes than the Sixties themselves and this lovely film which captures its spirit and energy.
May the swords be beaten into ploughshares; may the sun shine in; may Jupiter align with Mars. Forever.
