If you haven't spent your life in a hippie community, it is unavoidable that you become a part of some certain social circle, abandoning the  possibilites of the other social group. The relationship between these two  social groups isn't necessarily hostile, but often the groups don't share  too high respect towards the others. Now, as far as I understand, this kind  of a situation is most common in the states where you unavoidably find  yourself chatting with the sport junkies, the nerds, the hippies or such.  This movie is a fantastic description of that situation, and an exciting  example of some sort of alternative social circle. As I watched the movie,  I often found myself impressed by the unity of the group, although there  aren't so clearly divided social circles in Kitee's Lukio (senior high), or  if there is, at least it ain't so hostile as bac there. Anyway, the film  itself was most entertaining piece of "art" and featured plenty  enjoyable and hilarious moments, but what really made this movie stick into  my mind was the forementioned alternative anarchy. Something I admire.  Truely.
