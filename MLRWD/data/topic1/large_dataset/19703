Story: Story about two street huslers, Mike and Scott, who sell themselves to men or women, in other words, rent boys. Mike keeps dreaming about his mother who abandoned him as a child and suffers from narcolepsy. Scott is the son of the mayor and only does what he does to embarass him. Together they go on an adventure to find Mike's mother, travelling from Idaho all the way to Italy.
Opinion: I have only seen this once and I wasn't really into the movie the way I thought I could be. The only reason I rented it was to see River Phoenix performance. The way he played his character was very believable but I can't say the same for Keanu Reeves. But Reeves has grown up and has improved by a long shot. My tip is to watch reruns of this movie to fully understand the story.
 You'll either really hate this movie because of the dialogue and/or the techniques used, or really like it. If you're a fan of River Phoenix, I strongly suggest you to watch it because his acting is incredible. There's a chance you'll be confused whether you liked it or not because this isn't a film that you will understand the first time played. Watch it again, maybe your opinion might change.
 There's alot of nudity in this movie but they're frozen when they are. I was a little uncomfortable when watching those scenes but they didn't run for long.
 If You're still not sure whether you'll like this movie or not, just rent it at a video store. Make sure it's a DVD because the video version that I borrowed was really bad.
