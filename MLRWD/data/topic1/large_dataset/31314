I have seen the other version of the big blue and there was alot of empty spaces in it key parts of the movie that made it hard to understand. But the directors cut filled in those empty spaces and made those scenes they left out more understandable. The directors cut is a much better version of the movie and if you have never seen this movie before I recommend you see this version first. The music was much better in the first version I do have to say that. It was more mysterious and comforting in the other version this one was to upbeat it was more like disco to me. I loved the characters Jean Reno is one of my favorite actors. Im not sure why Jean Marc Barr's career didnt take off I thought he was wonderful in this movie.Rosanna Arquette well she was ok but I think they could have casted her part a lot better with someone else. All she did in this movie was giggle and scream to the top of her lungs. She was like listening to fingers nails going down a chalk board. My appologies to all the Rosanna Arquette fans I didnt mean to offend. It was a great movie and throughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to anyone. I would give it a 5 plus.
