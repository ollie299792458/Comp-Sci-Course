As a New Yorker, I thought I would really enjoy this story about a push cart vendor in the city.  I see these guys everywhere and have regular vendors I buy things from and I thought this movie would not only realistically depict their life but also my city.  Sadly I was mistaken.  First of all, most of the movie was so dark that often it was impossible to see what was going on.  Yes, the lead character Ahmad did start his days at 3 a.m but by the time he got to work, it was much later in the morning when the sun actually does come up in the city, even in the month before Christmas. But watching this film you would never know that, since almost all the outdoor shots are at night. Perhaps it was cheaper to film then, but besides showing an inaccurate view of NY, it also made it difficult to see much of the action.

In addition, so much of what was going didn't really make sense.  We don't get enough of the background of the protagonist to know what his motivations are, and when we do see things, there isn't enough explanation.  Without wanting to explain the character's unfathomable behavior which leads to the climax, either no explanation was given (or I missed it) about how he ended up working in a club, taking tickets, or his mother-in-law's extreme antagonism toward him, for instance.  I'm sure that many of these push cart vendors in NYC have difficult lives, but this movie neither illuminated fully their life in general or of the main character's in particular. It was a disappointment
