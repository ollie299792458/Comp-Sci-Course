I saw this with my two older children, boy-13 girl-11. Before we saw it, they had many questions which I sought ot answer by going online. We found a site about Aushwitz, the camp in which the events of the movie take place. This was thier first exposure to the Holocaust. Having given them some of the horrific background surrounding those in the movie enabled them to understand better what was going on.

It was a great movie and my kids agreed. They watched it a second time. The thing I liked about the movie was the fact that the film used the Holocaust as a backdrop, not as some politcal statement. It was there, just not in your face.

The story was captivating, the ending completely unexpected. The three of us who watched it had a completely different ending envisioned. But I think as it unfolded, it made the movie much more powerful.

Excellent, and I think kids could watch this without too much after affects. But an adult who understands what is going on needs to be present in order to explain what is going on.
