Thankfully, they didn't decide to name this movie Rocky VI, so we can forget that the fifth one ever happened.  This unexpectedly good followup (but hopefully finale) to the Rocky saga is a real treat.

In the first two Rocky movies we had the real story.  A rags to riches fighter dealing with family and money and fame.  Sure it's simple and plays like a soap opera, but it's the simplicity of it all that's great.  The fighting was about dignity and pride.

Rocky three, while perhaps the most fun of the franchise, can't be taken as seriously.  Pitting Hulk Hogan and Mr T. against Rocky was entertaining, but pretty much just fluff.  And Rocky IV was way too cheesy for me.

With Rocky Balboa, you can forget all the pro wrestlers and the Russian steroid driven He-Men.  The soul is back.  Here we have Rocky dealing with his dead wife, his relationship with his son and making corny but heartful motivational speeches to his loved ones around him.  Surprisingly, it all works really well.  Even before the actual fight takes place, or is even proposed, it's hard not to be sucked up into Rocky's story of hardship in Philidelphia.

The fight that takes place is between the old retired champ and a cocky young fighter, Dixon, who wants to use the match to gain popularity.  Dixon encourages Rocky to keep the fight simple so he can lose with dignity, but of course Rocky has none of it.  Here he is out to shed the demons of his past and prove to himself one last time that it was all worthwhile.

Overall, this movie was really good; a great last harrah for the frachnise.  Did this movie need to be made?  Probably not, but with a bitter taste left in our mouths from V, it's good to have a real finale to this saga.  The fight itself was good, but a little by the numbers and not as gritty or edge of your seat as we've seen from previous outtings, which really is the only reason for the missing star.  But I recommend this to fans of the franchise and welcome it in my collection.
