And that's NOT an under-statment on my part. Rick Moranis, Ellen Greene, and Steve Martin were great in this film, and made me watch it again and again! Skid Row (Downtown), Dentist!, Feed Me (Git It), The Meek Shall Inherit (Though I perfer the un-cut version), and Mean Green Mother From Outer Space were great, and the special effects were wonderful. A great movie for it's time!
Little Shop of Horrors (Also called LSH or LSOH for short) was a great film. It's about an evil, man eating plant from outer space who has set his goals on taking over the world. (Or eating it, to be exact.) Audrey 2, the plant, starts out by being a seemingly harmless plant that just so happens to show up at the "Old Chinese Man"'s store after the total eclipse of the sun. When Seymour is picking up a bundle of roses down where he lives, cuts his finger and begins sucking the blood from it. Audrey 2 notices, and begins making sucking noises. From then on this plant feeds on human blood, ranging from a sadistic dentist, to the nearly-harmless Skid Row flower shop owner.
This movie will keep you in stiches from beginning to end, with great preformances from Rick Moranis as Seymour, Ellen Greene taking back up her part from stage as Audrey, Steve Martin as the sadist dentist, Orin Scrivello D.D.S, who is Audrey's boyfriend who sports leather and a motorcycle, and Vincent Gardenia as Mushnik.
