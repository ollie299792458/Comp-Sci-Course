This remake with slightly different plot twists, modernized dialogue and a much faster pace definitely gives us movie buffs something to argue over at IMDB. Each one has its place in the representative period of time. As a baby boomer, though, I have to spend my DVD cash on the original.

"Miracle on 34th" has been remade before this one, as a TV version with David Hartman as the lawyer  in 1973 - many normally discerning viewers liked that one too. Fundamentally, the basic story is calls out to almost all of us. We should be thankful that more Christmas movies aren't remade...well, never mind because they all are (I can't wait for Charlie's Angels to have "A Wonderful Life.") Teens and younger may prefer the faster pace of the 1994 version, but I thought the original had more sincerity, more nostalgia (I remember Gimbel's!), much more heart...and the real Santa Claus.

All versions of the movie are based on the book of the same name by Valentine Davis - I highly recommend it. It's an easy read and there's a reason we all feel so fondly for one version of the movie or another.
