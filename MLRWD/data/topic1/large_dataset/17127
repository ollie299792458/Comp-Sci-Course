One of the better X-Men Movies to come along.  May just be the best one aside from, maybe the first. It explains the origins of, and the basis behind the relationship between Professor-X, and Eric Lensher(AKA-Magneto), the creation of "Cerebro", and the beginings of their school for the gifted.

Among the many cool characters of "First Class", most notably we see the origin of Beast, very cool. We meet the devilish Azazel, who is Nightcrawler's father, and who can also teleport. And we get to see just how Professor-X becomes paralyzed and ends up in his iconic wheelchair.

One of the coolest things about the movie is how it is anchored in actual historical events, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, and how they interweave real w fiction. Another is the more comic-book-esque, authentic, yellow and blue costumes they adapted for this incarnation, which were done very nicely. You also can't go wrong w the casting of the main characters, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as Prof. X and Magneto. Two legit actors that give the movie credibility and strength.

Overall an excellent movie, esp if u like comic-book based movies. Interesting story, great actors, good execution, and def some super cool, mutant action..! Def a great one to own..!!
