David Fincher's pacing and cinematography is worthy of praise. This movie written by David koepp is a stunner. Jodie and Forest whitaker shine as the stars. It is a simple cat and mouse game yet not a minute of the movie deviates from the suspense. It is the minimality of digression that is the key here. The director does not leave the story line to chase any ponderous or emotional moments. From when the burglars enter the house till the very end the suspense refuses to die. The concept of the panic room, the strong hold, the very room the burglars are after is novel. In many places in the movie the tables are turned and the movie goes from jodie's character has upper hand TO burglars have upper hand  sitation. In the end Jodie's character goes into the Bruce Willis Die hard mode. One pitted against the gang where she has to outwit them. The movie is violent and brutal in the scenes where it is necessary. The fun is in how the burglars try to get Jodie's character to come out of the panic room. Nicole Kidman was originally to star in the role of Meg Altman (Jodie), but had to back out due to a knee injury she sustained during the filming of Moulin Rouge. However, she did add her voice to the movie portraying Steven Altman's girlfriend and talking with Meg Altman on the phone. The movie is fully shot in a house and it's amazing how even without change of environments,sets and no expensive costume design,  one is still glued to the screen. The location is still the same house. So where lies the gem ?. The gem is in the suspense and plotting and in the deep seated desire of every movie goer to see the underdog win.
