I liked this movie.  There were some minor plot holes and it did slow down once or twice, but 99% of movies are no different.

What I enjoyed most was that even though it used elements from several well-known movies or books, the makers were brave enough to do some things drastically different, even if it didn't always work.

I think it is laughable to compare this movie to the Matrix. I think that years from now Equilibrium will still be discussed and debated with all of its flaws, while the Matrix will probably look and feel dated.  If you think about it, this is a very old and often copied story:

The young man (the One) who performs miracles and who will save us all. Hmmm.

Now I do love the Matrix for what it is. The timing of its release was perfect and it had the feel of something new from Hollywood. I don't see, however, why a person can't like both movies.  Is this a competition or something?  People actually seem angry that they are reminded of the Martix when they watch Equilibrium!  After my second time seeing the Matrix, I was reminded of Dark City, but I didn't get upset by it.

Another note:  Another reviewer wrote that if there had been no Matrix, there would have been no Equilbrium - I submit if there had been no Dracula, Dark City, Blade, The Last Dragon or any other movie that featured skilled fighters, an important mythology or tragedy, gothic trappings, long coats/cloaks and one person who is the best of us or the "One", there would have been no Matrix.

To end, I think that The Matrix had great effects and a tighter story and I enjoyed the martial arts, the acting of Christian Bale, and surprisingly, the deeper sense of emotion and drama in Equilibrium.
