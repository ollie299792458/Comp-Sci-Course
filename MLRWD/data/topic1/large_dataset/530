Wearing a suit plastered with bumper stickers and emblems, this man engages many people in conversations about what Christianity and Christians mean to them. He talks with, and includes films of, people of opposing political viewpoints who still share common opinions of what the message of Jesus the Christ is and how we should live our lives if we really are His followers. Watching this softened my opinions about some people--particularly politicians and famous preachers--after hearing their heartfelt expressions of what they think Christianity means. There were, of course, many different opinions of the people interviewed on the street but almost everyone agreed that Christians often do not act as our Savior would in similar circumstances. Exchanges of people in a confessional at a street fair and a street ministry and the volunteers helping after Hurricane Katrina were poignant and thought-provoking and definitely pricked at my conscience because I can be too judgmental and don't do enough to help others. This has been a very interesting July 4th. It's cold and windy and rainy so we've been watching videos most of the day inside and all these documentaries and movies have give me a lot to think about. It has been a very interesting and enlightening time. I think this documentary would hit most people pretty hard and cause changes--worthwhile ones--in their lives.
