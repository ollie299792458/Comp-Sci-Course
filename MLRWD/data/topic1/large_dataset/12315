Faithful to the story, yes, but that's as much as we can say about this turgid and sterile drama. The whole thing comes across as annoyingly artificial: Cruise's laughably stodgy impersonation of a senior Wehrmacht officer, the mix of US/British accents, the immaculate sets filled with nazis in starched uniforms (hard to believe everyone and everything looked so spotless in 1944 Berlin). And Bryan Singer's directing is clumsy and uninspired, recycling the same visual cues over and over (do the test and look at this movie with the sound turned of; you'll notice how this whole narrative shrivels to a sequence of people picking up phones, opening envelopes and driving cars). I thought Carice Van Houten's commendable performance as von Stauffenberg's wife was the only, modest, highlight of the film. Not only is this an actress with a very striking appearance, she was the only character in the film that looked and acted believably "German". I'll watch out for her in other movies. The rest will soon be forgotten.
