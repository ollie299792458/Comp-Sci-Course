Yeah, BBC still know how to make a killer prehistoric animal documentary.  I found this show to be very interesting and for the most part very well researched.  The CGI effects are amazing, but at times you can still tell it's artificial.  Not enough to effect the rating, though.  The animals are awesome.  I loved the basilosaurus.  They also did a good job telling the story of our early ancestors.  My dad's a christian, and I almost luaghed ou loud at the look on his face when they went into detail about the man-apes.
I took a star off the rating for something that will probably only bother me.  The terror birds, a subject I happen to be very interested in, could have been done better.  The gastornis was alright except for it's lacking of arms, which is a fairly recent discovery, but the titanis birds near the end were very poorly portrayed.  The neck was far too long and the body too small.  Also, the birds are shown as pitiful scavengers being terrorized by the sabretooths.  Hahaha.  Don't hold your breath.  Again, these birds were lacking their arms.
But if you're like most people and don't know a terror bird from a tweety bird, then this show is the perfect documentary on ice-age animals and men.
