In reading some of the other reviews, it seems very much that this is a film that people either love or hate.  At first glance, it is very much the  boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy and girl date, boy and girl break up,  boy and girl get back together and the world is wonderful place kind of  story.  It's a teen flick so yes, it's going to be predictable.  Predictable, however, does not have to mean bad or boring.  There was a  great deal of emotional undertone to the story.  It's about college love,  which anyone who's been there knows isn't easy.  The timing always seems to  be wrong in one way or another.  Like many other films, this one does not  gloss over that part.  It very honestly, I think, shows the kinds of  problems that can evolve.  Granted, I don't have any porn star turned rich  lecturer friends, and I know no one who drank shampoo after a breakup, but  there is definitely some measure of reality and honesty to this picture.  Yes they end up together in the end (and no, that's not giving away the  ending) but it wasn't an easy road nor is there an implication that it is  going to be.  Love isn't easy.  It never has been.  If it were easy, the  feelings wouldn't have any meaning and this world would be a very dark  place.  This film captures that essence.  
If you're asking for a plot  that has twists and turns, something that is action packed, then don't see  this film.  It moves a little slowly and it is difficult to ascertain where  some of the characters are coming from.  But if you've been in love, if you  are in love, if you've had your heart broken or broken someone else's, even  if you want to fall in love, see this film.  It reminds all of us that  there is hope and that you can never completely give up on anybody.  One  day, you might just be surprised.
