Best Film Not Nominated:  Last of the Mohicans.  Michael Mann has captured a magnificent portrayal of life in the American writer James Fenimore Cooper's Central Leatherstocking Region, cast in Glens Falls in upstate New York.
Winner of the year's Academy Award for Best Sound, this masterpiece deserved recognition for camera work; the sets and camera work give the feeling that you're really there-- right in the middle of the pristine mountains and ferocious fighting.
Actually beautifully shot in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina,  locations used include the mountains of North Carolina Appalachia, Chimney Rock Park and The Biltmore Estate.
The music score by Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman, who replaced the former midway through production, yields an abrupt creative shift, proving greater than the sum of its parts.
Jones' opening main theme is grippingly effective music here, capturing the mystery and primal wonder of Cooper's frontier milieu in ravishing detail.
Dougie Maclean's  "The Gael" or  "The Kiss"  - Last of the Mohicans Theme - is replayed with tremendous effect.
The story is familiar, and illuminated by particularly exceptional performances by Madeleine Stowe and Wes Studi.
In short, there is more praiseworthy than space to tell it...  Outstanding in so many ways, and hauntingly beautiful.
