Jim Henson's The Dark Crystal is a visual muppet masterpiece.  Taking three years to make and going way over budget, the Dark Crystal hit theaters with mixed reviews.  As time moved on The Dark Crystal became a cult sleeper and is now loved by many people.  The story is the classic mythological journey story of growth and healing.  A gelfling, Jen, is one of the last of his kind to go out into the land of the dark crystal to find the shard that will heal the power source that tore its planet apart. Besides healing the crystal, Jen learns much about who he really is and the kind of people the gelfings use to be. The cruel Skeksis and gentle Mystics are beautifully crafted each in their own image to match their personality.  The pod people are an uplifting event admist the stress that is placed upon the main character.  The beauty of the planet, the wonder of the characters, and the story itself will take a person away for close to an hour and a half.
Aside from the movie, this DVD is special because it offers a completely instrumental track by composer Trevor Jones.  Since the soundtrack is no longer readily available, this little instrumental addition to the DVD allows the listener to feel the wonder of the film through the music alone.  Along with the documentary and deleted scenes, this DVD is worth every penny.  Jim Henson's crew spared no expense for the viewer to take the fantasy home.
