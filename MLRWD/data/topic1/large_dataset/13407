  The movie "Tape" Was truely one I will remember for a long time,and all for good reasons. What I thought made "Tape" intriguing and entertaining where the constant mood swings, plot twists, and change in atmosphere. "Tape" Always seemed to have a certain tension between the characters that even though sometimes not acknowledged was very relevant.
  In "Tape" I found myself engulfed in the story because you never truly know what the movie is about until the end.An interesting thing about "Tape" is that when the movie begins you are at the beggining of a tale but middle of a story, and when it ends it ends the tale but begins the story. "Tape" unlike some independant films knows where to begin and where to end, so are not disappointed.
  What helps keep "Tape" interesting and never boring is contributed mostly to the great plot, amazingly real acting and dialogue. "Tape is great in so many different ways and works on so many different levels. I highly recommend this movie. (...)
