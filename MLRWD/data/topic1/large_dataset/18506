Bunuel's films remain among the leading and truly subversive examples of 20th century cinema. And now that most movies are the product of rather large and shall we say committed to the mainstream entertainment corporations, any whiff of the subversive is typically squelched for, well, you tell me. So, we can only hope that someday soon more of his work -- perhaps even "The Exterminating Angel" -- will turn up on Criterion's list of newly restored masterpieces.

Assuming you already know the film (why else would you be looking here?) it's enough to say that Criterion has done their usual and detail-oriented job in bringing sound and image and translations up to the optimal. The extras are actually worth having and worth watching. Combined with the booklet essay and Bunuel interview, this work is set solidly and clearly into its historic and artistic context.

Of course, if you're not yet familiar "Viridiana" or the body of Bunuel's work, it's time to grow up and skip the distractions of various takes on da Vinci codes and risk some exposure to real ideas-- the kind that can change your way of thinking instead of simply reinforcing what you may already know.
