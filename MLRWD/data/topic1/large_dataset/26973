In the opinion of this Abbott and Costello fanatic, Volume 3 of Universal's superb ongoing Abbott and Costello festival is even better than Volume 2 (nothing can compare to Volume 1, when the boys were as fresh and alive as they would ever be on film). Included are the two finest films from the latter part of their career, the epochal "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" as well as the less well known but almost as good "A/C Meet the Invisible Man." Accompanying these high points are some supposed clunkers that are actually masterpieces of burlesque timing, like everything this team ever did. While not a great film, the sci-fi themed "Go to Mars" tickles the same part of the brain that enjoys 3-D Three Stooges shorts and anything created by Roger Corman before he discovered budgets with his Poe movies -- it's a stinker, but a truly campy and delicious one. And even the least of the films included here ("Mexican Hayride" would get my vote) offers a bright, bouncy and precious view into a lost world of comedy and slapstick.

Bottom line: At 8 films for 20 bucks, they're CHEAP. They're also GREAT. Own it TODAY.
