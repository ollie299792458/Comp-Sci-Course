I purchased this video a few months ago when I started my new exercise regimen (meaning, I haven't done any meaning physical activity since high school, which was quite a while ago).  I really, really like it.  It's great for beginners, and I would dare say intermediate exercisers as well.

The instructor is EXCELLENT in cueing, explaining the moves so you get them the first time, and it's very easy to just pop it in and go with it.  A lot of videos aren't, and this was VERY important for me because I get frustrated easily if the moves are too difficult, meaning I give up.  Which is why I haven't been exercising.  :o)

Pros:  the 10-minute format is great for those of you who lose steam not knowing how much time is left in the workout.  Also, the programmable format to mix and match the workouts you want is awesome.  I have three sections I like to do together for days when I just want an ab workout, and I feel I got a solid workout in.

Cons:  the 10-minute format. If you do JUST one segment, you're not going to see results quickly because you're not going to get the calorie burn.  But, I find I'll jog outside, then come in and do one of these 10-minute sections to hit my abs, and my daily workout is complete.

My favorite section is Six Pack Abs.  The others I usually do are Belly Fat Blaster and Flat Belly Fast.  The Abs Ripper seems too much for me right now, and I am not a pilates fan, so I haven't yet tried the Pilates Perfect Ab segment yet.

This is a great video for the price.  Buy it, you won't regret it.
