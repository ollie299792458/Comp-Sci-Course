Revealing and Scary

The recruit is an excellent movie that gives some very real insight into the world of national security and the inherent flaws in any intelligence agency that does not have sufficient controls, oversight, and transparency.  This movie is all too real in showing what actually has happened repeatedly in our intelligence agencies, where rogue agents are allowed to set up their own private operations that have nothing to do with national security and often betray our national security.

The compartmentalization used by such agencies has created a monster that is undermining our nation from within far faster than any foreign power can from without.

It also deals nicely with some of the primary tools of such agencies such as betrayal and psychological manipulation.  It reveals in great detail the slimy, sleazy, sorry underbelly of espionage.

I have seen this movie on cable before and they cut it up so much the movie loses its impact.  Watching it on DVD is much better.

This movie is a perfect example of why JFK had planned to dismantle the CIA and why Jimmy Carter severely reduced their numbers.  It is easy to pass this off as just another thriller or suspense movie, but if you pay attention this movie has a lot of very real and important information to reveal.

The acting is first rate as well.
