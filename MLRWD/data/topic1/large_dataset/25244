While I am personally disappointed at the amount of people that require bombs and crotch jokes to keep them entertained.  I have read every review to this point and I find that everyone that doesnt like the movie is upset that a story about real life drama is actually (wait for it) real.  The subtle storyline of a broken man whose only hope and solice is a friend that he can't even remember shakes the very foundation of what is considered to be normal.  We all wish for a great story were the guy gets the girl and everyone lives happily ever after.  The truth behind this movie is that it is honest to life and shows just that.  That not everyone is always happy and not every person goes through a horrible situation and comes out on the other side with a smile.

Adam Sandler does a terrific job of showing the subtle nature of just who a person can become.  To go from being a well respected dentist to being a closet hermite crab.  If you truely do not understand this, than please send 5 minutes and watch when Sandler finally explains his family.  The emotion, the pain and the thoughts.  While this scene is happening you think of how you would reply to such a travesty.  How you would cope with life.

Excluding the main storyline, this movie is still a great story.  A husband lost in life, scared to fully to commit to his wife of many years.  Even more terrified of show his actual weakness to anyone let alone himself.  So scared infact that he will not see a psychologist but, hides outside of one's office for a few minutes of conversation.

I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.  I am still not an Adam Sandler fan but, this movie shows me he can actually show emotion.
