This 1982 movie, My Favorite Year, directed by Richard Benjamin, is my all-time favorite Peter O'Toole film in which he is both amusing and heart-tugging. He creates, in the character of an aging, swashbuckling movie idol - now in an almost constantly inebriated state - a character who is totally charming and entertaining. Mark Linn-Baker,the rookie writer for the King Kaiser Comedy Cavalcade, and destined to be in charge of keeping O'Toole in line long enough to present properly on an early - and unbeknownst to O'Toole - live TV program, is a complete delight, as is Joseph Bologna who plays King Kaiser, the star of the TV production.

The casting for this movie is superb...Bill Macy, who portrays one of the writers for the King Kaiser Show, is about as good as it gets. And Laine Kazan, playing Linn-Baker's Brooklyn mother is a hoot and a half.

If you want to watch one movie that will make you laugh and lift your spirits, make it this one. You certainly won't regret it. Could easily become one of your favorite movies, too.
