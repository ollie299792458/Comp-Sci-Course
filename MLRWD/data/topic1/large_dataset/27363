I ordered two boxed sets - Season Four and Season Five. I am a great fan of Three's Company and would have ordered all the boxed sets; but unfortunately, the Gods of Fortune, Wealth, Luck and the like so prevalent in our culture, for some reason or other, always manages to sashay past me without so much as a 'Hi! This is yours.'

The service from AMAZON is real good. The Boxed Sets were delivered as promised. I am not a big purchaser of anything, so my experience of shopping - whether online or off the retail shops - is limited. But there was a time I ordered a book on IQ (wanted to see how to boost my brain power to better understand the thinking of the DEITIES) from Amazon. This book was supposed to ship through a third party, and, guess what, it never arrived.

I wrote to Amazon and they recredit the whole amount to my credit card.

I am going to get the other boxed sets in due course (one at a time of course), and will definitely purchased them through AMAZON.
