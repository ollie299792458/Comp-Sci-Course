This movie was fantastic. I had never seen X-Men before this, but after seeing the movie, I became hooked on the cartoon and comic, it has had such a profound impact on me. The actors they picked had astounding resemblences to Marvel's, and they catured the attitudes perfectly. After seeing it once, I went back to the cinema to see it again not 3 hours later, and found that it was as good then as it had been the previous time. X-Men is one of those movies that is good, no matter how many times you see it. Every time, you can pick up hidden jokes, mentions and cameos. The only thing that I now, after seeing the cartoon, find wrong with it, is that they melded together Beast and Jean Grey, and left out everyone's favourite Cajun, Gambit. However, I still give this movie 5 stars because it is just awesome. If you like sci-fi, you'll love this movie, regardless if you have been a Marvel fan for years, or not. And if this is the first time you see X-Men- well, I guarantee that from the moment it ends onward, you will be a devoted fan.
