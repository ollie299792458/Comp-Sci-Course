William Powell is down on his luck. A "forgotten man" in the '30s, what we'd call a homeless man today.

He then has the good luck and bad fortune to be rescued, in a zany scavenger hunt, by the even zanier family of the truly zany Carole Lombard. 
From forgotten man to manservant to man about town, all in 90 unforgettably funny -- and touching -- minutes.

William Powell has never been more charming, and Carole Lombard has never been so desirable. In addition to the lively script and great acting, wait until you see the Art Deco sets. Pure eye candy, even in black &amp; white. 
And about that black &amp; white picture -- Criterion must have spent a small fortune restoring this movie. The picture looks better than it has in two generations. This is as fine a print as any moviegoer saw when the film was first released. My old cheapie DVD copy was so washed out that some scenes were almost unwatchable. The sound is plain old mono, but it's much more crisp than before, and totally lacking in all the scratch and hiss. 
A perfect movie, perfectly reproduced.
