I just got finished watching Conquest of Space while eating my one meal of the day.  I've got to tell you, it brought back old memories of the fifties and sixties movies where you have a lot of soldiers and no women.

It is a fun movie.  There is no doubt who the bad guys are and who the good guys are--there were no bad guys.  No, there are no aliens or anything like what we usually see now adays--nary a one.  Instead this movie takes a shot at space exploration in the same vein as the Robert A. Heinlein did in his earlier works, hard science (at least for the day).

The acting is there, I found really no short comings.  An attempt at special effects was made using some logic and physics, and the idea of the movie (going to mars) was/is a great idea.

I think Heinlein would have busted a gut at the inaccuracies in the movie but I'm sure he would have liked it.  I feel he would have given it a three star rating and maybe one more star for the acting.  So I give it five because I'm not as sharp as Heinlein and am a little more easily swayed.

Finally, I feel all of you who watch and collect these older science fiction movies will have to get this one--so few of our science fiction movies were done with a serious outlook--those of you who have to have naked women and exploding heads in a movie need not apply.

So, to the cast and crew, writer/director of this movie...and all movies like it, and Robert A. Heinlein-for all you did, for all you do-this Buds for you.
