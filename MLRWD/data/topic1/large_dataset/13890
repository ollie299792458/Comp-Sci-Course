Being intrigued by the serial killer genre I have seen this movie thrown around numerous times by Amazon. I decided to rent it and I was blown away. I won't go into extreme detail because it's not my place to spoil this movie for you. This movie is not based on a true story and it is a low budget flick...
This movie begins and ends with the suberb acting of Michael Rooker, the main character "Henry"... he does an absolute amazing job of depicting the heartlessness of many of these killers. Everything you hear associated with a killer is touched in this film. With most killers you'll hear about no sense of remorse for their victims and that is exactly the personality of the main character. One quote that I won't forget is towards the end when Henry says, "I guess I love you too," in reply to Otis' sisters "I love you Henry." 
I won't spoil anymore. If you have any doubts on picking this movie up,don't it is worth it. Do youself a favor and watch it. As always it's not for everyone and some may be offended and disgusted by some of the content but overall it is very clean w/out gore which I appreciated.
