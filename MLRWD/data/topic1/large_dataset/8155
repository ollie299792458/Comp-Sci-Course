I am happy with my purchase. Each workout is roughly 30 minutes each. They are broken down into a warm up, two different routinues using upper and lower body together with cardio, and a cool down/stretch. The cardio is a lot of jumping (think jumping jacks, etc.) What I really like about the workouts is that they are time efficient. I feel like I got a workout in 30 minutes and she combines upper and lower boday together. Maybe I'm crazy but I am starting to see a difference after 7 workouts. If you liked Jillian on the Biggest Loser, you'll like her on the DVDs. Her personality is the same.

Why I gave the DVDs 4: There are no demos of the exercises, so if you are not familiar with the exercises in her book (Winning By Losing) you might want to watch the DVDs before you do them or to see what the modified version of the exercise is. I believe she mentions that in the intro as well. Also, there a lot of jumping. I read in another person's review that that can be bad for joint problems, so something to consider.

Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. I would recommend this to a friend and I will probably buy it as a gift for someone in the future.
