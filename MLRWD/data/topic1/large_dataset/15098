The reason I am giving this DVD 3 stars is not because the movie is bad, but because the DVD version is bad.  I loved the movie itself and for the most part agree with the positive reviews that have been posted here.  I have been a Jet Li fan, as well as a martial arts movie fan in general, for many years and this is by far one of Jet Li's finest films.  Unfortunately, this DVD version suffers from terrible subtitling and a lack of extras for the price.  There are no theatrical trailers, only one deleted scene out of many which have been written about throughout the internet, and no running commentary.  But the biggest problem I had, as mentioned earlier, was the subtitling.  I had watched the Chinese released DVD before the theatrical release and then watched it in the theatre.  There were some differences between these two versions in regards to the translation of the Mandarin and Japanese being spoken, but for the most part were the same.  However, the translation for the US released DVD is totally different in some parts and to me ruined some of the more important dialogue.  One example is when Huo Yinjia is explaining his philosophy on martial arts to his soon-to-be opponent Tanaka.  Also, since I understand just a tad bit of Japanese I knew that some of the translations on this DVD were way off the mark and ruined the overall feeling of those scenes. This was not the case of the Chinese released DVD and the US theatrical release.  Again, I'd like to make it very clear that the movie itself was awesome and would rate 5 stars in book.  The 3 star rating is for the US released DVD.  Whether you saw the movie in the theatre or want to watch it for the first time, I'd stay clear of this version and go to your local Chinatown or Ebay and purchase the Chinese version of the DVD.  How or why they did such a poor job on the translation compared to the US theatrical release and the Chinese DVD is a mystery to me.
