I am an unabashed 'Versus' fanatic for the last 10 years and will show it to anyone who has never seen the film. It's campy, over-the-top, Japanese Horror-Action goofiness at its finest and I love it for it.

I have owned 3 different versions of this film: the nearly bare-bones R-Rated DVD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009EIRW">Versus</a>, the amazing "Ultimate" 3-disc version with tons of extras and the added action scenes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JBXP5W">Ultimate Versus</a> and this new Blu-Ray release. As such, I can only recommend this to fans of the film looking for the best audio quality of all the releases.

I note the audio because the video transfer leaves much to be desired. It is a transfer of the R-Rated version with the color enhancements present from the "Ultimate" version but with the added action bits left out. However, film grain and heavy print damage is hugely apparent even though certain details are definitely enhanced. I can certainly chalk this up to the low budget of the original production but it certainly could have been handled better. For this, HD fanatics will definitely be disappointed with the picture. Fans of the film can pick between watching the Blu-Ray or watching the "Ultimate" DVD on an upconverting player and still enjoy it.

Audio-wise, there is no comparison: The Blu-Ray boasts DTS Master 5.1 Audio that offers the best sound of any version of the film and is fantastic to hear. Otherwise, the extras are all SD and have existed from previous versions of the film.

If you are looking to get Versus in any form and don't care about the HD or DTS audio, go with the "Ultimate" version <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JBXP5W">Ultimate Versus</a>. If you already have the "Ultimate" Version, grab this to have an HD version of the R-Rated cut to complete your collection of this great film.
