Goood movie. It got trashed by most reviewers, but aside from the completely made up parts, it was a pretty cool portrayal of the real events. Gitsie and michael were NEVER lovers. Michael was completely gay. Also you get the feeling they crammed 10 years into a few months. Christina was long dead by the time angel came into the scene. There also were the obvious club kids missing. Lahoma and Jennytalia were both interviewed in the documentary and Jennytalia in particular was a huge part of the book, yet both are mysteriously absent from the film. Seth Green had James's mannerisms down pat and in particular, his laugh. He does an incredible job of playing James. Wilmer Valderrama is drop dead gorgeous. I wish we could have seen "more" of him, LoL. Culkin brought a human side to Michael never seen before, although you still get the feeling it's Macaulay Culkin playing Michael Alig. The addition of real club kids like Amanda Lepore and Richie Rich added authenticity to the film, although I wish they would have gotten at least a few lines. Overall, I recommend reading the book or seeing the shockumentary first, as they are more accurate depictions of the story, although I still highly recommend the movie. Also to "get into it", you would probably need to be a girly girl or a gay guy as I am.
