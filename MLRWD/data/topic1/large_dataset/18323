First off I definitely don't view Gordon Gecko (GG) as either a sinner or a saint.  In my mind there is considerable merit in much of the wisdom that GG espouses.  One of my favorite lines from the film has to be when Buddy (Charlie Sheen) asks GG 'What about hard work?'  Gecko's response is right on the money and histerical at the same time.  Gecko's ethics may be lacking but his sense of what is truly reality in our society is absolutely correct and should be pondered and learned from.
And then you have the contrast of Martin Sheen's character who is just your average typical hard working blue collar guy (commendable).  But he like so many others like him is at the mercy of the true powers that be.  THERE IS A HAPPY MEDIUM BETWEEN THE TWO. Each has its own merits. That is what I personally strive for.
Charlie Sheen is fabulous.  He displays so much honesty in every scene whether it's snorting coke with a hooker, schmoozing secretaries to gain entrance, or utter deflation as he is being arrested.  Michael Douglas gives one of my favorite performances ever.
It's a real thrill to see the hope and naive exuberance of youth be contrasted with stark reality of truth.
One of my top 10 favorite films of all time.
