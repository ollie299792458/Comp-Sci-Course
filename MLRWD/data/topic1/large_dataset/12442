I went into this movie with very high expectations, because I am a huge Pixar fan.  From the trailers, it appeared to be about Merida and possibly other clan members, on the hunt to slay an evil beast and save their people.  The movie started out great, with the competition, a lot of laughs, introducing the characters, and an all around great time.  Still, I was waiting for those glorious bow and arrow scenes that the trailers and posters had constantly teased.  I was waiting for Merida to ride around on her horse and go into battle.  Essentially, due to the trailers, I was expecting a Mulan sort of movie.

When we get to the part of the movie where Merida meets the witch and things start ramping up, I was thinking, "oh great this is going to get really fun."  Still, I saw no sign of that happening.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the mother and daughter scenes and thought they were touching.  Once the mother was a bear, it was endearing, cute, and playful to watch the bear and Merida together.

Then, suddenly the movie seemed to end, and still there was no battle, no rush of adrenaline on the scale that I had expected, and nothing to make me cheer out loud for the protagonists.  Basically, I didn't have the fun rush of previous Pixar movies that I had come to expect.  Having said that, I still give the movie 4 out of 5 stars, because it looked gorgeous, the voice acting was top notch, and the story did touch my heart.

To sum it all up, if you watch Brave for combat, whether it's single person or on a grander scale, it won't live up to what you are expecting.  However if you go into it with the mindset that it's going to be a princess fairy tale and a bonding movie, you will relate to it and love it.
