Personally, as a fan of the show, I thought this live adaptation was right on the mark.

The filmmakers found a good story that helps MAKE the live transition. The action sequences are orignal and nice to look at. But I think what makes this film pretty decent is the story and the question it poses about human cloning. What happens when it's all there is left? Do you do it to save humanity? Or follow the ambiguous moral ethics that seem to want to frown on the mere IDEA of cloning humans? With the scenario and the cloning question in place, it didn't make the movie unbelievable in any way.

I think people just put too much expectation in an MTV movie and decided it was going to be bad before even seeing it. And by doing that actually BELIEVED it was bad while they were watching it. You want pure unadulterated cheesey badness...see "Ultraviolet". But this one was pretty good. Not exactly "The Fifth Element", but not a bad effort. Just give a chance, and you'll probably enjoy it.
