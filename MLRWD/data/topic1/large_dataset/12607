The first comic book I ever bought was X-Men #130, way back when I was 12.  I collected every issue as they came out up to about #300, and hunted down and bought issues back to #100.  I was an X-Freak.  Then I went to college and kind of forgot about them.  
X2 thrilled me to the core.  Even if it doesn't follow the comic books exactly (shouldn't Iceman be much older than Rogue?  Why doesn't she have Ms. Marvel's powers?  Why isn't Pyro British?) and even if I can't identify some of the younger mutants (I recognized Syren and Kitty Pryde, but who the hell is the kid with the blue tongue?  And who is this Gambit that everyone mentions here?  Was he even in the film?) it was stunning to see the action unfolding on screen.  The opening Nightcrawler attack sequence was amazing.  Magneto's escape sequence was awesome to behold.
I do have a few quibbles - Cyclops could have been used more effectively, for example.  He could have even not been in the film and it wouldn't have changed too much.  I wanted to see a lot more of Colossus.  The Wolverine/Deathstrike battle was over far too quick.  Two hours felt too short and rushed.  And would that much extra iron in your blood just kill you or shut down your liver or something?  Ah.. comic book logic.  
But the end... my skin was tingling and I got goosebumps (never - NEVER - have I gotten goosebumps at a movie before!) when I it gradually sank in exactly what they were setting up for X3. (HINT - look at the issue number I started my collection at, and add about, oh, seven.)  
I have no idea HOW they'll do that in two hours though.  All I know is I can't wait.
