White Christmas has been one of my favorite movies since I was a wee tyke, and after wearing out three copies on VHS, I realized that it was time to take the plunge and purchase it on dvd. It arrived in a timely manner and was well-wrapped for safe delivery. The dvd case was in pristine shape, and the dvd itself had no flaws whatsoever.

This movie is, in my opinion, THE best Christmas movie out there. It stands among the ranks of Miracle on 34th Street and It's a Wonderful Life, and has a sense of nostalgia that simply cannot be found in movies nowadays. The vocal performances by Crosby and Clooney are unparalleled, and Danny Kaye and Vera Ellen's dance performances take the film to a whole other level. The cast is extremely talented, and film production is very well done -- especially for the time.

Since receiving the film three weeks ago, I have watched it four times already and have fallen in love with the film all over again every time I have watched it. This film is comparable to none other, and is the perfect stocking stuffer or Christmas gift for anyone who wishes for the old days when Christmas was more about the simple things.

I personally would recommend this film to anyone. Lovely story, lovely production, and the film itself is all-around the best.
