a reviewer below me called the storyline to this movie "a jumbled mess". oh my, how wrong he is. although, i will admit... i did not fully understand the storyline to this movie for TEN years. that doesn't mean it was a jumbled mess, though. it only means that my feeble mind wasn't able to comprehend the depth, detail and layers to it at first. so, TEN years later (2006) i watched it for what was probably the 20th odd time, and i FINALLY understood all of the twists and turns in the storyline and it all came together so beautifully. it was like poetry. it was one of those moments where you sit back and say to yourself "how in the hell can someone write something so ingenious?". so anyways, my point is: this movie has depth. it has layers upon layers upon layers. this is nothing like MI2 or MI3. this is a thinking-mans movie, and it is aesthetically beautiful in a very artistic way. each time you watch it, a new part of the story will reveal itself for you. and that's why i think this is the best M:I movie in the series BY FAR. compared to this one, the other two subsuquent sequals are loud, unintelligent and highly forgettable. like another reviewer said before me... this is one of the best action films i have ever seen. get it.
