honestly, i haven't seen this movie in about two weeks. I got it first  about a month ago, and watched it again and again. I think i have seen it  four times. It is extremely hard for me not to pick it up in the rental  store. I am forcing myself to not watch it so i don't get tired of it. I  sure as hell do not want to memorize it. ok, now to the movie. It is great.  I'd like to think i watch a fair amount of movies, about 1-3 every week.  This is my absolute favorite movie. One thing i can remember about why i  like it is that there are a lot of scenes where something could happen and  it, doesn't! it is quite difficult to understand, but to see something that  has scenes like that is great. to explain, most movies i see use every  scene to try and make something happen, and the characters are flawless,  they always say the right thing at the right time. This movie does not do  that. it is life-like. it gets the viewer to root for the characters, like,  do this, do that, why aren't you doing that, and so on. and when the  characters don't do what you were hoping, you honestly feel let down. in a  good way. i don't know if this makes any sense, but i love this movie  greatly. It is Scorsese's masterpiece, in my mind.
