Chobits was cool. It has good animation and sound. The characters were all pretty good too.

I disliked this series only because I can't get into a romance between a computer and a human being. I'm the type of guy who would have liked to have seen social prejudice against persecoms. Some of the main characters disliked them but only because they got jilted because of them. I would have liked Chi to have acquired a personality by the end but she continued to talk in third-person and had no desires other than to be with Hideki. During the show I kept thinking to myself that it would be great if he got with a human instead of a robot. I couldn't get into the idea of his trading real girls in for a computer. During the series they tried to make it more ambiguous on being in love with a computer so you can get used to the idea but I just didn't buy it.

I give this two stars because I wanted more out of it. I will give it credit though. I liked the characters but the main relationship was something I couldn't get past. This show is very cute throughout and it had great humour. Show's like this don't need to be very deep if you aren't picky in a love story then this is for you.

My suggestion would be to skip this and go to something like Ah! My Goddess. It is heart warming and love between two sentient biological people (although they are of different species).
