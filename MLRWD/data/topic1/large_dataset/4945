This us a fun movie to watch when you are alone and can acclimate yourself to a simpliar time in movie making. Loguns run has, for many sci-fi fans many infectious elements. Such as the audio sound in the background. The idea of all wearing the same clothes. If you liked "The Island" this is definitely its predecessor. Overall, this movie needs to be watched by people who like that quiet slow pace to a movie in any genre. "The World, The Flesh and the Devil", "Last man on earth", "The omega man", "Mad Max", "Rollerball"," Zardoz " and "Dawn of the Dead". Like "Star Wars IV", the characters are silly but likeable. Many of today's movies are outstanding on special effects, but the characters are sometimes more polished, but not endearing. The useage of extreme colors in set design and wardrobe. Again, if you did not grow up with these movies, you might not like Loguns Run unless you are a younger movies buff that likes to explore older movies and see their merit in what they were trying o convey. Some reviewers that saw this as a child and bought it are wondering why they ever liked this movie. Remember, we have all grown smarter and progressed. It takes more and more to entertain us. But, if you can sit back by yourself and not get distracted on a rainy day or late at night, you might start to look to buy more and more of these types of movies.When TMC does Oscar month and I start to watch old b/w movies I notice the overacting, the lack of pace etc. But, soon I am looking at the guide to see what other movies I have heard of that I never saw or the ones I have not seen since I was a kid. Give these types of movies their time.
