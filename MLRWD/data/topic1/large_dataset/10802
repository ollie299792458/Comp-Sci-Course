As a Mini owner-the identical twin of Charley's in this film-and as a fan of the original Italian Job, I felt an obligation to go and see this film.  I must admit I went expecting to be let down.  I mean, no one makes action movies like they used to, right?  WRONG!!!  I was delighted to find that this is a real, old-school, action-upon-more-action film.  From the first chase sequence through the cramped canals of Venice, you get the impression that you're in for a very exciting ride.  And it only gets better!  Not only are the chase scenes elaborate and perfectly choreographed, but the plot is clear and straight forward.  No useless side plot/love story thrown in for the ladies....Thankfully!!!  The cast was great too.  Everyone was perfect for their role.  Mark Whalburgh is perfect as the likeable thief, Charley.  Donald Southerland is great as the aging robber and mentor to Charley, although I think this would have been a perfect role for Michael Caine.  Edward Norton is the slimiest slime ball ever!!!!  Seth Green is hilarious as always.  And Jason Statham, well I've had a crush on him since Lock Stock!!!  But the real stars are the three Mini Coopers.  They race around through packed streets, on sidewalks, and through subway tunnels.  They take sharp turns, flights of stairs, and the highest jumps like they were nothing.  I saw the original Italian Job when I was 10 and it made me want a Mini, this film made me proud that I own one!!!A top film all round and worth going to see....several times!!!!!
