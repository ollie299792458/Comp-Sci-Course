All our favorite toys are back, facing peril again. Andy, their owner, is going to college. Now what's to become of his beloved toys? The answer to that is the usual grand adventure, with pitfalls and peril that seems so real it will keep you on the edge of your seat, I was! Sad to report, the 3rd Toy Story falls a little short of the trilogy's overall magic. Returning to the somewhat "dark" overtones of the original Toy Story, I found it a little scary for the very young, as I felt about the original. Toy Story 2 was better than the original, and for me, that still holds true. This time, the trash and the day care center are seen from the toys' viewpoint and is not as nice as it might sound. Through the machinations of a bitter teddy bear, they nearly get burnt up at the dump! Of course, Woody and Buzz wind up victorious by working together, and all their friends use their special talents to make it come out all right. There is a delightful scene near the end showing the magic of children's imagination  as they play with their toys. I truly enjoyed watching <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZMUTZ4">Toy Story 3</a> and will again and again.
