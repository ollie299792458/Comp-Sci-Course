This is one of my all-time favorite films, and my favorite Truffaut film--it was also reportedly Truffaut's favorite of his own works.  Visually, it has a kind sepia-toned haze of one's remembrances of a lazy afternoon, or one's best childhood summer.  The costumes, the bike rides, the delightful characters the protagonists (Jules, Jim & Catherine) encounter are a model for the bohemian life that many still aspire to--enjoying great food, drink, art and theater, and of course a very free attitude toward love/sex/romance. The film depicts what happens when the fun goes too far and becomes obsession.

The story is about obsession, two men's obsession with a woman who, in a very French style approach to femininity, does what she wants with whomever she wants to, when she wants to.  It's a great story because the men don't know exactly why they can't let go of Catherine (the female object of their desire), but she seems totally assured and deems herself worthy of their subservience.  When they pull away, she fights hard to reel them back in--to the point of risking everything.

It's really a delight visually and an intriguing and unusual take on how a woman's 'mystique' can hold a man in thrall.  Don't see it if you're a misogynist or feel uncomfortable with the idea of a woman being the object of a man's desire.  Also has a lot of interesting filming devices that were ahead of their time (Truffaut's genius)...those scenes will stick in your mind and haunt your dreams.  A must-have for the library of any true film-lover.
