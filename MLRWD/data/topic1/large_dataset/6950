Must Love Dogs finds two recently divorced people (Sarah Nolan (Diane Lane), Jake Anderson (John Cusack)) being urged by friends and family to get in there and date. Mostly the story is about Sarah. Her sister puts her profile up on an Internet dating site and she meets a lot of men who just aren't her type to put it mildly. Then she meets Jake.  The first date is a bit tense as he insults her while trying to get to know her. The second doesn't go much better, and then she meets the father of one of her pupils.

Jake and Sarah just can't seem to click even though they like each other. There are misunderstandings, embarrassing situations, and lots of moments that most of us have endured in the dating game. And of course a happy ending.

Formulaic maybe. Fun -- definitely. Not high drama but well worth the time to watch and filled with those embarrassing moments that make you wince and yell at the tube "Don't go there", "No", and "Go for it."

If you're a sucker for happy endings for good people, and enjoy seeing family members who care about each other, then this is just a nice feel good movie. Enjoy it for what it is.
