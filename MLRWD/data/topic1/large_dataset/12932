An excellent finale to Hammer's original Dracula series, in which the Count finally invades England a la the Stoker original. (All of the previous films - Horror of Dracula, The Brides of Dracula, Dracula: Prince of Darkness, and Dracula Has Risen from the Grave - had been set in Transylvania, and other less specific European locales.)  Not by any means a literal translation of Stoker, this film is true to the spirit of the novel in that Dracula reflects the fears, insecurities, and deep-rooted hypocrisies of the society he seeks to infiltrate.  The film is painstakingly faithful to the series, even replaying the conclusion of its predecessor in setting up the action.  The script seems to owe a debt to Hammer's Frankenstein Created Woman, with the monster being "created" out of the vicious deeds of three unwise men.  The atmosphere of the film is dark and sinister, and Christopher Lee is in top form as the Count, backed by a solid supporting cast.  Peter Sasdy's direction is top-notch.  It is unfortunate that, other than here and Hammer's Countess Dracula, the director never really fulfilled his early promise.  The DVD contains, for the first time in North America, the complete and uncut version of the film, which makes it a must-see for all Hammer and/or horror fans. Recommended!
