I'm very familiar with Leslie's other WATP videos and own many of them.  This is my new favorite!

I love that this one doesn't use any weights or other props because I can take it out of town with me and easily watch it on my laptop and exercise in a hotel room or when visiting relatives.

I love that Leslie and all of the participants are super upbeat throughout.  Her encouraging words are definitely what a person wants to hear when exercising.

The music is great.  I don't know what other posters are complaining about.  It's varied and appropriate.  Besides, after you've done Leslie's workout several times, you can turn down the sound and play a CD of your favorite dance tunes instead.  All exercise music gets boring after hearing it over and over.

I would recommend rotating this one with Leslie's other workouts that include the weights or any other workout that uses weights for toning.  Variety is the spice of life and choosing to do the very same workout every day is a recipe for disaster.  Rotate!  This one would be a great one to do twice per week and do a different one once or twice a week.
