I love this movie, but the quality didn't look too great when  played on our DVD player. It looked a bit hazy and the colors weren't vivid. We recently purchased an upconverting, Blu Ray player. I was pleased that the the DVD looked much nicer when we used our new player.  But, beware, if you're playing this on a DVD player that doesn't have the upconverting feature, you might be disappointed with the quality of the picture.

I've only watched the movie and haven't taken time to play any games or do any of the activities. If I do, I'll update my review.

The snow globe is very cute. It's approx. 4 1/4" wide x 4" high. The glass globe is a little bigger than a tennis ball.

5 stars for the great movie; 3 stars for the quality; 4 stars overall
