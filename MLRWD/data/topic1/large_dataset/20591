First and foremost, the best thing about this movie...Melvin Udall.  Not Jack Nicholson, but Melvin Udall, the main character.  Nicholson is brilliant, and his performance in this movie was no different, but the  character of Melvin is pure genius and is clearly the biggest reason for  the success of this movie.  He has some of the best one-liners I've ever  heard, but his character also has incredible depth, and can be analyzed  over and over again.  Very well-rounded, and just so I don't take anything  away from Nicholson...very well-acted.
Some liked Helen Hunt in this  movie, some apparently didn't.  I thought she did a great job.  In As Good  As It Gets, she masters the actor's art of making it seem like she wasn't  acting at all.  I have no objection at all for the fact that she won the  Oscar; I found it well-deserved.
Greg Kinnear rounds out the "big  3" by putting in a great performance as well.  Playing the gay  neighbor of the main character isn't exactly an easy role to pull off; add  to that the fact that he also has to undergo a subtle character  transformation during this movie, and I think Kinnear deserves a lot of  credit.
If there is one knock on this movie that I agree with, it's the  complaint that the romance isn't believable.  Melvin is an extremely  likeable character, but as you will discover if you haven't seen this movie  yet, most of his humor stems from his crass and tactless nature...aside  from a couple of nice romantic lines, I personally was left scratching my  head as to how Carol (Helen Hunt) could fall in love with this  man.
Still, the positives of this movie far outweigh the negatives...it  is hilarious as a comedy, and touching and thought-provoking as a drama.  If you haven't seen it yet, see it immediately...if you have seen it and  liked it, don't hesitate to buy it.  Upon repeat viewings, it doesn't grow  stale; this movie contains too many facets and subtleties to ever reach  that level, in my view.
