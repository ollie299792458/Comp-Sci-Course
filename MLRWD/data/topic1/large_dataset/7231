Forget the comparisons with Strangelove and Wag the Dog. Those are both classics in their own right, but "In the Loop" is different. The closest comparison I can give this is "Yes Minister", but far more subversive. This is razor-sharp.

The point of the film is political career as well as the way political power works. When is a politician willing to sacrifice career for principle, and what happens to principled politicians when faced with trans-Atlantic geopolitics? When does one choose expediency over principle? The prospect is bleak.

In this case both British and Americans are put to the test in the face of an impending war in the Middle-East - pushed by a cynical American appointee who keeps a live hand grenade as a paper-weight. It's not a spoiler that the Anglo-American alliance does go to war. That's pretty much assumed from the beginning.

What is fascinating is how this horrific combination of appeasement and war-mongering can be turned into comedy. One could have played this any number of ways. But comedy? ... As in LOL comedy ?  Not a kind of PBS/NPR occasional chuckle, but actual' laughs?

This film succeeds wonderfully.  It is an incredibly funny and acerbic portrayal of power.

One word on the dialogue: across the pond, profanities can approach sheer poetry. "In the Loop" is a wonderful exploration of that capability. If this is a concern for you then there is a delightful scene in the film that addresses the issue. Watch for it.
