After watching this movie and drawing my own conclusions,I give it two stars. I did not buy it,...rented it instead. Anyway,I came to the conclusion that it lacked a plot,...that was problem no.1. Problem no.2,
Bernie Mac as Bosley was downright horrible. Problem no.3,Kelly(Jaclyn
Smith)was not given a big enough role in this movie. Her appearance in
the film was all too brief to say the least. I would have loved to have seen Kelly go after Angel-gone-bad Demi Moore and show her a few things about respect for the boss,...Charlie,of course! Drew,Cameron,and Luci
were okay,...but they lacked the professionalism that the original Angels
had. This movie would have been better if Kelly would have had a much bigger role in the film. In fact,she could have ran the office in place of Bosley in this film,...perhaps better. Still,the film was okay to say the least. It could have used a bit more of a story line,and still have the humor. Since Kelly(Jaclyn Smith)was not given a much bigger role in this flm,I will not be buying it!
