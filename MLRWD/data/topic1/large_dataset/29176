Gulliver's travels could have been a good movie. But, unfortunately they cast Jack Black to play Gulliver. He is vulgar, inane, childish - but not in a good way. And, of course, he can't act to save his life. He must be related to someone important in Hollywood because there is no other sane reason for him to be cast in any film other than something that makes Dumb and Dumberer look smart and smarterer.

Even if you get this movie for free, don't waste your time watching it, unless you're stranded on an island with only two movies and the other one is a different Jack Black film.

I feel sorry for the other actors in the movie. For the rest of their lives they're saddled with this moron of a lead actor in the film that gave them the opportunity to shine.

Casting was done by Priscilla John and Jeanne McCarthy - I will avoid any movie with their names in the credits. And, director Rob Letterman should be just as ashamed for taking on this job. Black is listed as one of the producers, probably the only way he can get into films these days.

AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!!!
