One customer review gave this DVD a mere four stars, calling it "visually abbreviated" because it isn't in widescreen.
There was no such thing as widescreen prior to 1953. ALL films made before then were filmed with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 (aka 4:3), the same as television. In fact, the size of your television screen was taken from the standard format defined by Hollywood.
In 1953, "The Robe" became the first picture released in Cinemascope. This is considered the birth of widescreen. "The Robe" was a huge popular success. (It is true that there were some widescreen films prior to "The Robe," but the number of these films was extremely small and required theatres to use special equipment.)

This DVD of "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" is not "visually abbreviated" in any way. There is nothing to abbreviate. 
So don't go looking for widescreen versions of "Citizen Kane" or "The Wizard of Oz."
