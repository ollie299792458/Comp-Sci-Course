i'd like to start off by saying this isn't exactly a sequel, obviously judy garland isnt in it, and obviously this time around its a lil 9yo girl instead of a 16yo girl. But the story is still great, even though this movie got extremely mixed reviews. i'm on the side that fell liking it. From what i've read, this movie falls a lot darker then the first movie. Its more in tune to the original books, than its first movie counterpart. but it still has that great magical feeling to it. i honestly suggest people purchase this dvd, its worth the buy.
the ruby slippers from movie one, do make a come back. and i thought i saw glinda the good witch of the north in one scene but that was explained to be...
anyway as for the features in this dvd, its also dubbed in french, like thats a real popular language here ugh, spanish would of been preferred. there is an interview with the actress who played dorothy that was made in 2002 i believe. this dvd also includes the original theatrical trailer, and a few tv spots. this movie runs a total 1hour 40minutes.
and if you didnt already know, this movie isnt really for kids, its for teenagers and adults or even people who've seen the original wizard of oz as kids and who are now adults. give this movie a try, i'm sure you'll enjoy it all.
