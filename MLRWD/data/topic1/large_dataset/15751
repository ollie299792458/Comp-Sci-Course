What can I say? For a brief period of time though exiled from the USA Orson Welles made some of his finest films including outstanding work by actors and crew who obviously cared.

Though I often have something to dissect within the films I review, here I'll just offer bullet-points regarding some things I love about "The Trial" and the Milestone copy in specifically:

1) The picture and sound are great and the folks at Milestone are very sweet.

2)This is Welles' best 'villain' role, surpassing even his over-the-top drunk cop in "Touch Of Evil". His role as the 'Advocate' is performed seductively and even vaguely humorously, and when he spells out (through a allegoric story) the hideous truth behind 'K's indictment it is one of film history's most chilling moments.

3) Akim Tamiroff never disappoints in Welles' films and next to his role as the aging crook in "Mr.Arkadin" this may be his best.

4)The sets and lighting are astonishing and grandly baroque. You'll just have to see it. 'Nuff said.

5)Tony Perkins is outstanding as 'K'. I don't know about the book, but the film requires his character be slightly affected, boyish, indignant, impatient and outraged. He is all these things and more, including the slight nebbish quality that so many 'guilty' men acquire. Whether speaking quietly to his cousin or close to a nervous breakdown in front of the 'condemned' he is at all times believable and sincere in his portrayal.

That being said, the film is a little expensive for the casual viewer, but oh! so worth it. The film feels like a downward spiral, great rainy-day or midnight fare when you have no other distractions. Daylight and the phone ringing will kill the mood.

If you are like me, you will go into "The Trial" already having been a fan of at least a couple of other Welles' films, Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, "Eraserhead", and late 1950's Euro cinema and you will not find yourself disappointed.
