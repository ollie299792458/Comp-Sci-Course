In response to the reviewer who claims that Stoker is the only one who should write Dracula and yet praises Coppola's version: Make up your mind. Coppola's Dracula aint Stoker's Dracula. Coppola made major changes. Those who think that only Stoker should write Dracula should stick to the book. Some of us like to watch films AND read. I enjoyed Dracula 2000. It dealt with not only Stoker's work but with the entire Dracula legend that it spawned. Stoker never really told us who Dracula was. His Dracula says he's of the same blood as the warrior Dracula. Is he? Is he Vlad Tepes? Is he something older than Vlad? The mystery provides plenty of room for entertaining speculation. As the years pass the legend of Dracula and the mystery of his origin continues and grows. Dracula 2000 gives us a clever take on who the infamous vampire is and how he became that way. It fits in well with Dracula's modern status as one of the most legendary dark characters in fiction. Dracula 2000 is devilishly entertaining.
