I am a big fan of Will Ferrel. He is a very talented actor and is also very funny. Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson are also very talented actors. So you know the movie has talent, but does it have depth, well, not really. Does this movie have laughs, Oh yes! This is an enjoyable movie with very many laughs, an enjoyable cast, and a FUN story. Also, Juliette Lewis is a very good actress, and we are graced with a brief moment of Sean William Scott. I laughed the whole time Scott was on the screen.
Will Ferrel displays his best talent by just letting us watch him and laugh, no holding back. Wilson is the main character, and most responsible. Vaughn gives a whole different way to make us laugh, he's definately an original. The only thing that lacks in this movie is a sense of together-ness(is that a word?). Its basically fun for the sake of fun, and stupidity for the sake of stupidity, but none-the-less, it is absolutely hilarious and eye watering funny. So I would definately say, if you are in the mood for a comedy, and have a few extra bucks to spare, make an investment in Old School, you are sure to get your moneys worth.
RATED R FOR SOME STRONG SEXUALITY, SOME NUDITY, AND LANGUAGE.
