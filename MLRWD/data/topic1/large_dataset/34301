I bought this movie on a whim.  Like many people of late I have become something of a Peter Jackson fan, and the only pre-Lord of the Rings movie of his I had seen before this was "Heavenly Creatures." (Also a great movie). I am very pleased with my purchase, to say the least!  Yes it is gore and gore upon gore, but more than that it is wickedly funny.  I first watched this movie with a good friend of mine, and we both enjoy a good zombie film now and then, so we have seen just about all there is in movie blood and guts . . . or so we thought!  This is a whole new level.  Thing is, we were laughing ourselves silly throughout the entire film.  It is so wacked and crazy ("over the top" is an understatement!) that the gore becomes hilarious (when even a zombie's entrails can't be killed, you've got trouble!).  Gross? Yes, but somehow so gross that it's not.  If that makes any sense. It's "Dawn of the Dead" meets "Evil Dead" meets Three Stooges meets the Marx brothers meets . . . I don't know what.
One thing's for sure:  You gotta see it to believe it!  In an interview on Charlie Rose Viggo Mortensen and Eljiah Wood said they would love to do a zombie movie with Jackson.  Man, I'd love to see that!
