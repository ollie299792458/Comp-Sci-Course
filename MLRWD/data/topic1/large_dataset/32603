Great package with lots of material for the money.  But of course what we keep coming back to is the fact that, to make the video widescreen, they simply chopped off the tops and bottoms of all the videos.

Often I don't really notice the difference, so I hate to continue the whining too much.  But this decision DOES totally mutilate my otherwise favorite video on here: Radio Ga-Ga (of which you can get the "original" version on the Classic Queen VHS tape).  Radio Ga-Ga's concept was to play around with wide-screen and full-screen video, so the original version changed back and forth between the two: most of the original version was in widescreen (with black bars on the top and bottom of the screen), but during certain sections the black bars disappeared and the video changed back to full-screen for dramatic effect.  Since the tops and bottoms are cut off on this DVD, of course the whole effect is totally obliterated.  Now, the edges of the video expand OUTWARDS during the key moments...but during the rest of the video, you end up seeing the whole video with black on the top and bottom of the screen, AND on the left and right!  So you watch most of it in a small rectangle in the middle of your TV screen.  Absolutely ridiculous.

And the point of DVDs was to show things in their original aspect ratio, without having to pan-and-scan left to right.  Now, since the tops and bottoms are cut off, we're ironically back to pan-and-scan...except instead of going left-and-right, this footage on this DVD is panned-and-scanned up and down to compensate for what they cut off.

Still, this and the first volume of Greatest Video Hits both have so much content for the money, with even better sound than the CDs, so they're still an incredible bargain.  And I'm sure one reason for the "fake" widescreen effect is so they can re-release the videos "restored and remastered" again correctly on Blu-Ray in a few years....
