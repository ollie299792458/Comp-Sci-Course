I can remember going to the theater to see this movie when it first came out. After it came out on DVD, I couldn't help but to purchase it on VHS and then on DVD when it came out. While sitting here reading some of the comments by other reviewers, I can see why they might feel the way they do about this movie and I kind of agree.

However, this is your typical Hollywood movie. Full of action and known for creating movies out of impossible scenarios. Just about every movie to come out of Hollywood is like this. However, it is Entertainment and it surely is a ride. While the movie start the set itself up, and it tends to start off a little slow, the action start to pick up when Tommy Lee Jones and his sidekick "Gator," played by Michael Rispoli, head into the tunnels below Los Angelos and discover the fiery surprise just lurking below the city.

Just when the movie seems to slow down to give you pause, suddenly the action kicks into high gear once more. Once the big 'quake comes along, the movie kicks itself into high "action" gear as Tommy Lee, Don Cheadle and Anne Heche get their characters moving into high form. While the movie does seem to create an impossible and most likely improbable situation, this movie is intended for Action buffs and will likely be entertained by such. If you're a movie fan looking to nitpick at the inaccuracies in this movie, then it's not for you, but it presents an excellent vehicle for Tommy Lee as an "action star."
