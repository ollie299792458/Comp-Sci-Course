First, put aside one's ideological differences-- the movie isn't about ideology (and even I can't necessarily subscribe to all the beliefs of Allen's character).  That is all beside the point.  Joan Allen plays someone of integrity, conservative, liberal, whatever.  This is more than just a political thriller-- it is about the character of a person who is not willing to engage in political mudslinging-- it is beneath her. 
Realistically (unfortunately), Allen's character enters office not through election but through the 25th amendment.  Unrealistically, while integrity such as Allen's character in this movie is at least presumably valued by many Americans, mudslinging may be necessary to get in such a high office as VP, by election, committee or however.  But then, Antigone was a mythical character too.  
But at the core of this movie, it is Allen's performance amid the political machinations of others that is stunning-- her refusal to be anyone but who she is-- a universal theme.  Her loyalty to perform her duty as a public servant is not bound by political parties, but by her own thinking and living.  I suppose if we can't have a role model for integrity on C-span (i.e. Clinton, et al), we can at least have it on film.
After seeing Joan Allen in Pleasantville, I knew this movie would be great.  --I'm looking forward to seeing her in more films in the future.
