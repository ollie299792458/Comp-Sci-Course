I was happy to see that the evaluation copy of The Crazies I received appears to be the only version thus far released, and it appears to NOT go the typical route of "bare movie" disc first and "special edition" disc later.

This single-disc release is chock full of features, including behind the scenes featurettes on the making of the movie and the make-up effects. It also includes several more generic featurettes on "Paranormal Pandemics" and on some of George A. Romero's  prescient "zombie" and "infected" films (The Crazies being a remake of the Romero classic of the same name).

Other features include some animatics detailing how some of the computer visual effects were composited to generate the final completed movie sequences. As well, there are some motion comics, trailers, etc.

The movie is presented in widescreen, looks great, sounds good too. Though, I don't have a high-def TV or surround sound setup, so can't evaluate how the movie looks on the big screen or the particulars of surround sound usage.

From what I've seen, this release is certainly more than sufficient. And better then the average studio release of "bare discs" followed on by overpriced "special editions."

With respect to the movie itself, it's pretty a pretty good horror / infected movie. Without being "zombie" in particular. It definitely sets a mood throughout and sticks with it. The acting is good, as is the cinematography. I won't say much more in terms of plot and specifics. I suppose I will say that there is definitely a lot of violent and disturbing imagery. Not for the squeamish. Graphic special makeup effects depiction of the "infected," as well as violent by and against the infected.
