I had heard the sound track, with Julie Andrews, Rex Harrison, et al, and when I heard that they didn't let Julie in the movie, I was shocked! My Fair Lady, WHITHOUT Julie Andrews?
No Way! But then I saw the movie, and was suprised. Audrey Hepburn is brilliant in the role! The singing for the role, (not by Hepburn, but dubed in) is superb. So for Eliza Doolittle, I give five stars. However-- The acting is good, the sets are good the costumes are good, the music is wonderful, the lyrics are wonderful. But, I am sorry to have to say this, the singing is ludicris. there are exeptions: Rex Harrison is wonderful! I have always known that he falls very short as a singer, but his whole personalaty is just Perfect for 'Enry 'Iggens! And whats his name, as Freddie (I forget the name) is without blemish! The Ascot scene, as a whole, is just hillarious! Perfect! However, "Colonel Pickering", played perfectly by the same actor in the Broadway cast, falls despretly short. And so on. I rcomend you get the vidio now. It is great! Don't miss it. However, get the recording of the Broadway cast, whith Julie Andrews.
