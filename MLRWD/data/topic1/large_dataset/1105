LET'S GO WAY BACK TO 1972-73- OR WAS IT 1974. I SAW THE BOYS AT THEIR " PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION " SHOW.....
NOW. LET'S FAST FORWARD A BUNCH OF YEARS ( 38 OR SO ) , AND A FEW HUNDRED FISH AND CHIPS BUFFET'S ( ABOUT 1000 OR SO) TO THE YEAR 2010. MUSICALLY, THE BOYS STILL GOT IT. SURE, GREG LAKE HAS GROWN AN EXTRA CHIN, BUT HE STILL SOUNDED GREAT, KEITH EMERSON SHOWED ALL OF US THAT HE IS STILL THE MASTER OF KEYBOARDS, AND CARL PALMER REMINDED ME THAT HE WAS THE ONE THAT TOMMY LEE AND NEIL PEART TAKE AFTER ON HOW TO POUND THE DRUMS. TAKING ALL THAT IN CONSIDERATION, THE SOUND AND SHOW WAS TOP NOTCH. NOT GREAT, BUT TOP NOTCH....TOP NOTCH IS A STEP BELOW GREAT.
DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LIKED THE SHOW VERY MUCH AND I AM GLAD I PURCHASED THE DVD. I AM AN ELP FAN FROM DAY ONE, AND THIS SHOW IS A MUST FOR ALL ELP FANS. I JUST HOPE THAT THE BOYS WOULD EAT AT A BUFFET 4 TIMES A WEEK INSTEAD OF SAY, 5......BUT, IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES ELP TO HANG IN THERE AND PLAY UNTIL THEY FALL....WELL, SO BE IT.
OH YEAH..THEY GOT TO BE PUSHING 65. THEY LOOK GOOD FOR THEIR AGE AND I HOPE THEY WILL BE AROUND ANOTHER 40 YEARS....NICE TO SEE THE BOYS AGAIN.
