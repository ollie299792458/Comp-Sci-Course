&#65279;When my wife wanted to see this when it came to the theatre, I said, `yeah right' my not caring too much for comedy having seen too much that was hokey.  Now a year later having purchased one from one of the big rental companies closing out their vhs videos, we watched it and I was pleasantly surprised.  The mannerisms of Ray Romano from "Everybody loves Raymond" was similar and leant to his small town personna as a plumber.  We enjoyed a movie not ripped off from others as we felt the story idea was unique and not presented before.  We enjoyed Marcia

Gay Harden's performance having just seen another fine performance by her several days ago on television in "Felicity: An American Girl Adventure," and "King of Texas" about three years ago.  Also Gene Hackman, another fine actor and one of the best in the versatile roles he plays from Lex Luther in the Superman movies, Royal Tenenbaum in the "Royal Tenenbaums," to this kind of comedy.  I understand this was Ray Romano's first movie.  He has a ways to go but his folksy manner came off okay.  The ending surprised me but I like it when I am surprised.  This

review is from viewing a purchased rental video.
