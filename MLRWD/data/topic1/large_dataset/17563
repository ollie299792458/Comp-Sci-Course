In this remake of the 1949 movie drama.
  Ms.Brooke Shields and Mr.Christopher Atkins play two teens.
Who are marooned on a South Sea isle.Who are trying to cope
with their repressed sexual disires and their navie'outlook
on life.
  The two actors playing their characters of "Em"and "Richard"as two overgrown children.Who play and they are unable to understand
the changes in the world around them 
  Ms.Shields'character is also having trouble accepting Mr.
Atkins amour for her.And Mr.Atkins wants only to leave the
island and return home to San Fransico,Ca.
  When Ms.Shields almost dies from a bite from a rockfish.
 Mr.Atkins takes her to a alter,used by some canibals for
their evil rituals and pleads with the lord to save his cousin.
 Ms.Shields recovers from the bite and it isn't long.
Before the pair are swimming nude and making out in a quiet,
little cove with unrequited joy.
  There is no real plot here and the acting is none exsistent.
The main attraction of "Blue Lagoon" is Mr.Kleiser's filming of
the lush,tropical surroundings of Fiji and the rapport between
Ms.Shields and Mr.Atkins.
  Hence.
  "The Blue Lagoon"is good..if you want to see Ms.Shields'
character making love to Mr.Atkins'"Richard" and seeing
these two take a skinny dip either into a tropical pool
or into the waters of The South Seas?
  But..if you're looking for a meaningful story?
  Believe me..you woint find it here.
  (This film also features camo appearances by William Daniels
and The Late Leo McKern..Despite what one reviewer of this VHS
Print of "Blue Lagoon"has stated.Mr.McKern's character of"Paddy
Button"was not the grandfather of the two kids..(Who were not
played by Ms.Shields and Mr.Atkins..they were played by two other actors).Mr.McKen played a gruff but kindhearted galley
who was also stranded with the kids).
