I felt like I was swept into my own childhood through the lives of these little girls.  Their experience was easily reminiscent of mine (most everyone's?) as I recognized the condition of the universal child, shown, not told, at the mercy of the events and the people in their lives.  I saw the conclusions drawn by the sisters, due to occurrences--conclusions that were sometimes right and sometimes in error as they strove to make sense of and find some small modicum of control in their experience.  Their innocence endured all, giving hope that somewhere within us still exists that same innocence.  What is more, the encouragement to believe that innocence still remains crowns the film, endorsing life in all its difficulty, scarcity and hopeful endurance. The movie has relatively little dialogue.  The meaning is artfully implied by watching the girls as they react to the people and happenings around them.  It is a profound experience of cinematic  deduction--truly unique in its manner of delivering its message.  Bravo!
