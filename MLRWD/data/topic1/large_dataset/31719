If you like explosions, outer space and bedroom scenes don't bother to view this movie. But...if you like real entertainment, the glories of film that can only be greated in B/W and Busby Berkley and a slice of history--The Movie is for You!
What can you say about Berkley? The Master. Sure the premise of the movie is corney. So what else is new? Look at todays movies! It is wonderful to see the actors that went on to fame and fortune in their youth. Joan Blondell, the later whiskey voiced "good ole girl" character part actress, at 19 and probably her 1st and last singing roll. Great!
Ending with the "Forgotten Man" is a real shocker. I thought of Viet Nam vets. Yet this movie doesn't become morbid over the depression. It is there and let's deal with it. As a depression baby all this is only too real to me. The constant stream of men asking for a sandwich and a days work. Too me a wonder tour de force in a musical.
Do view this wonderful film. Don't shy away because it was made in 1933. Relax and have a wonderful family evening.
