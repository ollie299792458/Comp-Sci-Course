I feel sorry for anyone who will be seeing this film for the first time on a DVD on low-end tv set as the screen will not do it justice: not in terms of the glorious cinematography, some great fight scenes and the evocative landscape.

There are many reviews here that already talk about the plot of the film and so forth, so I mainly did this to give an opposing view on some points made by others, making it clear that I am a mere English speaker.

One review says that the Miramax English sub-titles are terrible in general. I would hope that he/she is not comparing it to the meagre offering presented in the official Chinese release DVD, which I own. The Miramax sub-titles are an IMMENSE imrpovement as  they show a far firmer grasp on English idiom. The Chinese release sub-titles read like an ESL book: short, unimaginative and vague. The only time it shows any sort of superiority is near the end where "Our Land" turns out to be the more literal (and more accurate) "All Under Heaven"; and the closing sub-titles are much less cheesy and sentimental. However the Miramax sub-titles cannot be blamed for the fascist tones in the film: the plot and ending of the movie do that very well on their own. In addition, I saw no difference between the two version plot-wise: Miramax was indeed planning to change it, Tarantino protested, and it was left alone for the most part because Miramax stipulated that Tarantino's name had to be at the head of the credits, as you an see on the DVD cover. All this can be learnt at IMDB.

Additionally to say that the movie did not do well in North America is hilariously misguided: it debuted at No.1 and stayed in that spot for two weeks. How many foreign, sub-titled "indie" films manage to do that?

I plan to buy this DVD as well...the movie is that good. :) The characters are interesting, the story is riveting and the cinematography is gorgous (and I don't usually notice such things).
