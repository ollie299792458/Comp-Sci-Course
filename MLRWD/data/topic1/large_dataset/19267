People need to stop comparing Matrix to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as if Matrix was the first movie to have fighting scenes with flying people.  Chinese martial arts movies have been doing fight scenes with people flying for years.  Look at Jet Li's earlier movies such as Tai Chi Masters, Last Hero in China, My Father the Hero, and all his other films and Iron Monkey.  Which has similar scenes to Hidden Dragon such as anti gravity jumps over roof tops.  Even though Matrix and Hidden Dragon had the same fight scene coordinator, the difference is that Matrix used computer genrated special effects, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon only used ropes and man power.  The reason why people in the US hasn't seen fighting scenes like these is because they will get confused.  They wouldn't understand why people are flying or what makes them fly.  Americans believe that the only reason a person could fly is if he had special powers like Superman or the person is not human or the person has some kind of fairy dust.  In conclusion, stop comparing Matrix to other martial arts movies because Matrix didn't start these type of fighting scenes, Chinese martial arts movies did.
