douglas adam fan 2^276,000 here. great set to own. bought this not too long ago when amazon was having a sale on BBC collections. (paid about $22) quality is decent -- can't expect much since it was filmed during the eighties.

still the series itself is great to watch with a great cast -- Simon Jones, Mark Wing-Davey especially. Must have for fans. However, many scenes are juxtaposed in the TV series since it was filmed after the first 2 books and radio series. I recommend listening to the BBC radio series for would-be avid fans or for pure curiosity. It follows the radio script more closely than it does the book so don't be too alarmed by the sequence of events when watching the DVD if you only have the books as a reference to anything H2G2.

The interviews, outtakes, and extra features on the 2nd dvd are interesting but a bit on the dull side -- especially the outtakes (basically 20 minutes of outtakes regarding ONE particular scene).

however, if you enjoyed reading the book, you'll probably enjoy trying out the DVD.
