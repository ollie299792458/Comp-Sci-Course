So I have a Sony Hi Def/ with HDMI in/out; Intel I-3; with Windows 7.(A NEW SONY PC) IT WONT PLAY ANY "HD-DVD" BECAUSE HI-DEF IS ANTIQUATED TECHNOLOGY!! This HD type of DVD was made about 7 years ago, but then VERY few "HD" players were sold BECAUSE "HD DVD" WAS SHUT OUT BY BLUE RAY!!

REMEMBER that battle? - BLUE RAY WON THE COMPETITION after about a year of muddy choices.. HD LOST OUT. THIS DVD IS FROM THAT RARE LOST ERA. IT SHOULD NOT BE SOLD. DONT RISK YOUR MONEY!  BEWARE!!

Neither new or old DVD players can 'ADAPT' to play this useless type "HD" DVD from back in the experimental times.
This my FIRST ONE-STAR REVIEW in 10 years at AMAZON; I want to help others.
Dont confuse this with 'HD-TV CAPABLE,' OR "HDMI 'In and OUT'"- or 'HD Flat-Panels!'  THIS IS USELESS TO ANY OF THOSE.
NOTHING WORKS EXCEPT A VERY RARE ANTIQUE PLAYER!! NOTHING will  adapt to play it!
NOT ONE new player, recorder (DVR), or any of the latest PC's adapt toplay THIS junk!  DO NOT BUY!
Remember the old BETA VIDEO/VCR TAPES? Well,this is a similar, outdated-JUNK MODE on DVD's!! I tried to play this DVDd on a  new Panasonic DVR, and even a 7 year-old BOSE system, after I tried the NEW PC. NOT ONE of my four DVD machines can play THIS dated HD-DVD' failed technology! It sounds kinda strange but its TRUTH.
Consider ALL THE ONE-STAR REVIEWS HERE, they are not all people with crummy DVR's, or second thoughts.
It appears the happy reviews are those who bought the RIGHT KIND AT THE CONCERT!! OR IN ENGLAND!! AND THEY WANT TO SHARE THEIR GREAT CONCERT EXPERIENCE! OF COURSE! GREAT!
 Millions love THE CREAM, and many others find this new DVD tempting. THis is simply the wrong one to buy. You just cant play this one type in any DVD player, of any age, even brand-new top of the line models.
Unless you are an audiophile with a rare type of DVD player- run away from this cheap new DVD! RUN AWAY!!
 CREAM IS THE BOMB!!-
-ONLY when the DVD is not for antique equipment and nothing else!!!!!!!!!!! --PEACE OUT MAN!!//
