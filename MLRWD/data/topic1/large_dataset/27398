The real mystery is how such distinguished actors could have become involved in this mishmash of genres and misstatements of basic historical facts.

Ben Kingsley plays Obi-Wan "Ben" Kenobi right down to the light-saber duel at the end. There is a Bollywood actress who does kung-fu moves. The fact that the Roman Empire had been Christianized is conveniently omitted to emphasize the occult elements.

The Ninth Legion had left Britain about 300 YEARS before these events supposedly took place. Even if there were some remnants still in Britain, the notion that during the hundreds of years since they had any communication with Rome, they would remain loyal to someone who claimed to be "emperor" is laughable.

Of course the whole point of the story is stupid since Little Augustus, "the "Last Caesar" was not a descendent of Julius Caesar at all, but rather appointed emperor by his father, a Roman general.

There are lots of completely ahistorical scenes, like castles that wouldn't appear for another 1000 years and men riding horses with stirrups that wouldn't reach Europe for 400 years. The capital of the Western Roman Empire wasn't even Rome but Ravenna when this story supposedly takes place.

Just dreadful.

My honest pity goes out to all the fine actors that were wasted in this. Ben Kingsley would have been better off taking a part in "Cleaver" which was proposed for him on "The Sopranos"!
