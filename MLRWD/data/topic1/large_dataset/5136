Unlike many other "cheap-thrills" modern horror movies; this masterpiece of a film bases itself more on atmosphere than on fake scares and mindless gore. It's a story taking place around World War 2; about a secluded family living in a large mansion that think their house is inhabited by ghosts.
 Nicole Kidman does an excellent job in potraying the worrying, over-protective mother of two children infected with a rather rare disease. Kidman is undoubtedly one of the most talented actresses present in Hollywood today; and this movie is yet another proof of her remarkable talent. If she wasn't nominated for an academy award in "Moulin Rouge"; I'm sure she would have been nominated for this movie instead.
Some would complain that this movie is too slow-paced for their taste; but that's just the beauty of this picture. The dark atmosphere present in the movie and the great performance of Kidman will somehow keep your interest till the end; even if the lead characters seem to spend nearly half the movie wandering about in the mansion and opening and closing doors. And for all those who taught the ending wasn't surprising at all; and that they figured everything out halfway through; blame the critics. It was them who felt the need to reveal to the readers that the ending was very much similar to "The Sixth Sense". Reading something like that would not take much to figure out what was really going on. Luckily, I didn't read any reviews before I saw the movie; and I was very pleased with how it ended. Recommended to every serious DVD collector out there!
