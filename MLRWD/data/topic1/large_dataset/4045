As a technical director in a very subjectional thinking media business, I can fully understand why some "bad comments" &amp; "bad reviews" of the "bad DVD" were given.  But...while working  for a very single minded...very focused...very perfectionistic media talent  myself, I more so understand Stanley Krubrick's request to have the viewer  "view" the work as "he" viewed it.  That is to  say...one mindless reviewer said something to the nature that the DVD  version on his home theatre "surround-sound-dolby-pro-logic-5,000  channel-THX-super-dooper-cienema-head &amp;  balls-to-the-wall-megaplex-titanical-killer" system sounded....WEAK!  Well put yourself in Krubrick's shoes in the late 70's/early 80's  production field you Joe Schmoe!  The whole "idea" for DVD (I  believe)is to "FULLY" try to convey &amp; have you see what the  creator/director saw &amp; filmed...in his eyes, not in some souped-up,  re-re-re-re-remastering lab that has a tendency to put out over-glorified  "never-meant-to-be-coloured-that-way" re-re-re-re-releases!  If  it looked "hazy" or "fuzzy" and sounded  "narrow" or "pointed"...well maybe...just  maybe...that's the way Krubrick "specifically" invented that  particular wheel to "specifically" carry his particular  thought's. Duhhhh!
