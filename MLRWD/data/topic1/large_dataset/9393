I love this movie!
Why? 
Because, for one, Sandra Bullock is absolutely great in this funny movie about a cop (FBI Agent, whatever) who joins a beauty pagent 'Scholarship Fund' to go undercover and find the an infamous killer.
I just got the DVD the other day and love the hilarious out takes and great never before seen footage.
I think I've now watched it about five times in those two days and, as pathetic as this may seem, plan on watching it again real soon.
Sandra and Michael Collin's screen relationship is completely charming, their scenes becomming the main reason to watch this movie. They have a great chemistry, as do Sandra Bullock and Benjamin Bratt, whom the movies love story centers around.
I ain't gonna tell you anymore, but just to watch out for Candice Bergan and William Shatner's great partnership in  solving the crime, well sort of...
I love this movie because it focuses on what great movies are about. Being fun and all around entertaining.
Five Out Of Five.
