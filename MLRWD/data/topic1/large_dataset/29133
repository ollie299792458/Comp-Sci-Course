The main character, Boris Kodjoe, wasn't really that superb in this film. Although he's a good television actor, he wasn't really ready for the big screen. I think the producers used his looks to attract the females to seeing the movie more so than his acting. Someone said in an interview that he did all off his singing...false. It was so obvious that he was lip-syncing over someone else's deeper voice. And Tamyra Gray...that was a no no having her as a lead actress and singer. Did you not hear her when she opened with the Star Spangled Banner for the American Idol finale' season three...a big NO NO! She's not developed as an actor to do big screen yet, and her singing could use a fine tuning. She has a way to go before she becomes believable as a serious actress. Again, something to draw men to the theater. I understood where the movie was trying to go, and anyone who's read the bible or even been to church knows the story, but the movie just didn't take you there. I enjoyed the music because I'm a singer, but the movie just didn't take you where it should've. There were too many holes in the movie. Plus, it didn't really teach anyone who doesn't know about the Gospel. To me, it even made the veteran actors look like amateurs. I did enjoy seeing Omar Gooding stretch his wings and show versatility. I would love to see him in more versatile roles in the future. He's really a great actor when he gets great scripts. I think the singing and the major singers is what drew people to see this film because the acting was really bad and unbelievable, and the over dubbed singing was horrible. It was so many times that the music and the singers were not linked. I'm a analyzer when it comes to movies and a movie buff (owning overr 600 movies), so I definitely saw the flaws in this film. I still love the producers because I own some of his movies, and they are superb at what they do, but the actors where just not believable and had no chemistry with each other.
