I have not yet seen the Film, but am a BIG Fan of the Series! It is supposed to be Good. Also I know that it is starring Corey Feldman, who I know from Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, Stand by Me and The Goonies! But what I do not understand is why they can't make a Collection including:

PUPPET MASTER

PUPPET MASTER II

PUPPET MASTER III. TOULON'S REVENGE

PUPPET MASTER 4

PUPPET MASTER 5. THE FINAL CHAPTER (WINK, WINK)

CURSE OF THE PUPPET MASTER

RETRO PUPPET MASTER

PUPPET MASTER: THE LEGACY

DEMONIC TOYS

DOLLMAN

DOLLMAN VS. DEMONIC TOYS

PUPPET MASTER VS. DEMONIC TOYS

AND THEY'VE GOT A COLLECTION ON AMAZON.CO.UK INCLUDING

PUPPET MASTER

PUPPET MASTER II

DEMONIC TOYS

PUPPET MASTER: THE LEGACY

AND WHAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF, WAS THAT THEY MADE A COLLECTION INCLUDING:

PUPPET MASTER

PUPPET MASTER II

PUPPET MASTER III. TOULON'S REVENGE

PUPPET MASTER 4

PUPPET MASTER 5. THE FINAL CHAPTER (WINK, WINK)

CURSE OF THE PUPPET MASTER

RETRO PUPPET MASTER

FULL MOON 45 TRAILER REEL BONUS DISC

AND THEN THEY DISCONTINUED IT! IT WAS ONLY ABOUT $70-$60. NOW TO FIND IT ON EBAY, IT'S ABOUT $300-$500! WHY! AND HOW COME PUPPET MASTER III IS $25 ON THIS WEB SITE, PUPPET MASTER 4 IS $59 AND PUPPET MASTER 5 IS $259!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

WHY?
