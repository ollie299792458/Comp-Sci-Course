Sad to say that I missed The Who's heyday by a few years.  I only was exposed to their music in high school when I happened to catch "The Kids Are Alright" on Cinemax around 1982.  I was mesmerized by their  intensity and their musical passion.  
The versions of "Baba  O'Reily" &amp; "Won't Get Fooled Again" that they recorded  especially for this film are among the best versions of those songs the  band ever did.  And the sound quality is near studio quality level since  they were doing those numbers especially for the film.  And the laser/light  effects, although tame by today's standards, are still pretty cool.  Also,  there are other songs in the film (and on the soundtrack) that are only  available here.  
This film is a must have in any video/dvd collection of  the above-average to serious music lover.  If you were too young to have  gotten into The Who, or if you just happened to miss them during their  years of making music (like I ALMOST DID) then pick this film up, it will  open up a whole new realm of great music from a great rock band!
