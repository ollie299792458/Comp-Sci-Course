We bought this for my son who is about to turn 4 in October.  He started out watching some older Scooby VCR "movie" tapes that have been around our house for quite a while.  After watching those to death, the prospect of some "new" (to our son) Scooby features had him glued to his seat; at least for the first 4-5 times he watches them.  These are supposed to be "scary" to those under the age of 5-7 but that doesn't phase our little guy.

I think I was getting out of high school when these first aired on TV so I never had(and still don't have) much interest in them.  But my wife who is a bit younger even remembers watching some of the episodes.  They have the "original" gang of characters (let's face it, Scrappy sucks) with the dependable, if predictable plot lines.

If you like your pancakes just the way mom used to make them, here they are with plenty of syrup.  If you're looking for "Citizen Kane", Francis Ford Coppola or Oliver Stone, like forget it, man (zoinks!). This and a good part of seasons 1&2 (double set) kept my little guy occupied for a good part of the time during two weeks of vacation (he also had regular fun and watched some more educational TV as well, but if he got bored or out of sorts, "want to watch Scooby?" usually got his attention). And of course, the "monsters" are not really real and nobody gets hurt.  Brain candy, don't eat too much...
