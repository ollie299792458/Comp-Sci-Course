Disappointing, unfortunately.  I don't know who decided to stage this between mafiosi, but it's hard to care about which gangster ends up prevailing in a situation like that.  The staging had some potential, but was just too self-conscious -- and there shouldn't even BE cinematography, pickup shots(!!!), or cross-cut camera angles in an opera.  The camera was FAR too intrusive; three-camera sitcom with occasional medium shots is fine for most staged operas, including this one.  Whoever decided to use the camera in an artsy way should have been vetoed with extreme prejudice.  The performers suffered greatly from the closeups.  Closeups are completely inappropriate when the people on stage are acting to reach the cheap seats; they also cut off all large-area staging until everyone looks like they are staring into nothing while singing.  Many times, I couldn't even tell where the performers were standing relative to one another.

Costuming in this era could have been better; I've seen other plays moved to this time period and done well, including a very good "Othello" by the San Diego Women's Rep company.  Here, though ... Michael Chance is not by any means a bad-looking man, and while they were going for a more "realistic" look, they should still have costumed him as an unfairly put-upon hero and not a wood-alcohol soaked bum.  There was just no reason for that.

The ONLY good thing about this, thank God, is the singing.  Chance's falsetto isn't at the Scholl or Daniels level, but his da capos are wonderfully inventive and daring.  The other voices were all excellent, especially Paul Nilon, who is just the sort of ringing clear tenor I'd love to hear in a high Rossini role or as Mario Cavaradossi.  GORGEOUS voice.

If only the absurdly artsy staging didn't swamp them all ...  Buy this to listen to it.  It's worth ripping the audio and playing that alone.
