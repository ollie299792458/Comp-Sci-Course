I saw a trailer for fire in the sky when I was young, can't remember how old but between ten and thirteen. I've always had a fear of the "Grey" style of aliens, mostly because I've always believed that these particular kinds of aliens exist. Maybe it's just me, maybe I've watched too many discovery channel and Learning channel specials on alien abductions. But the trailer alone gave me nightmares as a kid, and I've been wanting to see it ever since.

At least once a year I go looking for the movie in stores and at local movie rental places like Blockbuster, to no avail. not on DVD VHS or any other media. So this year I said to myself: "that's it! I'm just going to find it online." One amazon purchase later and I'm watching a movie that's been on my mind for several years for the first time. and it won't be the last.

Fire In The Sky is a movie about a man who was once abducted by aliens. He was absolutely traumatized by the event, and had amnesia about it as well, but through a series of flashbacks he gets his memory of the event back. As he gets his memories of the event about rhe spacecraft back it's depicted to the viewer.

It's quite a good movie with stellar performances, and engaging characters. I highly recommend it. Especially to anyone that's a fan of alien movies.
