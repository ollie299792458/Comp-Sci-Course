Finally watched this movie, after years of hearing raves.

Full disclosure: I'm a sucker for a good, sentimental romance. Love Cary Grant. Love Deborah Kerr.

But this movie is overwhelmingly cheesy -- when it's not overpoweringly saccharine, that is. The script is hackneyed, and the major plot twist is preposterous. Without adding a spoiler here, does the very perceptive and intelligent Terry McKay not know how to use a telephone? or write a letter? If they love one another as profoundly as they both know, then certainly Nickie would not have rejected her, but embraced her unconditionally. The shark jumps even higher when the Treacle Children's Choir shows up. TWICE, just in case their 'cuteness' wasn't hammered home the first time. Awful. Rated IN-13; insulin recommended for viewers over 13.

Really, don't bother. If you've not seen it yet, you're not missing anything. If you want to watch a really *superb* sentimental love story, run-don't-walk to "I Know Where I'm Going": <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004XQMY">I Know Where I'm Going! - Criterion Collection</a>
