I am so proud. I saw this movie years ago, but recently watched it again and it took me back 13 years, to when I was 16 and madly infatuated with Lestat. A breeze would blow open my curtain at night and I would stiffen thinking it would reveal Lestat in my window, to which I would say, "Please...go" and he would respond, "But you've been calling me for some time, my love." Sounds irresponsible to me now that I'm 29 and haven't visted the Vampire Chronicles in a long time. Sounds young and childish to a flaw. However, when I first heard about this movie I was enraged that Tom Cruise and BRAD PITT were playing the leading roles! WHAT? I blanched. I mean, come on, aren't they just too pretty? However, when I began to see pictures of what they made Tom Cruise look like for the role, I was taken aback. "That IS Lestat," I thought. And Pitt is not so pretty, but his frail figure was perfect for Louis. I had to admit I did the same thing when I found out Lucas had digitally altered the Star Wars Trilogy, but then again, who am I? He's the author. And so, when I read that Anne had overseen this and was pleased, I thought...well, who am I? If one the greatest and enthralling authors of all time says she likes what Hollywood has done to her book, then I must trust, right?

So, I loved it. I will always love it, I'm sure. Antonio was eloquent and just as hard and uncaring as the book portrayed his character, Santiago. Oh, and beautiful Claudia...could Kirsten Dunst been out performed by anyone? She really did a fantastic job.

I couldn't be more pleased.
