After rewatching this film recently on DVD, I have reconfirmed my belief that this is one of the most mystical, awe inspiring films ever made.  With the possible exception of ET, this is the closest Steven Spielberg has come to making a religious film.
Set in a small town in Illinois (aka Spielbergville), it tells the story of Roy Neary and his encounter with a UFO.  Roy is trapped in a meaningless job in an unhappy marriage with his unimaginative kids.  Roy and others like him will embark on a quest that will lead them to first contact with aliens (hence the title).  As in many Spielberg films, certain themes and events re-occur, eg. reluctant fathers, abduction of children by supernatural forces, references to world war two and old movies, and a sense of fear and wonder of the unknown.
Adding to the wonderful story, Spielberg has at his disposal terrific special effects and a wonderful John Williams score.  Who will ever forget the final incredible half hour when the UFOs dance overhead bathing us with beautiful colours and light while communicating with us via music.  You simply sit back and let the sights and sounds envelop you.
Along with 2001, this is one of the greatest of all sci-fi movies.
