Ricardo Montalban's performance as Khan in Star Trek II is nothing short of marvelous. It really deals with Khan's reclusive nature after being stranded on Seti Alpha V by Capt. Kirk in "Space Seed", and leaves to door wide open to Khan's obsession growing to the point where his own men are concerned. Kirk conversely is dealing with the fact that he is not the young adventurer he used to be and I must say seems to capture some actual feeling of gloom as he considers retirement or taking back his command. Suspicious though is the opinion of Bones. You might remember in the first film, McCoy was very much against Kirk getting the ship back and now supports his friend on this mission. As for Kirk, the approach to old age in "Khan" definitely is the more genuine between the two films, which says a lot for the acting of William Shatner. The only true constant is of course Spock. Although never face to face, both Spock and McCoy agree Kirk should have remained a captain. You still get a lot of classic Trek moments such as a scene in Kirk's quarters where he has to referee a philosophical argument between his two old friends.

Star Trek II is also the beginning of casting top notch actors as villains, a trend that lasted until Nemesis. (the role of captain wasn't as diverse until passed to Patrick Stewart either.) Khan is definitely a classic film. Blending together humor, drama and very important sub-plots that carry through to this day. Wether you're a Trek fan or not, buy this one.
