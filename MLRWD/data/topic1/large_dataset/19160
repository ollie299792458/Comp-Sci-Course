Nothing personal Mr. Gary F Taylor, but the condition they portray in the film IS a Backdraft. Maybe your father was a firefighter, that does not make you one, I AM a professional firefighter. A flashover is when the temperature of a room reaches the point that it causes all of the pyrolytic gasses of the contents of the room to spontaneously ignite, this usually occurs between 1000 and 1400 degrees F. A backdarft is a fire that has darkened down due to a lack of oxygen. When oxygen is suddenly introduced to said room the built up, superheated fire gasses explode or "combust in a rapid and uncontrolled manner".
  The scene of the rookie opening the door without first checking for heat and being caught in the sudden explosion is a TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE of a backdraft.
  Beyond that, yes the movie is unrealistic, IT'S A MOVIE! What movie is NOT unrealistic in at least some aspect? It is entertainment NOT a documentary! From an entertainment standpoint it was very captivating.
  So how about quit trying to be something you are not and just ENJOY THE MOVIE!
