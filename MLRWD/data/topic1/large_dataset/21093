This movie is now 45 years old! It still holds up so well - and is maybe even more important now in this age where privacy is a sham, and anything that happens is on the Internet all over the world in nanoseconds.

The power of a 'whisper campaign' or the 'power of a lie.' Why would you take the word of a screaming, scheming little girl as the absolute truth? Wouldn't you want to 'make sure' first? The first revival of 'The Children's Hour' was done, ironically, while Hellman was up before Joe McCarthy for 'UnAmerican Activities.' I remember Hellman herself years later thanking Joe McCarthy for everything he did that helped her career - the opposite of what he intended.

I wish Audrey Hepburn was alive to comment on this movie - the first movie made after the Hayes Motion Picture Code was liberalized. Maclain says that the 'L' word was never part of their vocabulary during the making of the film. Not a movie about lesbianism but a powerful movie about the 'power of suggestion' used for evil purposes.
