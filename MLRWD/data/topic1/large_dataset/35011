First off, I'd like to say that I'm very impressed with the quickness of the second season release.  I hope the rest of the series is as timely. That being said, I think Universal cheaped out a bit with the second season. The first season came is superior in almost every respect:

1. better graphics

2. a presentation folder that holds all the disks

3. each disk has a photo inlay of Peter Falk

4. Coloumbo quotes peppered hear and there

5. each episode is NOT preceeded by an annoying Universal

identification short (the logo of Universal, not sure what to call that)

Season 2 is simply a presentation box sleeve and 2 cheap clam shell DVD cases inside. I was also hoping that the second season would contain maybe a little bonus material. Photo stills... something!?! I do like the little episode preview before every episode,thats something the first season collection didn't have.

Anyway, I rate the NBC Mystery Movie Columbo Series 5 STARS all the way! But, I think the set could have been a little bit better.
