Season two has just been released, and I have already sped right through all 23
delightful episodes!  I have enjoyed this show far more than I thought possible!
The action, romance, humor, suspense & intrigue are out in full force yet again,
& it has made for many enjoyable evenings.  There are some really cute episodes
in this season, along with a few that really get your pulse racing.  My favorite
episodes would be "The Three Faces of Eve", "Ship of Spies", "Burn Out" & "Odds
On a Dead Pigeon".  My favorite part of the show is the budding relationship
between Amanda & Lee.  I love the kind of romances that develop out of friendship,
instead of the instantaneous attractions that are purely physical.

I only have 3 complaints.
1.)  ... the last episode was very anti-climactic.
2.)  ... how realistic is it that top level 'agents' keep telling EVERYONE their
real names?  I mean... every mob member & hit-man in & out of the country knows
the names and locations of Lee and Amanda, and YET somehow the Mom and kids are
totally clueless.  There have even been numerous occasions when Amanda tells her
mom straight out, and the Mom just rolls her eyes.  That baffles me.
3.)  ... Kate Jackson needed a new hair stylist for at least half of this season.
She looks like she aged about 10 years.

Overall, hands down, and complaints aside, this is one fantastic show!  I'm so
thrilled that I have the chance to own it!  Warner brothers..... PLEASE bring
out the next 2 seasons soon!  Don't leave us in the lurch.  We simply have to
see where the adventures lead to next!  ;)
