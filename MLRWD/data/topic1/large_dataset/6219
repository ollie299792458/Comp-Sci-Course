Just like the other reviewers i walked into buying this with a little bit of hesitation. Everybody on amazon seems to be pretty on point with their reviews. So i bought it, popped it in, and, whoah. To my complete surprise, this movie was really good. It's not in anyway a parody or remake or anything, and I don't even find it that funny.

It's basically about 4 teenagers who leave the prom and almost immediatly after find themselves in good `ol Sawyer-ville. From then on is pretty much your typical Texas Chainsaw flick, torture, murder, etc.
Matthew McConaughey was terrific and played a sick, sick dude with some serious problems. I don't even know if any character in this franchise came close to being as wild as he is in this role. Renee Zelwegger was great too, and her acting was top notch. When she's being screamed at or tied up or hit around, the look on her face is pure terror. Leatherface was great. Everybody says that he was a wimp because he wore makeup and a dress and was bitched around by everyone else and such, but I think he was as creepiest as he's ever been(next to gunnar hansen's portrayal, of course). He looks absolutly creepy as hell in drag, and I don't get how people say he's a wimp when he still doesn't hesitate to bring down the sledge on some arrogant teenager's skull like the hammer of thor. If anything, part 2 was the comedy of the series, and since the first one, this is the only one that gave me that awkward feeling about watching it. McConaughey's character is so sick and twisted it makes you feel dirty just watching it. I say buy it and go into it not expecting a funny movie, but expecting another sadistic torture flick that damn well earns the right to bear the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" name.
