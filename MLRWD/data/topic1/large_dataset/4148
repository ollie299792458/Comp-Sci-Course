"The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is my favorite movie in the whole wide world. The songs are timeless and most of the performances are truly classic. Anyone who thinks Tim Curry should have won the Oscar for his performance in this film, raise your hand. I think so, too!
I really do like this DVD, but I would actually only recommend it to people who have never seen the movie before. I will explain. As everyone knows, the thing about "Rocky Horror" is the audience participation. If you just watch the movie by yourself in your living room, it is fun, but not as fun as hearing people shout witticisms at the screen. With this DVD you can watch the movie by yourself, and take in all the madness..but you can also experience the live aspect with the feature that allows you to hear the callbacks and see a live "Rocky" cast performing. I think that's an excellent and necessary feature of a DVD version of such a film.
Now, purists such as myself might be a little disappointed at this DVD. The "hilarious outtakes" and such are not different than those which were featured on the 20th Anniversary laserdisc. It kinda nullifies having to buy the DVD, but if you really really want to, it's not a bad idea. Hearing Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn's (Riff-Raff and Magenta, respectively) running commentary is worth the price of admission, so go ahead and splurge. :)
