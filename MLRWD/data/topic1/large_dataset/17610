I don't know where to start other than saying that the movie Chisum is better than having no movie about John Chisum. I'm afraid Hollywood has done another number on history when it would have been just as easy to do a correct film. Where to start? Sallie came West with her father, James, brother's Will and Walter from Denton County Texas. Also her other uncle Pitzer was at the ranch as well. None shown in the film. Sallie never was "back East" and was just a girl of 17 when she came to Roswell (Where they lived, not near Lincoln.) John Tunstall was 24 years old, not middle aged as every film is somehow required to shown. John was 64 when he died, I guess you can call him aged. William Bonney was a meek, young, wet behind the ears, follower until there was not many left to led the Regulators. A product of the media of the times. John Wayne gives his usual good performance in this type of role. He can only follow the script. It's interesting, worth the money if you don't expect to find history here.
