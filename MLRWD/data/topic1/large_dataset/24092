Those who say that this movie is an insult to the spirit of the book by Dickens are completely missing the point.  Textuality dictates that reciting the same story that was amazing in print will turn out contrived  and vacuous in celluloid.  It shows the spirit of Dickens' work -  completely loss in spite of danger, the loss of heart and being.  It's a  story that hinges on that great tragic moment in love which Romeo and  Juliet made so clear to us all (esp. in Shakespeare in Love).
The movie  is rich in narration and exploits a directorial narrative.  The ebb and  flow of visions, places, people, and unrelated occurrences turn into a  melange which has all the warped lucidity of one's best and most painful  memories.  
The direction is fantastic as is the cinematography. The  greatest genius of this movie is the use of the hauntingly frozen Life in  Mono by Mono.  Regrettably, this portishead-ish band's other songs didn't  have quite the presence of this song that gave the movie its icy  ambience.
Especially loved the Dinsmore character.  Much more batty and  manipulative than the simply grotesque and warped Havisham of the  book.
Additionally, the recounting of Gwyneth (Estella) may seem flat and  one-dimensional; however, isn't that the way one remembers the players in  one's memories - as automata which reacted to us singularly in the stage of  life?
It's an amazing film.
