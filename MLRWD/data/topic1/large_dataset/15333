Moonraker is actually the first Moore 007 title I've ever purchased. Despite some obviously dated effects (e.g., several "matted in" 'aereal' scenes), this was a very pleasant surprise in every way in terms of both the film itself and the quality of the Blu-ray. Lots of action, plus a cool plot, and some funny lines from Mr. Moore and the very entertaining "Jaws" character that always turns up no matter where 007 goes! I think the space scenes give it a nice added hint of sci-fi that you don't always get in Bond films. I actually enjoyed the film so much and the beautiful cinematography (particularly in Rio de Genaro) that I watched it again as soon as it was over just to look at the stunning image quality! If you're both a bond fan and a real sucker for excellent image and sound quality, this Blu-ray disc is a treat! I only have a 720P plasma, and this film from 1979 has better image quality than some more recent films. (E.g., Just saw Blu-ray of Bram Stoker's Dracula from '92. A much newer film, but of course perhaps due to artistic intent, with a decidedly softer image. Certainly Better than a standard DVD, but nowhere near as sharp as Moonraker). The 5.1 HD Master Audio track is also quite robust and pretty directional for its age. Many of the scenes boast almost 3-D-like image quality, with jaw-dropping color and detail (check out the scene where 007 is on a boat looking through a telescope. The lens almost "jumps" out of the screen.) The aereal scenes and scenes in Rio de genaro and Venice have to be seen to be appreciated. The detail in the buildings and scenery is outrageous! Blu-ray is here to stay... simply the most amazing video medium ever... Like a great car you want to keep driving, the more I experience Blu-ray the more I appreciate it. I'm buying films I've never owned before because of it... now all I need are "Jaws", "War of the Worlds '05", "Titanic" and the "Jurassic Park" series to come out...
