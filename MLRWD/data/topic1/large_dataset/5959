This Oscar-nominated film for best foreign movie depicts the dilemma of two suicide bombers who were assigned to the job, but were both hesitant to do what they were asked to do. The film is one of the rare voices of peace and moderation through which director Hany Abu-Assad sends several messages.
First, poverty is not the only reason behind this form of Palestinian violence. Suicide bombing is rather tied to a host of other sociocultural reasons. Along these lines, Abu-Assad presents a dialogue between two of his minor characters in which one of them says: "Look at Sweden, all people there are wealthy but it has the highest suicide rate in the world."
Second, through his female character Suha, the daughter of a late famous Palestinian leader, Abu-Assad denounces violence on the premise that violence would only bring further violence.
Third, one of the two suicide bombers put forward very personal reasons for his suicide action.
Fourth, Abu-Assad very smartly creates the picture of the junior Palestinian leadership that is mostly on the run and that is believed to be behind the planning and execution of suicide operations. In this film, the leader who is on the run looks very unstable, shaky and nervous, in a clear indication that such leaders are not all of the time operating in their full mental capacity.
