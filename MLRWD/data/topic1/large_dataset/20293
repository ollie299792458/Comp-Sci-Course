This is a great way to own all of Bruce Lee's movies (except for Enter the Dragon) for a low price! If you're skeptical about the quality of these DVDs, rest assured that the image quality is pretty darn good as far as old Hong Kong movies go. All of the movies are in 2.35 anamorphic widescreen. The Big Boss looks very sharp with rich colors. Way of the Dragon looks a little "softer", but this is most likely due to the film quality itself rather than the transfer. Game of Death looks great, with sharp detail and good contrast. In addition, you get optional Cantonese audio tracks as well as the original Mandarin audio tracks. I've read one reviewer state that Bruce Lee's war cries are screwed up on the DTS tracks. I only watched these movies with the Mandarin mono audio tracks and I didn't notice anything fishy about the cat calls. So if the English dolby tracks are screwed up, you can always watch them with the original Mandarin tracks; they should be unaffected.

One thing I should point out is the English audio track on Game of Death (which was the original language of the movie) is not very clear and you may need to turn on English subtitles to understand what characters are saying at some points in the film, but again I think this is due to original quality of the dialogue rather than the transfer.

If you don't have any Bruce Lee movies and want to see what all the fuss is about or if you want to acquire a complete collection, buy this set! You won't regret it! Don't let a couple of very unforgiving reviewers cast any doubts in your mind. This is as good as you're gonna get for a domestic release. I was VERY happy with my purchase.
