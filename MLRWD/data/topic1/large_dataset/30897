A friend and I rented this with low expectations, and we were both very pleasantly surprised.  This is a suave, cool, thoughtful thriller, but one that cuts against the grain of the usual action movie fare.  If you're a Schwarzenegger fan, this movie isn't for you.  But if you're a Hitchcock fan, I think you'll have some fun with _The International_.  Just about all the comments note the exceptional visual design of the film, and it really is impressive.  But Clive Owen is what makes this movie go, and his performance is excellent.  Also generally excellent is the work of the supporting cast, with special kudos to the great actor Armin Mueller-Stahl.  Naomi Watts' role is oddly ancillary, but I think that's a result of intelligent decisions made by the writer about the nature of her relationship with Owen (the scene where she and Owen talk during Owen's interrogation of Mueller-Stahl is excellent and reveals her real function in the film, I think).  If you come to this film expecting the usual action movie roller coaster, you'll be disappointed.  But what you get is actually better: an elegant blend of content and style.
