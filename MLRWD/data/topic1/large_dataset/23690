It is refreshing to find a movie with a plot this surprising.  One has to admire the old boy when it all becomes clear for the viewer.  Robert Duval does a great job (doesn't he always?) and basically it is a well acted and directed movie.  Duval's character shows more affection for his old mule than most would think possible, but he brings to mind old fellas I knew as a younger man that shared a good relationship with their mules, or horses they worked with for years.
  The cinematography is very good, the soundtrack and overall sound engineering is about as good as you see in any movie, and it is always nice to see period correct props and architecture throughout the show. This story reminds me of some of the stuff Faulkner wrote about the South, and his ability to convey to the reader the simple realities of human emotions and their affect on the paths we take in life.  The production company and screenwriters too I suppose, were able to get the major point across so well in this movie.  Duval's character had an unending capacity to love one woman at a level few care to imagine. His inability to accept what he perceived as a wrong on his part, was to say the least profound, so very profound as to cause him to make of his life something far different than he at first expected.
  It is a great movie, well worth the price here on Amazon, and one that I will definitely watch once or twice a year with the wife, for she dearly loved the show too.
