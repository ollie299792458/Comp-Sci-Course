This DVD is better than other versions that I've seen on Jacob. It isn't an easy story to tell.

I've read this story so many times over the years and some of it is so strange to me. This movie portrayed both Rachel and Leah as beautiful, but Leah's pain of being unloved by her husband was heartbreaking. I love the way Jacob gave her respect and tried to be fair to her, because it was not her fault that he was deceived.

That's the thing that always bothers me. The deceit in the story. It's so difficult to understand. It does make a little more sense after seeing it. For example, Rebekah's plan to benefit one of her sons over another. She wasn't especially likable. In reading the story I've always had problems with how lovely she was when she became Isaac's wife and how she loved one son at the expense of the other, not lovely at all. The movie doesn't help with that one. Was this God's doing? It isn't any more clear now, but it makes my head hurt. God's ways are mysterious. I will never understand the situation completely, but I will trust Him.

I didn't like the scene with the donkey falling down the cliff because it was unnecessary and it wasn't in the scriptures.

I loved the way they showed Laban manipulating the situation to his favor, but at the same time, being entirely appropriate for the culture of his time evidently. He was almost likable - almost.

The relationship between Jacob and Esau was a little more civil than I had thought. Also, the caravan (profession) was described in detail in the Bible and a little different from this movie. That was an important point for me as I read the story.

There is so much about this story that I will never understand. One of those difficult parts is when Jacob wrestled with God and prevailed. This movie did a fine job with it.

All-in-all, they have made the story as close as I could have hoped for. I liked this presentation very much. It made me think.
