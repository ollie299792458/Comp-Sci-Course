While Today You Die is not a horrible maovie, it just isn't an exciting one either.  While I praise Seagal for keeping the movies coming, I can't praise the excitement level of his newer films.  The age and weight of Seagal I guess is catching up with him, and therefore his level of skill in the martial arts department is diminishing.  While he still kicks butt and keeps the bone-breaking alive, there is no skill to it in this movie.

The story in Today You Die is nothing exciting either.  The Seagal character is set up and set to prison.  He escapes with the help of an inmate.  The two become partners and get revenge for the guys who sent the Seagal character up.  There is a twist with one of the chracters in the film, the only interesting part, but nothing that you  may not have already seen coming.  The lack of story requires more action than this movie provides.  While scenes seem to cange often, attempting at keeping pacing strong, it still fails to heighten our most entertaining movie senses.

The bright spot of the movie is Vegas.  If you love Vegas there are plenty of clips of the city, during the day and during the night.  Perhaps the only good spot of the movie is after the first 15 minutes of thie film, there is a decent car chase scene through downtown at night.  You don't get many movies for a chase through Vegas, and this is pretty much the only reason for buying this dvd.

This movie turns out to be only good for watching the first time, just to see what happens.  Unlike most action movies that I can watch over and over for the action, I can't say that this is even worth it.  Check out the chase scene in Vegas and that's all that is worthy.
