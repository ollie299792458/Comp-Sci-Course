Red Dawn is a movie featuring many popular teenage actors like Patrick Swayze, Lea Thompson, and Charlie Sheen.  Although a little chimerical, I give this move 3 stars.  Red Dawn gives the allusion that Russia and Cuba are nefarious empires seeking to become the world power.  With many action scenes and unheralded foul language, some might believe this film should be more censorious.  To be laconic, it's all about a group of teens who suppress themselves from the depleted town to the mountains.  However, they cannot forget their fellow Americans and decide to try and assuage the problem of the enemy taking over.  Even with the Russian's behemoth tanks and oscillating strategies, these "Wolverines" aren't malcontent on just sitting back.  It seems impossible in real life a group of inexperienced teens could actually fight trained Russians and Cubans, but once you get into the movie you forget how impossible most of the scenes are.

However, even with the Wolverines myopic view of war, they do fell many enemies.  Without any tanglible food, tarnished supplies, many quandaries, and a paucity of back-up, these teens really do make a difference.  Characters like Swayze are herioc without ingratiating themselves.  It is hard to believe that this group could actually survive in the mountains, fight an enemy, and still have survivors in the end.  For it's time, I'd say John Milius, the director, did a good job with casting.  This film is proficient entertainment, despite the impossibility of Russia and Cuba coming over to America out of nowhere and attacking.  All in all, it's a good movie.
