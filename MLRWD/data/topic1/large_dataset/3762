King of Devil's Island, a film by Marius Holst, starring Stellan Skarsgard.  This 2011 Norwegian film tells the true story of the infamous Bastoy Reform School situated on the Alcatraz-like island of Bastoy in the Oslo fjord. Bastoy's school housed delinquent male juveniles aged 11-18 years of age from the 1900 until 1953, who had committed crimes as heinous as stealing out of the church collection box. The events detailed in the film occurred in 1915 with the arrival of 17 year old Erling, a rumored murderer. The bleak Norwegian landscape is beautiful and infuses the film with its cold isolation. We watch as Erling struggles with his individual desire to escape and the devastating consequences for the group. King of Devil's Island is a fascinating look at the development of the individual's attachment to the group. The cinematography is stunning and the entire cast is exceptional. This is a dark, brooding and haunting film; terrifying and brutal, it ends on a hopeful note. Stellan Skarsgard is an exceptional actor who is underutilized by Hollywood.
