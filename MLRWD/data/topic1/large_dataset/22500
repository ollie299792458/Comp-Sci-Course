" El topo " ( 1970 ) is an iconoclast and political "western" where the director of " Fando y Lis " and " Santa sangre " attacks with mocking and surreal thought-provoking invention the wild colonialism perpetrated by the U.S.A. Establishment in particular and totalitarisms in general. But the film is too the mystical and oniric journey of his protagonist, played by Jodorowsky himself, an aenigmatic cowboy who looks for the four masters of the gun to challenge them. Jodorowsky, foundator with Fernando Arrabal and Roland Topor of the surrealist group " Panico ", uses deliberately the most manipulated U.S.A. cinematographic genre, the western movies, taking it in the opposite way hollywood directors usually do, this is, subverting the topicals and lies we usually find in epics. " El topo " is inspired by zen culture, biblical fragments and the south-american surrealist stream, so as by cowboy pulp novels, the spaguetti western, chamanism and psycho-magics. A surreal, sexual-shocking and sardonic political western by this polyfacetic and always stimulating chilean artist.
