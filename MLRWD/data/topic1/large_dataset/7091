Jim Carrey once again shows us his crazy and wacky side with this movie. Meet Charlie(Carrey), real nice guy with the Rhode Island State Police force. Unfortunatelly, his wife leaves him for an overly-challenged african american, and the 2 have three sons. Instead of totally expressing his anger, Charlie bottles it all up, and takes care of kids his wife leaves behind with him. Years later, his anger bottles up so much to the point that a dark side of him is created. Meet Hank(a.k.a. Charlie), and soon this bad dude begins to take matters into his own hands, including challenging Charlie for the affection of the lovely and endangered Irene (lovely Renee Zellweger). When her life is at risk, Irene must rely on Charlie (and Hank to save her). The chemistry between Carrey and Zellweger is so good that you cannot stop laughing. Best line from one of his sons when a corrupt cop says he didn't know their dad was crazy:"He may have advanced dillusionary schizopphrenia with involuntary narcissistic rage, but he is a very gentle person!" If you say so(laughing)!
