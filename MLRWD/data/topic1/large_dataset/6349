More than 45 years ago I walked away from the theatre after experiencing this film feeling like a wrung-out dishrag.  Viewing it was an intense and stressful emotional experience.  My over-all impression was that it compared to a typical 90 minute motion picture the way that a fine cigar compares to a cigarette butt. Today, having seen it 3 times, I'm even more impressed.  Any film must be reviewed in the context of its time.  But this one stands in a class by itself in any era.  The injustice of awarding Lee Marvin the Oscar over Rod Steiger that year was echoed later in giving Best Picture to "Shakespeare in Love" instead of "Saving Private Ryan."  "The Pawnbroker"'s flaws are small ones:  the blaring, jazzy score is a bit intrusive, for example.  Unlike watching "Citizen Kane," I am drawn into the story, unable to escape its accusations and judgements, and unable to comfort those whose trials and tortures I can barely imagine.  'Man's inhumanity to man' is a common theme, but here it goes a step further, examining what happens to the victim of the inhumanity and always whispering to the observer, "who would YOU be if this had been your experience?"  It has lost nothing in those 45+ years - can you tell it is still my favorite film?
