The service from Amazon was great; the movie arrived within a few days in perfect condition.  I actually just watched it last night (do you have a tap on my tv?) because I ordered it shortly after I viewed it on tv and decided I wanted my own copy but having just seen it thought I would wait a bit to enjoy it again.  As per the movie, I love the story; it starts the year I was born and the scenery is so nostalgic to that era.  It is a narrative movie and I like that style, as though you're viewing someone's life while they are thinking about it.  It would be too slow for anyone wanting exciting action in their viewing; it has the reality of day to day existence as it was for people just after World War II.  The theme is basically the correspondence between a woman writer in New York City and the head of a bookstore in London and their relationship developing through her search for various books not available in New York at an affordable price for her.  I can feel the years passing in their exchanges and sharing of their experiences with their friends and coworkers.  Her desire to go to England to visit is great, but always overcome by circumstance and cost.  I am quite an anglophile and thoroughly enjoyed the visual and verbal references to England.  The flow is smooth and the relationship development subtle in the movie.  Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins are wonderful in their parts and Judy Dench has an interesting supporting role as Hopkins wife. If you like plays, literary references, historical period pieces and enjoy detail and ambiance, you will like this movie. If you like Masterpiece Theatre you will like it.  If you like biographies you will probably like it.  I could watch it just for the historical detail.  I definitely recommend it.
