I am a big Charlie's Angels fans and I couldn't wait for its release on DVD. After a bit of disapointment with the season 1 box set (what a cheap packaging !!) I've been really pleased with this one, which is much, much better(though unfortunatly has no bonus :( I think that interviews of the angels, producer, or the 2000 tb show whould perfectly fit in here). The show just deserved it. The quality of the DVDs are good as is the sound. Though a lot of fans see season one with Farrah as the "real" show, I must admit that season 2 contains some of the funiest episodes (Angels on ice e.g), nad my favorites :. Cherryl Ladd does great as Jill's little sister, Jaclyn Smith is as beautifull as always, while Kate Jackson is defenitly THE STAR OF THE SHOW, the most beautifull and above all the best actress (no wonder she was the on who get nominated for Grammy's!). Some think that Farrah was the star of the show, but Kate was it, Charlie's angels survived her departure, but after Sabrina left the show just became embarassing with Shelley Hack trying to act... So, a wonderfull box set and now I am waiting for season 3.
