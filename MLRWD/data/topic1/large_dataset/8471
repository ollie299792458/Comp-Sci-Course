I have seen Mr. Skeffington several times, and each time it amazes me.  I am really amazed that the Jew's place in society is addressed at all in a Hollywood movie, let alone so truthfully. It does not blare trumpets and call great attention to itself as does Gentleman's Agreement.  As a Jew, I find Gentleman's Agreement embarrassing for that reason; I find Mr. Skeffington revelatory and truthful.  There is not one false note.

In the same manner, Mr. Skeffington deals with several other difficult and complex subjects: a marriage that has to fail because Mrs. Skeffington is very narcissistic and self-involved; in addition, she has an underlying (perhaps subconscious) mild contempt for her husband because he is Jewish.  She is also an uninvolved mother.  As her husband says, she seems unable to love, and in the movie she is obsessed with being the object of love.

There is also a lovely child whose source of unconditional love and nurturance comes almost exclusively from her father.  During her parents' divorce, she very narrowly escapes being put into the custody of her un-caring parent and is raised by her father.

In addition to the first-class screenplay, directing, casting, and acting, I am very, pleased to see Claude Rains (one of my favorite actors, and someone whom I would like to champion because he has been underrated) play totally against type, showing us a side of hims never seen in any other role (as far as I am aware).  He plays a warm, sensitive, loving and nurturing husband and--and this is the most delightful--father.  He is wonderful on screen with his daughter, and totally believable as a man with a warm, caring heart.  In all Raines's roles there has been a tremendous vulnerability, and for once, in this role the vulnerability is sensitivity, warmth, and affection, There is also courage.  It is a relief to see him shed the scabrous mantle of stunted growth, frustration, freakiness, neurosis, depravity and decadence.
