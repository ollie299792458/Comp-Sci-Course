Fatal Attraction is one 80s film that still holds up.  It is still suspenseful, still provocative and most importantly, still entertaining.  
Much of this comes from the fact that Adrian Lyne was the perfect director for this film about a lawyer (Michael Douglas) who has a regretful one-night stand when his wife is away for the weekend.  His directing is subtle, intimate and character-based (except for the Friday the 13th-type slasher ending which caters more to audience expectations rather than character motivations).  
All lead actors are well-cast, particularly the underrated Glenn Close as Alex, the troubled one-night stand who becomes increasingly psychotic.  Close plays Alex as a human, not simply a villain; a complex women with psychological problems and who is socially isolated.  
The DVD extras are excellent including the several insightful documentaries on the making of the film, but more interesting is the alternate ending.  It is easy to understand why the original ending was scrapped; it's dull and anti-climatic.  The reshot ending, aka "the bathroom confrontation" may be too violent and conventional, but it is more satisfying than the original ending.  It is the perfect example of how art and commerce collide and whether either can win in the end, or only one is the victor.  You decide.
