Fans of this movie version of John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" will be happy to find that its Special Edition transfer is quite good, on par with major DVD releases of the most recent films.  The picture quality is first-rate: color and contrast are superb, edge halos are rarely visible, and the picture depth gives the video a very film-like appearance.  The golden-hued depictions of Central California are really brought to life.  The excellent transfer will be greatly appreciated on larger screens.  The audio itself is nothing special, owing to its lower budget origins, but it is clear.
The Special Edition was made as a "flipper" disc (presumably DVD-14, which is rarely used these days): one side has the movie, and other side is devoted to special features.
"Of Mice and Men" was mostly overlooked when it was released in 1992, but Gary Sinise made a very capable adaptation (from Horton Foote's screenplay).  The highlight is an excellent performance by John Malkovich -- playing against type -- as Lennie.  The movie is very straightforward, which allows for Steinbeck's grounded observations on humanity to come to life.
