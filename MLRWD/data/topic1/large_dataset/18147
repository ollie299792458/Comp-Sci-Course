I can't give that rating on Amazon.  Anyway, as a lover of EP's music, and at the time only his music, I was so so so very hesitant to ever give a film of his the smallest chance, because of all the negative things I had heard.  I didn't want a bad film to ruin the image that the music had created in my mind.  So it was 35 years of just music, nothing else.
Then this past April 2004 I was able to make a "pilgrimage" to Memphis, specifically Graceland.  While talking with an employee in one of the giftshops, she convinced me to give certain films a try, and King Creole was the one she recommended I start with.  She was kind enough to also recommend a few that I must avoid at all costs, namely Girls, Girls, Girls.
If I could meet this Graceland employee again, I would thank her several times over. King Creole is a quality film that has an actual, and quasi-believable, plot.  It has Elvis at his most handsome, and in black and white, that comes through even more.  He gives a commendable performance, and his costars carry their weight in the film well also, esp the beautiful Carolyn Jones.
I would classify King Creole as a good overall film, and in the Elvis realm, I would consider it a great film.  I think it is his best.
