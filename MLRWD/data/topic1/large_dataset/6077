Hello folks.

I persoanlly think this is the best video game movie ever made. not that many video game movies even come close with the exception of final fantasy VII advent children.

I saw this movie in theaters back in 1995 , when I was only 9 years old. this was also during the year of Mortal Kombat 3.

the thing that made me happy was that my all time favorite kombatant , Rayden , was played very well by Christopher Lambert. rumor has it that he might return in the upcoming 2010 Mortal Kombat Movie. which would rock if that happends because Christopher Lambert is perfect for the role.

Robin Shou as Liu Kang was in deed convincing. although in the next movie it wasnt.

it was infact that this movie was inspired by notjust the 1st mortal kombat game , but the second as well. remember near the end when they go to outworld , that was in Mortal Kombat II. same as Sonya being chained up.

the one and only problem I have with this movie is that reptile had bugs for blood or something. I didnt really get that part at all. why did reptile have bugs for blood? can anyone explain it to me?

but still , I give it 5 stars. just because it brings back good memoires and still rocks to this very day.

Mortal kombat the first movie still stands as the all time greatest video game movie ever made.
