I am a person who loves old, crappy movies, such as Plan 9 from Outer Space, First Spaceship on Venus, the Creature from the Haunted Sea, etc. I can confidently say that this is the single worst movie I have ever seen (replacing the former winner, FSoV). The lead (Boone) is quite honestly the ugliest person I have ever seen. The plot was about as believable as George Bush having a sex change. After being seduced by a questionably attractive woman (who claims to be a feminist), the main character, Thrust, drills a phalus-shaped drill through the artic icecap (despite the lack of ground underneath the ice), and find a "beautiful" tropical paradise, replete with ugly "dinosaurs" (men in crappy suits, one even still bearing the original horse tail), and "pterodactyls" that I like to call Kiteodactyl...they don't flap their wings, and you can almost see the wires they hang from. I don't remember much of the plot from there on, because there wasn't much of one, but the antics of trying to catch the tyrannosaur were somewhat amusing.
And please, don't get me started on the title song.
This is the only movie I've ever regretted buying. I only gave it 1 star because there is no selection for 0 stars.
