About two thirds through this movie I completely forgot what the plot was. Somewhere when Cage is driving around Louisiana having long-winded conversations with convenience store attendants. But, it's okay because the plot is the least of this movies problems. Your suspension of disbelief is going to be working overtime. Asking yourself such questions as, "Why is smoking hot January Jones married to a 55 year old high school English teacher?" and "Why does a middle aged childless couple have alphabet kitchen magnets on their fridge?" These and other intriguing questions are waiting to be explored in this B-movie laugh fest. I don't know how much positive impact this movie will have on New Orleans tourism; my biggest take-away is that they have a lot of freeways with extremely dangerous pedestrian overpasses. On the bright side I always enjoy seeing Guy Pearce. Not a horrendous movie, just unnecessary, but good for a laugh. Whether you're chuckling at January Jones' wooden acting, or the movie's pinnacle scene at a Superdome held monster truck rally; you're sure to have two hours unbridled entertainment.
