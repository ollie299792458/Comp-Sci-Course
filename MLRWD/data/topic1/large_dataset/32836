This movie features a regression back to the simple elements of the true suspense film.  There are only simple special effects, such as that of the fog that blankets the setting of the movie.  Yhe focus in Alejandro Amenabar's film was to create suspense by using the light and dark, implementing an interesting storyline, and relying on Nicole Kidman's excellent acting of a women who is in control, but on the verge of insanity.  The pace is slow, but gripping, and when all is said and done, everything in the film comes together in a fantastic conclusion which gives a revoltuionary perspective to the paranormal world.  
Set in 1945 at the end of the war, a women awaits the arrival of her husband while looking after her two children who are photosensetive to light.  After three strange servants arrive to tend to the house, some strange things start happening.  Although it would spoil the whole movie if I were to tell you what they are, what I can tell you is that you will encounter the suspense in this movie through the movement of lights and shadows and fog and the acting of Nicole Kidman's supportng cast.  And although you will never be confused by what is taking place, you will never be sure of what to expect to come next. This is a different kind of suspense thriller with its own thrills.  This movie definately demonstrates how naieve and oblivious people are and the pain of the truth.  This DVD gives you speical insight into the movie with interviews with Nicole Kidman, director Alejandro Amenabar, and the inspiring true story of a family that is the backbone of this film.
