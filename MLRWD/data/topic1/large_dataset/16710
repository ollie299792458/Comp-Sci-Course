This is a fun movie that is based on the novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0141033746">The Prisoner of Zenda (Penguin Red Classics)</a>, in which a ruler (the President in this story) is replaced by a double to solve a sudden crisis. In the novel, the king is drugged the night before his coronation; in Dave the President has a stroke during sex with a young secretary. In both cases, the impostor is called upon to prolong the impersonation because of complications. The story is fun as Dave and the First Lady fall for each other even though she knows of his masquerade. There is a bit of dumb political nonsense about a "jobs bill" but the entire movie is fun and enjoyable. Kevin Kline is, as always, a great character actor and Sigourney Weaver plays a good foil as the First Lady who hates her husband and what he has become but is intrigued with this new side of him. Once she learns of the deception, she allies herself with Kevin Kline to try to rescue the legacy of her husband who is fatally ill. The ending is well done. I recommend it.
