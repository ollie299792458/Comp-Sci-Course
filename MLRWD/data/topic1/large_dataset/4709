I went to watch Promises at the London Film Festival in October - it opened the festival. As many have said before, Mortensen is at his best - I don't think I'm stretching out my neck too far by saying his best so far.

I found it a gripping story - beginning to end, though the pre-ending (kiss scene) was IMHO absolutely unnecessary and there are some scenes in there that were too long.

A lot was said about the steamroom fight - yes it was frightening and gripping and certainly proving a point - but my question is, why are so many (journalists, fans) focussing on that scene? - it's not Mortensen's first (full frontal nudity - The Indian Runner) and apart from that, I personally found the brothel scene (Semyon's favourite stable) more intriguing and revealing much more about Nikolai... but maybe that's just me.

All in, certainly a movie I'm going to watch again and catch more of the subtleties in it. Apart from Watts, whom I didn't find very convincing (but maybe it was the role itself)- the cast is great and next to Mortensen, Mueller-Stahl and Cassel did a fab job portraying the characters.
