My wife and I saw Ishtar in Denver when it first premiered, and were howling with laughter with tears streaming down our cheeks from the very first notes of the film.  The theatre was packed - not an empty seat in the house - and people were turning around in their seats to see who these lunatics were that were THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE THEATRE who were laughing!  To this day, I find it incredible that so few people find Ishtar to be so outrageously funny.  Thankfully, our numbers are growing.

My wife and I are both artists - she a musician and I am a creative director, so we can both appreciate what happens during collaborations and brainstorming sessions - it has been hilariously captured on film here; and cudos to Elaine May and Paul Williams for writing such brilliantly awful songs!  It is not easy to write a bad song so well.  To this day, I can start to chuckle out loud just thinking about Warren Beatty's character, Lyle on stage singing "hoopa, hoopa, hoopa, hoopa!" with Dustin Hoffman.

This movie is wonderful:  Photographed by Oscar winner Vittorio Storaro; directed by Elaine May; score by Dave Grusin; starring Warren Beatty, Dustin Hoffman, Isabelle Adjani, Jack Weston, and Charles Grodin; songs by Paul Williams, Elaine May, Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty.  And Hoffman and Beatty are playing the piano themselves.

Perhaps Elaine May went a bit overboard with her spending - a reported $5Million for the bar set alone, but this movie does not deserve the reputation it has.  Not by a long shot.  This is truly one of the funniest movies ever made!

Columbia Pictures needs to get this movie out on DVD in Widescreen for the growing number of Ishtar lovers immediately!!!!
