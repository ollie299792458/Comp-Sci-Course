Friends, one of the greatest sitcoms in the history of television and one of the most loved. Today I picked up the last box set and am now the proud owner of The One With All Ten Seasons. From the very beginning of the show's remarkable ten year run, America and the rest of the world became somewhat attached to the lives of Rachel, Ross, Chandler, Phoebe, Monica and Joey. We gladly accepted them with open arms. What a breath of fresh air the show was thanks to the talented writers, producers, directors and a cast that will never be duplicated. Not even close. As I sat and watched the start of the tenth season(again), I thought to myself, no wonder this show lasted so long. The chemistry of these six fine actors who were virtually unknown when they started this show, became household names with good reason and the stories were so well written and real. We eventually felt as if they were are old friends that would always be there for us. They were for ten years. During the run of the show, we've all had our own ups and downs, our hopes and dreams ,and grew older and learned a lot about life just as our Friends did. Those of us who were in our 20's and 30's just like our Friends were, knew or got the jokes more than others may have... But they were there to let all the others understand what it meant to be a young adult trying to start your own life(in this crazy world) along with all those obstacles that get in the way again and again. The humor in Friends was that it was okay to laugh at your own mistakes. It was okay to laugh with your friends, not at them. The love and support these characters showed and had for each other, for those of us who watched, will always be embedded in our minds. We loved Friends and now with the tenth and final season in our homes, we know that we can laugh with our Friends when we need them. We know that they will be there for us, always...
