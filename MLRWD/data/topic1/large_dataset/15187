SICK.  SICK.  SICK.

i tried to watch palm pictures' video release "time of the wolf" tonight and found myself deeply shocked and utterly sickened at what i saw.  the part of this movie which deeply offended and revolted me is the one in which a horse is brutally slaughtered on camera.  although i was not there--thankfully--i believe that what i saw in that scene was the actual slaughtering of a living creature.  the sight of the horse's eyes as the that huge knife was plunged deep into into its chest and then again when it was used to cut its throat open...and the geyser of blood that erupted from it...i cannot find the words to describe it.  this is without a doubt the most horrible thing i have ever witnessed in a movie.  please do not simply tell me that it had to be all just movie magic.  i dare you to watch that scene and then tell me that.  i've seen hundreds of movies, and i've seen animals slaughtered before, and this looked like an animal slaughter to me.  this creature had to have its throat punctured and sliced to satisfy the director's "vision"?  SICK. SICK. SICK.
