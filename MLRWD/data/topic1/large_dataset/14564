This review is for the Warner Brothers DVD released in 2005.

The movie is based on a true story.  Western cowboy Tom Horn (Steve McQueen) has a well-known reputation as fearless fighter for just causes.  The setting is circa 1901 in Wyoming and Horn rides into a small town.  After displaying his toughness in several confrontations, a local rancher named John Coble (Richard Farnsworth) hires Horn to stop a cattle-rustling problem that has been plaguing his ranch for sometime.  Horn agrees to work for him and carries out justice in his own way.  He does a great job for Coble - almost too good and then Horn is faced with a different set of problems.

The first hour of the movie is terrific with plenty of action and excitement.  It's a stunning visual presentation of Steve McQueen in a beautiful Western setting, playing a character who enforces the law his way with excitement and skill.  But then the last 35 minutes of the film is sedated and ambiguous when the story goes in a completely different direction.  Furthermore in this last segment, the character Tom Horn appears punchless and apathetic.  Since it is based on a true story, he may have really behaved this way, and that's fine, but that part of the story should have been condensed down to 3 or 5 minutes and stayed with the prior theme for a longer duration.  The film has plenty of merits, but the screen writing for the last part was poorly done and cripples the mood of the entire movie.

As for the DVD, it's a sharp and pristine widescreen color presentation. The audio is excellent.  Only two bonuses: the trailer and a `Wanted Dead or Alive' promotion.
