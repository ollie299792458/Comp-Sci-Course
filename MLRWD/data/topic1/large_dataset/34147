I am an avid watcher of Masterpiece Mystery! as are many of the other reviewers.  I won't recap the story, as it's already been told here in the reviews--but for someone who hasn't been anywhere, I loved (what I think is) the authentic sort of brogue, and I wouldn't have wanted this story Americanized and slick and edited and remastered to death;  I liked that characters LOOKED cold while they were outside, and had hair that LOOKED like they'd been rained on!

I can't stress enough how much Jason Isaacs really blew me away, and the casting really was superb.  When an actor can convey so much without a lick of dialogue or narration, well, it's a good thing indeed.  This program enthralled me and I'm looking forward to reading the book now.  I can't agree with the idea that this DVD is lacking in some way.  Any time I can watch a program and forget that I'm watching actors altogether, well I can't think it gets better than that.  I'm sorry that some folks didn't fully embrace this DVD.  I would very much like to give this to several people I know.  And to the person who thought the assistant was the only one who was funny:  there are many amusing instances in Case Histories, so you definitely missed out.
