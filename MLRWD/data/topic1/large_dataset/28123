Our parameters to define "crime" differ completely from its meaning 2 thousand years ago. Caligula and Nero, 2 emperors branded as "criminals" by the Christianity, could have been in reality an average product of these violent times.
Remember, the average Romans used to pay for the privilege of citizenship with half of their lives serving in the army and certainly dying in the war. And Rome was in war almost continuously for hundreds of years. I would indeed be surprised if all this would have not had any effect in the emperor's behavior. After all, life and death were nothing under the rule of Rome as well as another civilizations. Somehow life worth nothing even in our time of wars for resources, and I don't know if we, humankind, have learned anything from history.
War and slaughter are truly [...] and I doubt that sex is. Remember that soldier and [...] are the most ancient professions.
But coming back to this movie, I believe that most of the events shown here are true indeed. Sex, death, torture, etc were a normal currency in the Roman court as gladiator fighting and death was normal in the Coliseum's arena. Caligula added his personal "touch" to these events: the "head harvester" is so original and funny, gee, why didn't I think of this brilliant idea before? &iquest;Did Mr. Guillotin invented his device based in the harvester? I think Caligula was both mad and smart despite other opinions in contrary. Naming his horse Senator! What a brilliant way to commit his crimes unquestioned by lousy senators. I have reasons to believe that the sex and brutalities portrayed by Tinto Brass were real. And the musical score by Prokopieff reinforced the idea that Caligula's mind was indeed both smart and sick, as it was the society that he ruled.
I recommend this controversial film to everyone over 18 and with an enough open mind to make an objective evaluation about the terrible events that may have occurred thousands of years ago.
