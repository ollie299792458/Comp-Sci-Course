The best thing about documentaries is that they leave space for us to draw our own conclusions, and pick up the lessons that are best for each of us. I liked the way the camera explored the kids, teachers, parents' thoughts by making dance the central character of this movie.

It is amazing to see how these inner-Manhattan-city kids develop concentration, motivation, communication skills, commitment, respect for girls (and boys) and still have so much fun doing ballroom dancing. You just can imagine what a different world they are making for themselves and around themselves by becoming wonderful adults. In fifth grade, kids long for physical contact between genders but in most cultures, it is surrounded by mystery and taboo, driving them nuts and making the whole thing much bigger and scarier than in reality. I realized how much the physical contact through ballroom dancing can respond to that appetite in a safe environment, and let them know how much more there is still to discover than only the physical contact.

I watched the movie with my 8 year old son who got interested by the competition, picking his own team to win. He also watched it with his girl friends from school. These girls would stand up and dance watching the movie! It got me to talk to the Superintendant of his school to see if they could run a program like this. I hope it is going to work. They don't need to be inner city kids. Dance, music and joy are part of life and make them grow and look for the best in themselves.

I would recommend this movie to adults, kids, girls and boys, just for a wonderful time of fun and unconscious education of the watchers!
