The difficult part of reviewing something you love, in this case for me the movie Bright Young Things, is that one tends to have rather a lopsided view.  So, that being said, I probably do have a lopsided view, but after having watched this movie again recently, I was reminded why I enjoy it so much.

The sheer amount of cast that has gone on to bigger and better things is kind of astounding, for one.  That Stephen Fry has made a film that manages to be ridiculously over the top yet sombering at the same time is another thing.  My only quibble is in how much I cannot stand the female lead character (not the actress Emily Mortimer, she plays the character perfectly) as being paired with the male lead, but that's a characterization issue and is particular to me in part.  That being said, the acting in the film is pretty spot on, particularly James McAvoy who is riveting as the Earl of Balcairn as the character's life falls more and more apart.  The final thing that struck me as I was watching was how excessive the parties of the film are.  The 30s were simply roaring if this film is anything to go off, though that may in part be for show.

For some reason I keep coming back to this film even though I have seen it many times over.  The humor is typical Fry fair in many ways and the plotting is close enough to the original book (Vile Bodies) that one can pretty easily discern the events from the book to the film.  Mainly, this is a fun film with a slightly over the top end that manages to remain grounded even in the most overwrought circumstances thanks to the acting.  Five stars for exceeding my expectations every time I watch.
