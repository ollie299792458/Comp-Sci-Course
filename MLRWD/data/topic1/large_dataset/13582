What I mean by the title is simple, after reading the books for the first time recently, which are extremely good, I've noticed a lot of left out material from the books that's not in the movies, and Jurassic Park 3 just tries to take those left over scenes and put them into a movie and hope for the best. However the screen-writer did a very poor job, but the director "Joe Johnston" did well with that lousy script, so don't blame him, blame the screen-writer.

If you want to get the full effect of Jurassic Park, read the books. This movie itself Isn't great, and the story is really poor, so poor that the director couldn't do anything about it.

The action is pretty good, you will get pretty much non-stop action once on the island, a few "Awe-ing" scenes, and fun to watch.

The plot is poor, A kid goes parasailing with a friend of his mother's, gets stranded on Isla Sorna and his divorced parents trick Dr. Grant and his partner Billy into going on a "Tour" of the island to save their son. The son has been there for two months by himself, yea...right, and is perfectly fine.

To sum up, the movie is a poor attempt to get the missing material from the two books onto a movie, and a very poor attempt. But is fun to watch, if you don't mind a lousy plot. **/*****
