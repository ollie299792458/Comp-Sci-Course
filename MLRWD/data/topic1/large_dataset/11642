A few months ago, i rented this movie from a local Movie Gallery.  By the end of this DVD i was rolling around on the floor laughing! (nevermind the fact i was originally sitting on the floor anyway)  I brought my friend (whom hates anime and manga) over to my house and she loved it!  It is absolutely hilarious and i can't wait until I'm able to buy this and the rest of the series for myself!
  Our main character, Excel Excel, is part of an organization called ACROSS (employed: 2), which is trying to pretty much destroy the city Ef (or F, I'm not certain how it's spelled ^.^;)  in the first episode, she catches a dog (or cat?) and names it minchi (or menchi?) and carries it with her as a possible food source.  Oh, and she is in love with her Lord Ilpalazo, runner of ACROSS.
  As the series continues, we meet the next door neighbors (three men near starving because they're broke) agent Hyatt, new ACROSS agent, who has a tendency to die.  The ever adorable Puchuus, who bear a more than passing resemblance to the famous Pikachu, and many other demented characters. 
Overall, I'd say this is among the best of anime to get.
