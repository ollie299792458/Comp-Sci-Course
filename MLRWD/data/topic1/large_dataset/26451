Don't ask me why. I think a gloomy rainy day makes the movie feel spookier. I love love love this movie. I've never gotten into any of the other Poirot movies, so to me this is the one and only. I adore Albert Finney as Poirot. I know there's been some discussion about his accent, but honestly I don't know if I even know what a Belgian accent even sounds like to begin with so it doesn't bother me.

The opening scene where you see the kidnapping taking place still spooks me. Sometimes I even fast forward through it a little, just because the music creeps me out. I think the cast of this movie is brilliant. Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall, Anthony Perkins, etc. All Hollywood legends. I particularly like Vanessa Redgrave in this. She was so good at being evasive and batting her eyes at the same time. Like in the scene where Poirot is getting frustrated with her and begins yelling, I almost want to slap her. She's that good. Everyone is just fantastic in this. I really like the story itself too. Revenge, yet for a noble reason. I won't say anymore than that, though. The ending where the murder is explained is chilling. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to settle in on a cold or stormy night and just be entertained.
