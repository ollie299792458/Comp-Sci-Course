I recently ordered 3 items from Amazon.com for a friend of mine who is not online. The three DVD items, Marathon Man, The Odessa File, and Boys from Brazil, arrived at my home on time without incident. However, the Odessa file DVD was a history channel show that was NOT what I ordered. When I tried to return it (something I have never had to do before with Amazon), I encountered a loop that would not allow me to initiate return. Disgusted, I ordered the DVD once more (cost not being prohibitive), the correct one arriving this time.

My friend called me two days ago, and, after finally getting around to watching Marathon Man, discovered that it wouldn't play on his DVD player, which is a new model. The error message said that the DVD would not play in this region, which makes me think that it was made for the European (or other overseas) market. If I encounter the same nonsense I had to put up with while trying to return the Odessa File, I may decide to stop using Amazon.com for any future purchases.

What is going on at Amazon, people? I am beginning to realize where the "slightly used merchandise" available for sale on Amazon comes from . . .
