Though I had never been such a big TOP GUN fan, I have to admit that "TOP CAR" almost instantly conquered my heart when I first watched it in the early 90's and got me interested in NASCAR.
While the story maybe somewhat simple (or even hard to believe) I had always cherished the movie for its 'good vibrations' and the good mood it puts you in. Robert Duvall delivers an excellent performance as Cole Trickle's new-found father figure, the cat-and-mouse romantic tension between Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise is worth watching.
And last but not least,(my fellow countryman) Hans Zimmer delivers a score, I consider to be one of his best.

Though I started with a LaserDisc, I had always been disappointed with the original DVD release (not to mention the video authoring artefacts in the last part of the movie). The Blu-ray release - while not beeing a state-of-the-art BD - is a giant leap ahead and an invitation to experience, to re-discover the film again on Blu-ray. The improved sound design is also notable, with background noise or dialogue being much more refined than in earlier video releases.

Gentlemen - start your (home theatre) engines!
