I am an Amazon Prime member so I can stream Season 2 of Glee to my heart's content on my brilliant new Kindle Fire or my TV and what have you. But I love the show so much that I couldn't resist getting it on DVD, too.

Yes, the season has its problems...but the DVD doesn't. Honestly, sometimes I watch Glee for the actual show and characters and other times, I just need a pick-me-up with its beyond fun super karaoke. I have fast-forwarded through many shows just to watch and sing and dance along (great exercise) to my favorite numbers again and again. I highly recommend it. Episodes like Britney/Brittany and every single one featuring the Warblers make up for the flaws of this young series.

Why blu-ray? It's the new world order and the price finally fell close enough for me to the DVD version that it was worth it. I've been watching for the price for a year and waited forever for it to fall below $32 bucks. That seemed more reasonable than the high 40s though I am sure other Gleeks didn't mind paying that much for the season.
