When it comes to a movie like this sometimes you have to take the good with the bad.  The first 45 minutes of this movie was awesome, but the last 45 minutes was a downward spiral into drunk logic.  Basically the plot  revolved around two rich and sexually charged step-siblings who use their  money and natural gifts for being persuasive to mold the lives of other  young people.  The plot thickens when the challenge of taking the virginity  of a young woman who pubically vowed not to have sex until she was older  presents itself.  The acting was pretty decent and all of the stars are  beautiful young people.  Reese Witherspoon steals the show with her role  playing the virgin with the vow.  One reason this role fits her so well is  that she actually looks like a "little" girl.  This film doesn't  have any real nudity but it is quite racy and vulgar for a film about young  people....however don't get me wrong the explicit nature of the film is  actually what makes it more appealing. If you like this film, be sure to  see  ELECTION also.
