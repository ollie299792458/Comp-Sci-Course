As I watched the flawless acting and carefully crafted story pass, I kept thinking to myself, "I hope they don't ruin this with a typical Hollywood ending."  Fortunately they did not.  "The Clearing" is on the surface about the kidnapping of Robert Redford's character and its subsequent events but is in actuality about his relationship with his wife of many years, played by Helen Mirren.  We learn about their marraige a variety of ways: through conversations between Redford and his kidnapper, played by Willem Dafoe; through information the FBI uncovers as they search for Redford; and through an extraordinary meeting between Mirren and Redford's mistress.  I imagine that couples who've been married for a while and reached a certain point of stagnation will find that this movie touches areas they may not want to discover.

The story moves between two different points-of-view which are not running in parallel time.  Because of this, the writing is critical to the movie's success -- we learn important points in their necessary sequence.  The acting is near-perfect, not one of the three major characters misses any marks.  Those searching for intelligence and realistic emotion in a film will not want to miss this one.
