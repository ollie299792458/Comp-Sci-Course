Being a bit of a "true crime buff," it's always nice to see a well-constructed documentary about the life of a serial killer. Although it's impossible to reveal every little detail in a 60 minute film, writer/director John Borowski jam packs this one with tons of thoroughly-researched information.

Wonderfully narrated by Tony Jay and featuring actual photographs, newspaper articles from the time, and re-enactment footage, this docu-film really gives you a sense of the late 1800's (when these crimes took place).

The story unfolds in an engrossing fashion and keeps you intrigued for the entire 64 minutes.

I found it fascinating to learn that there were many similarities in this case to those of more modern serial killers. Sure you've heard of Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer, but have you heard of HH Holmes?  Maybe not. But Holmes was first and it's great to see Borowski pull Holmes' story from out of the basement and reshare it with the world.

This is a well-made documentary film and a must-see for true crime buffs!
