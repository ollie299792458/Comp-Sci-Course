Premiering in ABC's primetime time slot (eventually to be picked up by ALL THREE major networks and revamped and retreaded time and again over the years), the Quest team is back in their original series run! Scientist Dr. Benton Quest, armed and dangerous, ex-government bodyguard man Roger "Race" Bannon, impulsive Jonny, streetwise Hadji, and endearing to few, annoying to most Bandit, traveled the world in search of adventure. From the Arctic to Calcutta, India, the Quests tangled with pirates, aborigines, monsters, assorted evil genuises, and, on repeat ocassions, the notorious Dr. Zin.  The set does, of course, have its pros and cons.

PROS

+It's the original Jonny Quest in extended episode format (roughly 26 minutes per episode). I'm young for the initial series run but my personal favorites "Skull and Double Crossbones," "Calcutta Adventure" (Hadji's premier), "Double Danger", and "The Robot Spy" (perhaps the most famous appearance of Dr. Zin) are all here plus twenty-two more to experience for the first time.

+ For all of the cheap, underhanded edits that the execs decided it was their duty to do (if you haven't read about it yet, then I'll explain later). every gunshot, foreign-born enemy, and utterance of "sim sim salbim!" are still intact. Considering everyone who the Warner's execs could have pandered to, fans and newcomers are lucky to see this gem again at all.

+ Enough special features to effectively takedown a small army of "lizard" men, particularly the "Video Handbook" of heroes, villains, and destinations, "Fun facts/Trivia" version of "Double Danger," and vintage PF Flyers ad.

CONS

-Quest encounters and succeeds against many an antagonist situated in his own time and in many parts of the world. However, when up against a more "politically correct" (red flag, red flag!) America, the HEATHEN MON--I mean, "suits" at Warner Home Video won a few battles of their own. Having experienced "Pursuit of the PoHo" for the first time, it is obvious that Race's dialogue has been tampered with as his lips continue to flap against silence (thanks to numerous other reviewers that I read AFTER I had ordered, I know what the original dialogue was). To which I call "MOO!" (a little political correctness can get real annoying real fast, can't it)?  It's been asked at least once and it bears repeating: these episodes (untampered with) were good enough for air in their own time and even untampered with in reruns to this day. Why not for the commercial DVD market?

-The title cards didn't make it off of the cutting room floor either, instead jumping straight from the jet flight to the episode title.

-Remastering? I don't know how often the occurence is repeated throughout these volumes but, for all of the dirt and debris over the first few frames of the infamous "Pursuit of the Poho," it looks like it was "remastered" by a landfill (what is with Warner Home Video and their problem with finding suitable film material)!

-The fight sequences (to my knowledge) were left thankfully untouched but, unfortunately, so was every last sometimes painful "Bandit-stealing" scene ("Double Danger," for example, was a great episode but was filled with probably the most "Bandit" cuteness of them all). I guess we know who the Warners were pandering to but (gasp, call the ASPCA!) it wasn't to me.

-Okay, the HEATHEN MONK-- "stuffed shirts" had their reasons to toy with the content; I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for a moment. But to not properly credit Doug Wildey for his work in helping to bring this gem to the small screen (credit that the "TRIVIA AND FUN FACTS" version of Double Danger tries to give)? For shame, Warner Home Video!

For this extensive list of "cons," is this set still worth four stars? It is from me. I repeat: this was a different time and JQ '65 was made for PRIME TIME television (the adults and older kids). Hadji was an Indian who performed magic, the fight scenes were at times graphic, and practically every villain was foreign-born. It was good enough for audiences back then and audiences today are lucky to be able to experience such art ever again. But is it still "art" when the artist's finished product has been noticably tampered with and airbrushed over? In a way, I am glad to be able to experience the Quest team's original escapades; so Kudos to Warner Home Video for that. But with Jonny Quest, if you're going to give us some, give us all! And if not being "remastered" meant that the original film would have stayed untouched (dialogue intact and proper crediting applied), maybe fans would have been more better off.

I was born in the 80s and, therefore, grew up experiencing Jonny Quest for the first time as part of the "Funtastic World of Hanna Barbera" and, additionally, am waiting patiently for Warner Archive to release JQ '86. Does that make me a nonpurist? Perhaps; but JQ '86 was MY first experience with the Quests, just as the original was the first experience for many fans.
