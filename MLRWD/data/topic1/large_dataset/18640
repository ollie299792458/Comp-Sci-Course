I first saw the commercial for this upcoming release on Adult Swim and since I'm into marvel and superhuman stuff that I would check out batman, originally I had seen lots of batman movies and the batman cartoon on some cartoon channel and I enjoy anything with the Dark Knight.

Now Batman has returned in a tale that shows how he transformed from novice crime fighter and into the Dark Knight, and the action and animation are excellent here! I found this 6 part film to be really dark for what I remember of Batman. Personally I feel as if it pays good homage to the dark knight as I remember but with a darker more sinister look into him and seeing crime as it really is.

I wasn't let down and I enjoyed every minute of it, especially the speculation from the youths in the beginning of the story. the only thing I would have wanted was a real plot. Since it's reminiscent of most cartoon series in how it tells a short story in each, it didn't exactly follow a major plot throughout them all aside from a mission to mission sorta thing. All in all I still enjoyed this and recommend it to anyone whom in not a super batman freakazoid that is obsessed since some people just can't seem to enjoy it, people are too picky these days. I hope I helped someone out there, good luck with your possible future purchases.
