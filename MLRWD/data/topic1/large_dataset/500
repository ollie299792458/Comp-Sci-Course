If only every movie lived up to its title! Director Peter Jackson?s film debut is one of the most infamous if not most disgustingly fun movies ever to be released on video. An alien invasion has occurred and the inhabitants of a New Zealand town have disappeared. Luckily for mankind we have an intrepid quartet of bungling government commandos who are ready to take on the alien menace. The Alien Invasion Defense Service (AIDS?) meets up with a horde of flesh eating zombies and with a little firepower and old fashioned guts they hope to fight the aliens off before they setup a fast food restaurant featuring human happy meals. Along the way their misplaced leader Derek must try to regroup with his squad, that is unless he can keep his head altogether. The first really cool film from New Zealand is also the first movie by filmmaker Jackson who spent 4 years working on the finished product. The low budget look and excellently cheesy gore make this film the tastiest debut film since The Evil Dead and the original Night Of The Living Dead. A must see for all gore hounds but I must warn this is a really disgusting movie complete with a hideous vomit cocktail. Jackson would top this with the more outrageous Meet The Feebles and the ultimate zombie gore fest Dead Alive. Remember to watch the skies!
