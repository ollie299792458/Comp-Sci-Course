There aren't that many good teen movies out there anymore. Movies like "She's All That" and "Bring It On" are not funny, and are successful because of the teeny bopper crowd who would see "Battlefield Earth" if Freddy Prinze Jr. was in it. Among all this crap, is the two best teen comedies of this decade. "Dude, Where's my Car" and "10 things I Hate About you". This movie is the pot comedy without the pot. It is a little "Star Wars", "Who Am I" and a lot of "Half Baked". It tells the story of two "shibby"-loving dorks, Jesse(Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (The funny-as-hell Seann William Scott), trying to find out the location of their car, where they put the gifts they bought their girlfriends, and why the hell they have a lifetime supply of pudding in the fridge. Along the way, the meet an ostrich-loving frenchie (Brent Spiner), alien worshipers(led by "Queer as Folk"s Hal Sparks), and a mercedes owning playboy (Fabio). This movie does the job of spoofing bullies and snobby girlfriends in Teens ("You guys are sucky boyfriends!), creating a catchy phrase (Shibby!), and casting the most believable best friends since Bill and Ted. I know, this is from someone who would prefer Mallrats from Gladiator any day, but I love this movie with all my heart. In conclusion, a man who loves Cheech and Chong, "Spaceballs", and "Meet The Parents", should see this movie faster than you can say "...and then?"
