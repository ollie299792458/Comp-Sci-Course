This film revives the history of war resistance by veterans of the U.S. assualt on Vietnam.  There are excellent books on this movement <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4LO92">Home to War : A History of the Vietnam Veterans' Movement</a>, a movement that the war complex has tried to erase from our consciousness.  If more people were to see this film, they would begin to question their obedience to militarist narratives about the need to kill others for our "security" and "democracy" and "duty."  Our troops are not being ordered around to serve our country, they are serving corporate elites in the boardrooms of Exxon, Dow Chemical and Lockheed Martin.

Organizations like "Books for Soldiers" enable concerned citizens to send media items to U.S. troops in Iraq, Afghanistan and other outposts of the empire.  As a scene in "Sir, No Sir" reveals, there are many critically-thinking people in the military, and they need assistance in combating all the propaganda they're inundated with. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00118SUHU">War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death</a>

I saw this film on Link TV, and have purchased several copies to share with others, and donated some to a second-hand store.
