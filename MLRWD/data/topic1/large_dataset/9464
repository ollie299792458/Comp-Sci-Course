Don't be misled because this movie features Bruce Willis. Not only is it NOT the Bruce Willis you're expecting, but also this movie presents an outstanding international ensemble cast set with a background of the end of World War II. However, it is much more than "just another" WWII movie, because it deals with issues of racism in the mid-20th century, questions assumptions about that nature of veterans of the German Army, and will leave you wondering (hopefully) about how much you DON'T know about this crucial period in our nations history. A large percentage of our population doesn't even remember the Cold War, yet this film is set in a time when the USSR was our ally, and as brilliantly focused in the film, the United States PURPORTED not to distinguish between Blacks, Russians, or person's of other "ethnicity." While some Germans tried to solve the problem of multiple identities by creating one super-identity, the Aryan or Uebermensch. Great cast, highly authentic costuming, set in winter and you feel it (despite some fake snow), superb sountrack reinforces the story which has several surprising twists and turns! I would strongly recommend seeing this film in conjunction with the German-made "The Wannsee Conference" (VHS, 1984), and the recent HBO clone of that film, "Conspiracy" and read Dr. B.M. Rigg's "Hitler's Jewish Soldiers."
