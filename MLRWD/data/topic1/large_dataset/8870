Back in 1985, "To Live And Die In L.A." was an edgy, gritty police thriller much in the vein of "The French Connection". In fact, it could be said that "L.A." and "Connection" are quite similiar with both having main characters that are living on the edge and great car chase sequences. However, I believe "Connection" was the better story/screenplay.
The main difference with this film from other films of its kind is that something great happens to the main character. He's not perfect, he's not a great guy, he makes big mistakes like a real person might make. I have yet to see a law enforcement officer thriller that matches this character (played by "Manhunter" and "CSI" alumni William L. Peterson). This is what is sadly lacking in today's cop/secret service/FBI/CIA films.
The next difference, and this was good at the time but not so good now, was Wang Chung creating the soundtrack. I like Wang Chung, have all of their cds including this soundtrack. I think this soundtrack is full of great music and that it fits the film, but Friedkin overused them. Nearly every scene had some soundbite from the band and it began to grate. Well, then again, this was the era of "Miami Vice" and MTV. It was trendy then to overuse popular music in the film score. Despite this shortcoming, the music didn't spoil the film.
Lastly, Willem DaFoe and John Turturro made great bad guys who appeared fairly realistic and not superhuman like Nicholas Cage's character in "Face/Off". I agree with some of the other reviewers here that this may very well have been the last good Friedkin film. I think what he needs now is a good script--forget flimsy material like "The Hunted"!!!!
