Although I agree with the ratings given this movie, I think that a lot of reviews here have missed a few important things in the movie.  Mainly, the spirituality of the movie.  In one scene Diane is being lowered down  into the spiritual realm or unknown by her husband, holding on to the end  of the rope.  In some of the best dialouge and acting Ive ever seen in this  type of movie, Diane looks back and says "STEVEN, DONT LET  GO"!...When thinking about this scene, it really puts you IN the movie  and not just watching it.  Imagine how strong this woman was to trust her  husband to hold on to the rope that was dangling her into the unknown. Its  an extremely powerful scene. THIS WAS WHAT THE MOVIE WAS ALL ABOUT.  The  bond between the family members.  One scene immediately after this, is  when Diane gets her daughter and passed back to this world.  Its excellent,  because when they come through they are in a fetal position, and covered  with "cervical" fluid like they had been "REBORN".  After this point in the movie also, Diane and her daughter Carol-Anne have  an "air of innocence" around them.  AGAIN brilliant acting, and  direction.  Another great scene, was when Tangina was explaining to  Diane exactly WHAT was after her daughter...Tangina says "It liiiies  to her, It tells her things only a child can understand". "To her  it is only a child, but to us it is THE BEAST".  The way this scene is  acted, is incredible.  And it really displays the strength of the dialouge.  If those few things have not wetted your appetite, then I dont know  what will, Just when you watch this film, dont watch it for the special  effects, or just to rate it, GET INTO IT, AND LOOK FOR THE UNDERLYING  MEANING, IT IS EVIDENT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE MOVIE!
