Steven Spielberg translates a short story by the late Science Fiction legend Philip K. Dick to the big screen.  Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, a policeman from the Pre-Crime division of 2054 Washington, DC.  Anderton's division uses future visions of murders from three waterbound "precogs" to arrest the perps before they commit the crime.  No one can successfully commit premeditated murders anymore in the DC area without being caught, so all murders are the sudden, "act of passion" variety.  When a precog's vision shows that Anderton himself will commit the next murder, he flees, expecting a conspiratorial set-up, and the chase is on through Spielberg's version of the future, where technology is shown to be fascinating and wonderful.  The complex nature of the plot may be hard to follow and off-putting to those unaccustomed to the machinations of complex Science Fiction, but the images of the future's advertising and transportation technologies are compelling and realistic.  The film also provides an opportunity to see one of the greatest living actors, Max Von Sydow, in a bigtime Hollywood action flick.
