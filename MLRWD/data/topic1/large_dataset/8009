I see this movie is not getting very good reviews.  However, I very much enjoyed this movie.

There is no ground breaking acting or film-making here...the same formula is in place...a buddy movie of action and comedy.  I really enjoyed the first movie, but Rush Hour 2 was just a little more bland.  Rush Hour was one of the first that coupled Jackie Chan with an American star to fuse his martial arts skills with comedy.  While I am not a big fan of Chris Tucker, I found myself liking this duo.  An African-American Comedian paired together with an Asian Action Martial Arts Legend for an action/comedy worked for me.  Now on its third installment seemed on face value to be an uninteresting stretch of the original and only out to make a quick buck.  However,after watching this as a rental I bought a copy.  This movie delivered as an entertaining reworking of the formula.

This movie finds them headed to Paris to find the assassin who attempts the Chinese Ambassador's life.  We find out that Jackie Chan's character was in an orphanage and has a connection of some sort of "brotherhood" with another boy that turns to a life of crime.  Now Jackie Chan is on a mission to bring down the Triads, despite his "brother's" involvement.  Chris Tucker continues to keep things funny with his stylish dancing, singing and comedic cop blunders...Jackie Chan continues to impress with his still agile martial arts moves.

Take this movie on face value...an entertaining action comedy that puts a slightly new twist on the same formula.  If you liked the other movies, then this one will not disappoint.
