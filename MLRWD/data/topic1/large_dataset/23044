It's by now a cliche to say about a movie: "You either love it or you hate it," but I can think of no better way to nutshell American Psycho. Many people assume (myself included) that this would be a slasher flick, but nothing could be farther from the truth. Based on the Bret Easton Ellis novel of the Me Generation, Christian Bale takes us through a sometimes unsettling and always entertaing tour of the kind of self-centered vacuous yuppies that have come to be associated with the eighties. Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a soulless, opulent man who kills indiscriminantly, hates everyone, and finds his only source of joy in pop music, his reviews of which pop up frequently throughout the movie. The plot hinges on one fact: because Bateman looks so successful, he can get away with anything, even though he may not want to. The self-loathing but carefully preened focus of the movie is actually one of only two characters, the other being his assistant Chloe Sevigny.
A strange movie, to be sure. The ending may leave you confused but you won't forget it for a long time to come, whether out of love or out of hate.
