This is the stupidest movie I have ever seen(or even thought of). As other reviewers said, the only bright side of this movie is that it has Denzel Washington(Lincoln Rhyme) in it. Regardless of the the performances, the  plot is very insane. If you are a guy with a brain you'll be finally find  yourself that you've been on the bad guys side alone the movie. It's an  insult to love and intelligence.
  Angelina Jolie stars as an officer,  Amelia Dinaghy, who works with kids. She got in the story since she  discovered a dead body buried near the railroad tracks. She took all the  photographed all the evidence very smartly and rightly. Rhyme's(Denzel  Washington) impressed with her doings and since he is crippled(because of  the accident in the beginning of the movie) he decides to abandand all his  old buddy coworders and forced Amelia to asist him on this case. They work  as a good pair, Rhyme gives commands and Amelia finishes them. Although  they work very hard but still the killer has his victims lined up. The cops  can't stop the killer, they can only follow the evidences which are  intentionally left by the killer. Finally there is only about 15 mins left  in the movie and the good guys still don't have any clue to capture the  killer so the director decided to let the killer turn himself in but not  tragically but stupidly.
  After the movie I really felt the killer was  the only smart one and the cops plus all the other officials including  Rhyme and Amelia were all pethetic. The crime was solved not by those who  tried to solve it but by the criminals themselves(because they suddenly  became insane as the director told them to).
