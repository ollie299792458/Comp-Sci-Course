This DVD is simply the best concert DVD I've purchased. A great performer, at the absolute top of his game, with a super-tight rock-solid backup band, Scaggs recorded this in an intimate venue, with crystal clear sound and high definition video. THIS is what a music DVD should be all about.

Boz Scaggs is a performer who simply refuses to rest on his laurels. A quarter century after turning pop music on its ear with his ground-breaking "Silk Degrees," Scaggs is still evolving and improving as a singer, guitarist, and writer. His recent album "Dig" is one of the best pop albums of the last decade.

Most of the classic hits are here. Unlike so many performers who perform their old hits almost apologetically and listlessly, Scaggs (and his band) deliver a sound that captures the original complex licks and grooves to perfection, yet also succeeds in bringing something new and exciting. If anything, these renditions are better than the originals. Scaggs sings with better control, depth, and clarity now than he did 20 years ago. In an era of quick-buck copouts, his professionalism and artistry are a revelation.

After viewing this, I went out and immediately bought 3 more copies for friends. This is something I have never, ever done before with a DVD.

If you care about true craftsmanship, and want to see a near perfect performance, perfectly recorded, BUY THIS DVD!!
