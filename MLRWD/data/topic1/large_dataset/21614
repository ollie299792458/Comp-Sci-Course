"Give it a name". . . Seems that's ALL they gave it. The title is great! Now, let's see... Um, it looks pretty. If it were a painting it would be okay to hang in your den. It sounds good. If it were a song it could make the top ten for a week, maybe. As a movie, it's complete hackneyed trash. If you like action, comedy, character, style, dialogue or plot, do not see this movie. Ya know how you're supposed to care about what happens to a character when you sit down to watch a movie? Good luck here. These guys are not good guys with a bad attitude, not bad guys who have a reason for being bad. They are boring losers who think they are cool because they speak in slang and have a secret handshake. I'm convinced that the people who like this movie have been tricked into thinking that this movie is part of the new cool. They want to compare it to 'The Usual Suspects'. Excuse me, but that movie had a thing called plot. They want to compare it to Tarantino. His flicks are not cool because of style, obscenity or violence. They are cool because they give us characters who we care about--even though they are all shmucks. They are us in every way. (...). I'd rather have those 20 minutes than have to sit through this waste of time again.
