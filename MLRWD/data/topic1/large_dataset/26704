This movie really shows what an excellent singer and actress Judy Garland is.  And what a great actor Gene Kelly is as well.  They both make our modern actors seem rather flat and expressionless.  The story centers around Gene Kelly convincing Judy Garland to join up with his vaudeville gig and leave the one she is currently with.  Naturally, they fall in love, although there are quite a few hurdles to overcome.  One of the highlights of the movie is actually the singing of a character named Eve Minard, a fabulous Opera singer.  Her voice is phenomenal.  George Murphy is quite the gallant character who is also in love with Judy, but backs out graciously.  I personally was hoping Judy's character would choose him, but I'm not the screen writer.  The movie starts off fabulously and is very entertaining with lots of fun songs and dances.  About midway through it turns into a WWII propaganda film, even though it is set in WWI.  These are hard to escape in this era, and they are hard to sit through.  Not that the message isn't relevant, but it is so overdone and before the disillusionments of Vietnam and so forth, that they are a hard pill to swallow.  Nontheless, the film is enjoyable.
