Is this movie a comedy for mystery fans, or a mystery for comedy fans?  Whatever your tastes, this is a delightful spoof of the old gumshoe classics of the thirties and forties. Poirot, Marple, Chan, Spade, and the Charles' (Thin Man series) are all lampooned by a (pardon my caps) ALL-STAR CAST that is amazing by any standard.  It's hard to say which performer was having the most fun.  I'd give it five stars, but I recognize that the subject may have limited appeal for younger audiences who would have a hard time anchoring the farcical characters to their famous literary forebears.  The writing is a hoot with many laugh-out-loud moments, but I think I enjoy it more because I appreciate the satire and not just the sight gags.  Honestly, I put this one on my short list of lesser-known gems.  How wonderful that it's still available for purchase.

The plot centers around a dinner party hosted by an eccentric (aren't they all) mystery host who plans stage a murder so that he can outsmart the world's greatest detectives.  The guest list includes (in alphabetical order) Eileen Brennan (Tess Skeffington), Truman Capote (Lionel Twain), James Coco (Milo Perrier), James Cromwell (Marcel), Peter Falk (Sam Diamond), Alec Guinness (Bensonmum), Elsa Lanchester (Jessica Marbles),  Richard Narita (Willie Wang), David Niven (Dick Charleston), Peter Sellers (Sidney Wang), Maggie Smith (Dora Charleston), Nancy Walker (Maid), and Estelle Winwood (Nurse).  How could you not be delighted by such a cast?

If you liked Clue, the film version of the famous board game you'll probably find Murder By Death somewhat familiar, but every bit as enjoyable.
