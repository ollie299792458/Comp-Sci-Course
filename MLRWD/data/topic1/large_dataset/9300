The 3 good things  are that it's a thinker's movie.  The excellent special effects.  And the plot kicks arse.  The one bad thing is that Keanu is in it and I'm not prepared to admit that, yes he is a good phsyco.  He is supposidly a bad actor but he can also play a good Christ character in Matrix and a good lawyer in Devil's Advocate.  And he is awful at acting but can play these roles well, and they're diverse roles. There are same major things that you need to realize when you watch this movie.  I came in giving it 2 stars, but after seeing it I loved it.  My mom hated (3 weeks before I saw it) it until I told her this information: James Spader's lover that got killed by Keanu was an affair he was having.  This is the only woman he has loved.  Reeves is the only connection to the woman DONT READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET and he can't kill him because of that. The picture they flash up on the screen for Jane Doe 3 at the end wasn't of Mira Sorvino, but of the woman who Spader had an affair with.  And that's how he knew to go the grave.  It was cool touch. Spader had been living in the past.  That's why spader couldn't kill Reeves.  The flashbacks stopped when he was put at the cross-road in his life: continue to live in the past or live in the future.  When he saw the wire to her neck he knew that he had to move on. Great job!!!
