I never would have chosen this movie.  I'm not a Julia Stiles fan (too pouty) and I'm not a "dance movie" enthusiast.  In this case, I was just a dad indulging his daughter.  We sat down to watch this video together and I prepared for the worst.  (I'll make no reference to Flashdance.)
I was very pleasantly surprised.  In my eyes, the story line is classic Romeo/Juliet, forbidden love, society just won't leave the young lovers alone material.  While there was a lot of visually pleasing dance footage it was clear that the movie was not about dancing.  There are a number of interesting subplots, but none are contrived and all of them work to support the main theme.  All of the actors turned in excellent performances.  I commend Julia Stiles for a steady performance that kept the character believable.  Sean Patrick Thomas also delivers a very believable performance.  Fredo Starr is the perfect ghetto-trapped, trying to make the best of it, hoodlum, and Terry Kinney's performance as "Dad" makes all of us Dads happy.
This movie turned out to be perfect.  I enjoyed watching it, but, more importantly, my daughter loves it.  The movie delivers a thought provoking plot with wisdom and sincerity.  I'll watch for other movies under Thomas Carter's direction.
For all those reasons, I give Save the Last Dance a hearty thumbs-up from Dad.
