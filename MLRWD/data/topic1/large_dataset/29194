"Blair Witch II: Book of Shadows" is a stylish clever horror flick, unjustly dissed. The film opens on a high note, mocking the commercialization of the first film, and its more obsessed devotees. I thought that it was a very daring, clever move especially since we, the devotees of the first film, added to its great profit and success.
Like many other recent flicks, this one leaves it upon you, the viewer to try to make sense of the events you are shown. And what bizarre things we do see-an owl crashes through the exfactory window, Trista turns around on her bed, the camera records events that none can remember...
The characters in this film are all interesting, but not easy to understand. I especially liked the gothic type girl. 
Ultimately this fast paced film will leave you with more questions than answers, as you ponder the following: 1. The gothic/psychic girl has a momentary vision of Jeffrey in an electric chair-is he the reincarnation of the serial killer in the first film? 2. Is the Blair Witch even involved in the events that transpire? 3. Has Mass Hysteria indeed grasped the group? 4. Why does the group have no memory of those five hours? Pay Very close attention to the drunken scenes early in the film, and the possible hypothesis's served up. I think the key to drawing your own conclusions to this film lies there, if anywhere.
Sure the film is gory, but luckily most of it is kind of dreamlike rather than in your face gore. I would highly recommend this film if you can appreciate a film for the artistic visual impact alone, and if your ok with drawing your own answers. A winner on all counts.
