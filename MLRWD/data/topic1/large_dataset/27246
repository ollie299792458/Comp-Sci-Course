First of all, in response to the editorialized review above, the reason why Princess Kida did not know how to read her language is because she was only a TODDLER when Atlantis sank. I can remember bits and pieces from when I was a little girl, such as trips my family took or random little incidents here and there, but come on! Unless you're a child prodigy, you don't read at age four! Second, the crew didn't know that Atlanteans lived for centuries BEFORE they found Atlantis because (duh) incredibly little is known today about the society itself, or whether or not it even exists. They obviously LEARNED about it seiing as the king is 20,000 years old and still kicking! Sigh. Lastly, PLEASE get off Atlantis for stealing Nadia. I'd never even HEARD of Nadia until this whole stupid controversy came up, and several magazine investigations proved that the Disney animators and production team hadn't, either. I'm not going to say that Atlantis is perfect. Goodness knows that the animation, for the most part, was a disgrace to the Disney name, with the squared edges and all. And of course it borrows bits and pieces from other things, but it is physically impossible not to have ANY similarities with other movies. You could just as easily accuse them of stealing The Road to El Dorado (ehich is probably more plausible because it is more recent and more well-publicized than Nadia) or Star Trek! I guess what I'm saying is, take those reviews with a grain of salt. If you like sci-fi/fantasy or you like animation, then see Atlantis. I didn't think I'd like it, but it's now my favorite movie, so don't let rumors discourage you from seeing what is in itself A GOOD MOVIE.
