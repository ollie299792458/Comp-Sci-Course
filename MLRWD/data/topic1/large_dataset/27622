I am not a country and western fan.  Have always felt the monotone twang, and 4 note limit-range octaves pretty dreary -- and to have lasted so long in America, at the expense of other previous music, is plain astonishing.  But if this is country, I'm ready to go with it.

The film, if it has flaws, is that I really could have used about two more script pages of "explaining" what the heck is going on!  As it goes, we get only bits and pieces.  Not all the characters motives are clearly outlined or defined.  And that is where it could have been so much better.  Yet the unraveling slices we see, are a range of such depth and complexity, it sometimes/always keeps you wondering.  And wanting more.

But for the characters in it, this has to be an all-round bravado set of performances.  Miss Paltrow, as sharp and crisp, as I've never seen her before; Tim McGraw an absolute presence of solid restraint, and final vulnerablity... with Garrett Hedlund stealing the show (with an ambiguous sort of character, you can't figure what drives him, or where he wants to go, or even why -- ), with a charm that is irresistable, and a voice (even McGraw has said) is wondrous. And let's not forget Leighton Meester, who can sing, and developes into a real darling... yet still doesn't hold the bottom of the basket together.

With what we have, weaknesses and all, I give it 4 1/2 stars.  The range and scope of complexities presented,and carried through -- had it gone further, we might have hit a ten on this one.  The music and performances were terrific.  But some of you... like to grumble about anything.  Too bad you missed the real qualities of the whole.
