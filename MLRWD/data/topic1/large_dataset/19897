If you're looking for a comedy full of gross out gag humor stop reading this review now and go rent Meet the Fockers of Eurotrip (both mindless studio drivel churned out to make $$$).  As to the reviewer who said this isn't a deep movie, you're an idiot.  I'm sorry, but if you can't find something deep about this movie you have some sort of emotional void that nothing will fill.  I found myself connecting with the characters on a very deep and personal level.  If you're interested in watching a moving drama about people and their development rent In Good Company.  It's reminescent of American Beauty, but has a happier ending.  The characters are developed amazingly as we watch a father of a loving family cope with his new baby on the way, and his work situation.  On the flipside is a young hotshot who seems to have it all figured out.  Topher's character has a wife, a nice house, a fat salary with a booming corporation, and a new porsche.  Quaid's character has 2 great daughters, a loving wife and a newborn on the way.  Both seemingly have it made.  Then the hardships follow as they both realize their life isn't quite as secure as they thought it was.  Without spoiling the movie, they both learn something about each other.  The amazing thing about this movie is as despiseable as Topher's character is in the opening scenes, we find ourselves feeling empathy for him on the same levels as we initially did for Quaid's character.  The movie just works.  The chemistry between the actors is perfect and it shows.  It's hard to put your finger on, but this movie just works. Period.  It's one of those movies that gives you those deep emotional chills throughout.  Without saying more, Just see this movie.  You won't be dissapointed.
