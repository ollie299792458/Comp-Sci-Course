I definetely recommend the DVD Dumb and Dumber for anybody to buy.  No matter what age is viewer is, this comedy is hilarious.  It is about two men who search for a woman because she left her briefcase in the airport, little do they know that they have gotten themselves in the middle of some risky business.  They are totally oblivious to what they have done and continue on their journey the whole time.  It is hilarious because the two of them are very unintelligent and have no clue what they are doing.

  This movie is great to watch over and over again, and everybody will like it.  I would say it is one of the best comedies of all time, and usually rates at the top of everybodys lists.  It is the best comedy I have ever seen, and I myself own it.  This movie will keep you laughing and entertained throughout the whole movie, and will put you in a good mood afterwards.  I strongly recommend this movie to anybody, especially if they enjoy comedies.  It is a great movie for anyone, anywhere at any time.  If you are looking for a movie to buy that you are sure you will like, look no further.
