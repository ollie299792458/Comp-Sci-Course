....Could Hardly Wait For The Credits.  I don't usually write movie reviews, but people gotta be warned here.  I saw this ages ago, and it left just a vague impression.  Decided to order it and view again, as Nicholson is one of my favorites.  I could not sympathize with any of the characters in this movie.  The actors and actresses never seemed to drop into their roles at all.  The sets and backdrops were just too phony and ordinary, and the themes and places portrayed should have come across much more raw and gritty.  The acting was sub-par and the dialogue was contrived and predictable.  Nicholson couldn't even save this flick for me.  Streep acted like a paper sack in this one.  The recurring ghosts were just annoying and the family reunion scene made me ache is was so lousy.  If you wanna see a real drama about destitute and homeless people, get Barfly.  If you wanna see Nicholson is an unforgettable role, get The Last Detail, One Flew Over..., or even Goin' South.  Streep shined much brighter in Silkwood and Sophie's Choice.  This one was a mess.  Sorry-don't blow your $$$ on Ironweed.  Two stars are for some effective flashback sequenses and Streep singing in the bar (only scene in movie that moved me at all).  Notice when Nicholson, as a youth, hits the guy with whatever he threw during the strike.  The projectile never came close to hitting the guy, and the man who (supposedly) got struck covered his face and fell backwards before anything even got near him.  Simply pathetic.
