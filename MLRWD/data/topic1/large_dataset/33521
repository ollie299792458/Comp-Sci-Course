A tight thriller, and well worth checking out. However...
the central premise is decidedly flawed as are some of the
convoluted explanations to the mysteries that surround our
hero. These explanations are wholly unsatisfactory, as much
as the denouement; in sum, they are quite unbelievable.
This reviewer is not familiar with the novel, but it beggars
belief that the author would echo Chandler and be unsure as
to who killed who and why.
And on that note: why was the hero's wife's best friend killed?
How did the rich-man-in-the-big-house know when to have the hero's
computer hacked? How come the bent cop who was supposedly so
good at being bent not cover up the murder of the rich-man-in-
the-big-house's son? How could the wife pretend to be dead for so
long and live with herself for the grief it caused?
Actually, I really can't be bothered working it out, find out
for yourself..but don't tell anyone, you never know who's watching!
