Having been a U2 fan since Boy, the '79-'83 period for me is what U2 is all about..and this dvd sums it all up..I started to lose interest w/ Unforgettable Fire in '84 (although "Wire" is one of my fave U2 songs) and now have zero interest from anything past Rattle and Hum.  I am a fan of a certain period of U2 plain and simple..

..That said, The Red Rocks dvd is essential for the fans of this specific post punk-Stiff Little Fingers-influenced U2 period (some of you may not have a clue to what I'm on about)...

Their 1983 performance here is astounding and truly sincere, I forgot how exciting they were live..tons of balls, way better than the vhs I have of them supporting SLF in Belfast in 1980. The dvd mix is big with alot of punch...the video to me is excellent...shot in 1983 remember. Tube cameras = those squiggly lines....if you have a problem w/ non-digital film then this is not for you and your $12M entertainment center, it sounds and looks amazing on my $13M system.

...Also regarding Electric Co....I don't put U2 on a pedestal...I've been w/ them since day one and I love their 1st 3 LPs and early 7"s...to me they're one of many great (Euro) punk influenced bands of that dark/edgy period along w/ Magazine, Echo and the Bunnymen, Killing Joke, etc.. If your world is based around the 'iconic' hero-worship image of Bono climbing to sing Send in the Clowns then do not get this..I personally prefer this edit, could care less, would rather hear the song uninterrupted and see the band kicking @$$ instead, they did a great editing job, not a problem to me..but what do I know....

Overall the Red Rocks dvd documents the end of an era for U2...young and hungry post punk out...80's self importance fluff in...If this was the performance I saw in '85 then the Red Rockers would not have blown them away that night, probably the reason the Red Rockers were replaced as support that tour w/ Lone Justice!!!....get this dvd!
