If you look back into ghost stories in film history, a few major ones will really stick out. Poltergeist, The Amityville Horror, The Exorcist, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, The Ring, The Grudge...The Haunting in Connecticut attempts to tell a supposedly true story, in a fashion that will probably remind you of The Amityville Horror, but it really fails to capitalize on the fear that a good ghost story should instigate.

The beginning of the film starts off strong and interesting, and VERY creepy, with the filmmakers utilizing the technique of not showing you actually what's going on. One of the scariest moments in the film  happens in the beginning, when the mother is doing the laundry or something, and she hears someone walking upstairs. Subtle things like this really help bring the fear. Other moments, like short glimpses of ghosts in mirrors and things like that also builds the fear...but soon after that, everything goes down hill.

The plot really doesn't evolve into much of anything. There isn't a big plot twist or sudden realization at the end. There's no cliffhanger ending to leave you grasping for more, and there's really nothing that will keep you very interesting in what's going on. In fact, you will be bored of the plot shortly before the climax, though the climax does admittedly throw some excitement into the mix.

The special effects were well done, though they over-do the ghosts towards the end and the plot isn't really all that interesting. Still, it's worth a couple of scares towards the beginning, but it's definitely not going to maintain cult status like the films mentioned at the beginning of this review will.
