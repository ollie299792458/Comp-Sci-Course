In ways this is an old chestnut; but it has its charms.

It's beautifully cinemagraphed: the colours are rich and vibrant.  The natural scenery is wonderful.  Plus, the beginning of the film is a splendid evocation of American Victorianism--with the funeral parlor, court house, boarding house, etc.

The representation of post-bellum middle-southern America is excellently drawn.  (The locale is supposed to be Arkansas.  There is mention of Yankees and Texicans, etc.)

Glenn Campbell was not an actor at all, but he was a good fellow and a nice folk singer of the 1960s, closely identified with Texas.  (He sings the title song.)
Great supporting cast with Robert Duval and Jeff Corey.  The two scenes with Strother Martin are worth the price of admission alone.  Probably this is John Wayne's best r√¥le.

The sound track score by Elmer Bernstein is very fine; and as mentioned, the scenic cinematography is excellent.  The screenplay dialogue is wonderful, featuring real Americana turns of phrase.  The widescreen DVD transfer is good.

Finally, there is an ineffably life-affirming ambience to this film which is touching and uplifting.  At the end, when Rooster jumps the rail on his new horse, it brings a tear of joy.

Edit 25 Dec. 2010: having now seen the Coen Brothers' new film of True Grit we are happy to report it a very good work indeed, and a fine successor to the 1969 version; hopefully it will bring this story of courage, righteousness and justice to a new generation of viewers.
The new film is dark and elegiac, striking a deep resonant chord of genuine Americana: highly recommended.
