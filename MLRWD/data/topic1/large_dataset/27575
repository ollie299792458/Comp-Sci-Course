Consider this trilogy a quantum leap in the treatment of the traditionally two-dimensional action genre.  Flashy pyrotechnics are eschewed in favor of razor-sharp, grimly vivid fight scenes and chase sequences.  The entire series is a profound success and - hopefully - will raise the bar for future filmmakers.

Each film is completely self-contained, but fans are rewarded by the story arc spanning all three movies - plot threads introduced in the first film are thoroughly resolved in the final installment, yet the series avoid pat answers.  The sense of solitude, of isolation increases gradually over the course of the films, so that the protagonist's tenuous connection to humanity bends and wavers.

Any qualms about Matt Damon in the title role were dispelled immediately in the first film.  He brings a gravitas to the role that has been unseen in his previous work, and renders Jason Bourne both forgivable and unforgiving.  Balancing on  a fine line, he resists high drama and scene-chewing in favor of a haunted, gritty determination.

The supporting cast is, to a one, superb.  Franka Potente is refreshingly unpolished and unpackaged; a rarity lately.  Chris Cooper is excellent in a role that could easily have been cardboard villainy, and he's followed by fantastic character actors Brian Cox (in The Bourne Supremacy and David Strathairn (in The Bourne Ultimatum).  Pamela Landy, played by Joan Allen, is a complex adversary for Bourne as he avenges past wrongs and attempts to unravel his past.

It's difficult to recommend this series highly enough - the combined, fully committed efforts of all those involved have created a set of films that's unique and flawlessly executed.
