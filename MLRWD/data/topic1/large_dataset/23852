I was extremely excited when I saw this live right here in Chicago, Illinois, this being my first ever PPV live in person. I have to say I was somewhat disappointed. Taking place during the same month of WresleMania X-7, I knew the guys behind the scenes might try and rush things to culminate on the procedding PPV. The WWF was 3 for 3 on great PPVs when WrestleMania turned out to be an outstanding PPV and in my opinion probably the greatest WrestleMania yet. I was getting excited when they started booking the matches especially the main event with all the major titles on the line. There were only 3 matches I thought were good, but not exciting. Those included the main event, the triple threat European title match, and the Last Man Standing match involving Shane McMahon jumping off over 50 feet off the entrance structure. The Angle/Benoit match could have been better. What in the world was that Dutchess of Queensbury match thing all about? To sum it up, the event could have been a lot better, but I'm not pointing fingers at anyone. Who could blame the WWF for putting on 3 tremendous PPVs in a row before this one? As for the DVD extras, all you get are 2 matches from Sunday Night Heat that are probably less than 10 minutes each and interviews and segments that you already get before each match. I bought this just for the sake of knowing I was there but I probably wouldn't recommend buying this.
