When you first begin watching this movie, you may be thinking this isn't going to be a very good movie or this isn't your kind of movie, that's what I thought at first. You've got to give it a chance though, it's slow to start but eventually becomes an edge of your seat thrilling mystery. The acting in the movie is great, normally the movies with a lot of stars aren't well put together and the acting looks bad but not in this movie. This movie was well written and well played out. It was interesting to learn upon watching the special features this movie was written partially by Billy Bob Thorton. This movie brings out the best in some actors and actresses, specifically Keanu Reeves.

Don't let the certain terms used to describe this movie fool you into thinking this is just a horror movie or movie about some tarrot card reader because it's far more than that and the story goes much deeper.

Last but not least there is an added bonus for us guys, particulary the guys who like beatiful & sexy women and that would be the topless scene with Katie Holmes.

Overall I give the movie an A.
