A one star rating is way too high for this, but to avoid being ambiguous, this is the highest honor I can give to this attempt at a bad movie.

These are tragic times indeed when a film like this is considered "a metaphysical treatise".

I normally only bother writing reviews for things I like, I actually want to help others get good movies or books (and appreaciate others who do the same).

But having attempted about 2/3rd's of this film, I was deeply saddened to see such garbage being so highly praised!

There is nothing deep here, just a very bad "postmodern" story trying to be complicated and profound when in reality, it is paper thin dumb.

There is a point in the movie, in which the plot intersections are trying to be explained, (this was about the same time when I decided that I rather watch "The Matrix" again, than stick to this non-sense) in which we find the main character talking to a friend. She says something along the lines of "You are a 9, a 10 is God, and you are not THAT powerful" "What are you?" he then asks. "We are 7's, just ordinary people (meaning having no special powers)". The Dialoge contnues: "Who (or what) are 8's then?" She replies "Koalas, they have the ability to alter time", or something like that. And it is quite literally along such lines that such profundities go in this film.

If you consider looking at meaningless patterns and find new age philosophy and bad drug alterations in perception to be intellectual and deeply metaphysical, then this is for you.

Otherwise, do yourself a favor and watch "Sex and the City", at least you find out how hollow women go about in life.
