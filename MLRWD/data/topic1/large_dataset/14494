Mann has taken some of the characters and incidents from Cooper's novel and woven an entirely new tale from the material. The film is more closely related to today's popular romance paperbacks rather than Cooper's adventure novel. The film is about one young woman's discovery of true love; this is the stuff of romance paperbacks - not adventure novels of the early 19th century. This film is not an adaptation of Cooper's novel but something entirely different.

It is important to note here that Cooper did not create a love life for Hawkeye in any of the five novels he wrote about the frontiersman. The Hawkeye-Cora Munro love story of the film is Mann's fabrication.

The performers, the music, the details of costuming are wonderful - but the film is a far cry from Cooper's novel and historical accuracy. Nonetheless, it's a fun film and recommended for viewing. Just don't take it too seriously. Read the book!

Historical background: 2,000+ persons left Fort William Henry for Fort Edward on the morning of August 10, 1757 when the British surrendered Fort William Henry to the French. The French typically paid their Indian allies with the plunder of the defeated but with the British surrender of the Fort, the Indians were deprived of their "pay." The massacre began when Indians began to seize the possesssions of the departing British soldiers and civilians. Those who resisted the plundering were murdered. It was estimated then (and believed so now) that 70-150 persons died in the mayhem. Colonel Munro survived and made his way to Fort Edward with 500 persons. Hundreds more straggled into Fort Edward over the following days. The French risked their lives to stop the massacre and accompanied the survivors to Fort Edward.
