I watch these dvd's all of the time and to the fan that has been waiting for years for them to come out in this format it is great. I honestly don't know what all of the complaining is about. Would it have been good if we could get all uncut episodes, yes but then again not even on tv -here in NY they run at 2:00am - can  you watch an uncut episode. I used to watch this show as a kid on channel 11 and frankly there is not that much that has been cut off that I can remember.  So if you love the Odd Couple and want to see them again, please buy these dvd's. The edits are in my opinion a minor inconvenience.  I have bought all four seasons and I hope to buy the fifth when it comes out. Season four is probably the best season of the Odd Couple the great comedic timing of Klugman and Randall should not be missed and I hope that these dvd's create a new generation of fans. The Odd Couple was one of my favorite shows as a kid and it is great to see them again.  Oh, and regardless of what another reviewer says here; the "fusilage" line from the Flying Felix episode is on this dvd.
