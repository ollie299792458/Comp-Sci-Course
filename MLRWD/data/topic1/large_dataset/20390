As one of my favorite films of all time, I was crushed to have to give this release four stars.  I had high hopes for a Disney release, and the one bonus is the anamorphic (widescreen) presentation.  The trouble is with the re-recorded dialogue.  A cast of stars (Dakota Fanning, etc.) lend their voices, but the charm and spark is lessened.  In particular Mei's voice and vocabulary (the youngest girl) is no longer that of a toddler.  For example, earlier releases translated her discovery of tadpoles in a stream as a verbal struggle, saying "golly-pollywogs!".  In this release she just says "Tadpoles!".  Endearing touches like that make the Troma translation clearly a work of love.  Disney's translation is perhaps more literally correct, but colder and more corporate for it.

Update: Now that my 2.5 year old daughter has seen it several times (and become addicted) I feel I should temper my review.  If SHE finds the spark in it, perhaps it simply is different from my expectations.  I still believe a younger voice for Mai would be ideal, but now I'm just being picky.
