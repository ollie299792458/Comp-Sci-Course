An excellent beginning to Tom Baker's last season, noted for a more serious approach to story, character and production design.  The parallel track commentary by script editor Chris Bidmead, actress Lalla Ward and director Lovett Bickford is interesting precisely because their roles on the program were so functionally different.  Between them you have the basic elements of drama.

Doctor Who stories aren't often inspired by science, but it's entertaining here to see the theoretical tachyon applied to a "practical problem" - that is, making people (or beings) younger or older.  Science-grounded fiction is a rare creature to find on TV. There was a good series called "Space Island One" out a few years ago, but I bet you haven't heard of it.

  I've recently read in a technical news digest that scientists are being trained as TV and movie scriptwriters in order to dramatize science for young viewers, to get them to consider scientific careers.  From Doctor Who, this story and "Logopolis" present entertaining science-based fiction.
