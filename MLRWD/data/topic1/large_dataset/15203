Ever since I can remember, Christmas hasn't been Christmas without at least one viewing of this film.  Even waaaay back to the days before VCRs and 300 cable channels, living in a small Arkansas town, my brother and I would scour the TV guide that came in the Sunday paper to see if it was coming on one of the three channels we got.  (How did we survive?)

I also have the 2002 disc, and comparing them on my setup it's obvious that alot of care has gone into the restoration efforts.  However (here comes the nit-pick)...watch the scene where the door to Scrooge's sitting room flies open in advance of Marley's entrance.  Scrooge leaps up from his chair and cowers against the wall...his mouth is opening BUT YOU CAN'T HEAR HIM UTTER HIS CRY OF FEAR!  This, to me, is shoddy audio engineering...since of course it's loud and clear on the 2002 version.  Someone apparently dropped the audio out when the transfer was being done.  Yes, I know this is a very, very minor point, but it's still a point.  So I actually give the disc creators 4 stars.  If they were as dedicated to the full restoration of this film as the packaging would have us believe, they wouldn't have missed something so trivial.
