I first heard of Tom Shadyac's amazing personal journey on the Oprah Winfrey Show, and then after watching the documentary on the Oprah Winfrey Network I knew it would be something I wanted to purchase and watch again.

What struck me the most about I AM is that it helps us all to stop and think about what is really important to us and more importantly why it is important. For Tom he was living a world that so many of us would love to be a part of, but he realized after a tragic incident that it really didn't make him the real person that he is. What happened next was a conscious decision to find out who he was, why he was here and what he could really do to make the world a better place.

I AM is an obvious biblical reference to God explaining who He is, and I think it is an appropriate title for this film because we are asked to evaluate who we are and why we are the way we appear to be. Tom's changes in his life might seem to some extreme, but the idea of celebrity and all of the trappings that come from it can be just as extreme. There is absolutely nothing wrong with success. It's what you do with that platform and how you use what you have to make the world around you a better place that really makes you shine.

It's not easy to just appreciate the little things, but Tom helped me to see that in the end that is all we really have. All that we are building has the potential to be destroyed, and what will be left? If we are not living authentically we will be lost along with everything else.

I AM gets to the heart of what is really important, and that is why it is something all of us should take the time out to consider.
