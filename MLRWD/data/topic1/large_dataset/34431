I've heard a lot about this movie from family & friends. They were right: The country/action does feel like the grimy, humor-infused subreality we'd heard described by our own ancestors, & those writing about things Irish. The musicality is top-notch, even more so as it's performed by genuine relative unknowns of Dublin. It does have a decent plot, with a real vs. Cinderella candy ending, and absolutely rockin! music.
It has taken over two weeks to stop singing "Chain of Fools'- I love that song anyway, but the honest new life given to it here makes it  irresistible all over again.
My Boston-Irish sisters & I sing together, & have explained our predilection for soul, gospel, blues & bluegrass by admitting that our parents used the rhythm method. These guys have the rationale that "the Irish are the blacks of Europe, Dubliners the blacks of Ireland, & North Dubliners the blacks of Dublin." Since Dublin means black pool, of all things, I'm thinkin' these guys had it, 100%.
Oh, and I liked the movie as just a movie, too!
