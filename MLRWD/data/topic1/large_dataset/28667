This documentary is a must watch! It is about Nader's fight for genuine democracy, his struggle against a corrupt establishment, and his battle for accountability in government.

Taking the establishment head-on is a dangerous task. It is biblical that you don't challenge the old order; otherwise you will be banished from the Garden of Eden or be crucified. Nader was crucified many times because he dared to tell the truth and confront this old order.

Nader remains unco-opted, incorruptible, and a thorn in the side of the establishment. Unlike our Washington politicians he is never for sale, and will continue to stand for the little people as an icon of truth and integrity.

Nader dedicated his life to fight for a democracy of the people, by the people and for the people (not "from the Exxon, by the General Motors, and for the Dupont"). He will remain a guiding torch for ethics, integrity, and true democracy.

This documentary about this great man is must watch. Rent it, go to the theaters to see it, or buy it!!!
