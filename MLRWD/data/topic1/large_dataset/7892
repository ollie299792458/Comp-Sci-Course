I've heard so many mixed opinions about this movie.
I wanted to see it when it came out in theatres last year.  I was going to go with my friend, but he was ditching school and I had too much stuff to do (or so I  thought).  He saw it and said it was great, one of the best movies he's  seen all year (and he's the toughest movie critic that I know).
So  finally I saw it and loved it.  Reese Witherspoon's character, Tracy Flick,  is great.  I was so surprised to see Witherspoon play such a dislikeable  character, especially after the virgin in Cruel Intentions and her role in  Man in the Moon (not the Jim Carrey movie; a movie from the early nineties  that is GREAT too).  But she was terrific; Tracy Flick reminded me so much  of this "perfect" student that went to high school with me.
I  suggested this movie to all of my friends, and one of my friends hated the  movie.  Its not the stereotypical comedy; you laugh because you hope that  this is only a movie and that politics really doesn't work like this in  real life.
I would say see it, buy it and love it, but its all up to you.
