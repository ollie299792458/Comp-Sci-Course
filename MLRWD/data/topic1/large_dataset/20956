What's next after the Sopranos you ask? You have Boardwalk Empire. A series set in the early 1920s who's main character, portrayed by Steve Buscemi, is Enoch "Nucky" Thompson.

The Thompson character is based off a real life depiction of Enoch "Nucky" Johnson, former sheriff turned into a powerful corrupt political boss of Atlantic City. His illegitimate affairs included control of the liquor business during Prohibition, as well as prostitution.

Popular associates as depicted in the show included the likes of a young Alphonse Capone, young Charles "Lucky" Luciano, and Arnold Rothstein (rumored fixer of the 1919 World Series).

As far as the series, Terrence Winter does an awesome job with the writing of the show. Also, should be noted that Mark Wahlberg, Martin Scorcese, and Steve Buscemi are Executive Producers in some of the episodes. Portrayals by the cast such as Kelly McDonald (Margaret Schroeder), Michael Kenneth Williams (Chalky White, played Omar in "The Wire"), Michael Pitt (James "Jimmy" Darmody) was fantastic, and many more.

This series centers on the political corruption side of the gangster world. Also, it displays the birth of the Italian, Jewish, and Irish mafia stories we love to hear about in our present-day.

My dislikes about this film would be the physical appearances of the portrayed characters. I wasn't ammused to see Capone, Luciano, Johnny Torrio, and even Thompson look nothing like the original men. Those who are detailed picky on film biopics will dislike the facial comparisons, but the fails of the appearances are overshadowed by the well-written, smoothness of the tale. If you like gangster movies or shows, I consider this a must see!
