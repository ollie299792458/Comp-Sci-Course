Hitchcock's Psycho starring Janet Leigh and Antony Perkins was a massive success, we all know that!  The shower scene is probably one of the most memorable scenes imaginable as well as classic dialogue.  Was a sequel ever an area of discussion?  Certainly not for Hitchcock.  The fear of continuing a movie so successful must have been immense but some brave so and so decided to continue the legacy and does so brilliantly.
The year is 1982, 22 years after Norman Bates was convicted of murder.  Now, after years of psychological tests he is released much to the protests of Marion Crane's (shower victim) sister Leila (Vera Miles).  Furious at the news of his release she, together with her daughter attempt to put Norman back in prison by making him go crazy. However someone is also leaving Norman a few notes from his dead mother.  But if it's not Norman who could it be?  This film is an early version of a guess who murder mystery and works extremely well.
Perhaps the only thing that is missed is Bernard Herrman's original musical score which could have given this film the extra lift.  However, despite all this, Psycho 2 is a worthy sequel and well worth the watch.  Watch out for an exciting ending and a twist with a difference!
