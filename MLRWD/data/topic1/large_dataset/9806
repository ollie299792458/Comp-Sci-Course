I realize everybody is entitled to their opinions and I totally respect that. But I still can't believe that so many people loved this movie. I enjoyed Super Troopers and thought it had some really funny moments, so I expected similar results from Club Dread. I honestly don't remember laughing once.
One major problem with the film is that it seemed like it couldn't decide between being a spoof of horror films or an actual horror film, and either way it failed to entertain. I just didn't find the dialogue or characters interesting, with one exception. I actually enjoyed Bill Paxton as Coconut Pete, an obvious reference to Jimmy Buffett. I thought the songs written by Coconut Pete were good parodies of some of Buffett's popular songs. But unfortunately that was not enough to carry the film very far.
Again, if you are a fan of Super Troopers and the Broken Lizard comedy troupe, then you may want to give this a chance. Hey, you might enjoy it a lot more than I did. However, if you are unfamiliar with them and are just looking for a random rental, I would recommend skipping this one.
