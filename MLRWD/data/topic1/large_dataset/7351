Definitely rated R for a reason--lots of gore, swearing, puking, etc.

Anyway, it's definitely not the pure visual candy that Avatar was, but the story is much, much better.  The characters are very intriguing and complex, and the cinematography is quite creative with wicked action scenes and special effects that deserve a respectful salute.

I compare it to Avatar because it follows a similar theme: the humans, not the aliens, are the oppressors.  District 9 did it first, and, I must say, better--instead of paying lip service to every clich&eacute; in the book, it threw them on the floor and stomped on them thoroughly.  The main character (note I didn't say hero because he's far from it), Wikus van der Mewe, is one of the most human and believable characters I've ever seen in a film (which is, if you watch the movie, incredibly ironic). I felt genuine sympathy for the prawns (the aliens), and actually liked them a lot more than most of the humans, despite their chitinous, buggy exterior.

Unlike Avatar, District 9 makes no effort to be pretty; in fact, I'd say it makes a point of showing the genuine ugliness of the situation.  I also liked how the story was told: the film starts out as if it were a documentary, using interviews and news clips, then shifts slowly into more traditional storytelling so seamlessly that the whole thing feels real.  Combine that with the aforementioned believable characters and in-your-face, nitty-gritty visuals, and you get a movie that is both incredibly epic and insanely close to reality.

As much as I love it, it's not for everyone.  District 9 is not a feel-good, escapist adventure, and some scenes are honestly brutal and gut-wrenching.  In my opinion, the freakin' sweet fight scenes (pig-throwing for the win) and the adorable baby prawn (ZOMG SO CUTE) make up for that, but it might not cut it for you.  Rent it first--you won't know for sure until you watch it.
