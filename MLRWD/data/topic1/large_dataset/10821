I have been a fan of "horror" films since I was a young kid. Being fairly young (20 at the time of this review) I didn't have the oppurtunity to see this film when it was on theaters, or even on VHS.

As the newly extended version was released into theaters, I went in expecting the typical Hollywood configuration of blood, guts and perhaps some nudity. What I got was something psychologically penetrating and ultimately far more haunting than any other film in recent memory.

Regan is a tweleve year old girl who has been exhibiting strange behavior, be it seizures or almost schizophrenic like tendencies. As modern medicine fails to provide a solution, her actress mother decides on a different course of action-- an exorcism.

While the characteristics of Regan's possession are indeed frightening, they are not what they seem at first glance. In my opinion, they are clearly an allegory for the emotional unrest faced by the priest who aids her, as his mother is ill and his own faith is begining to be tested as her condition deteriorates.

In the end, he not only faces off against Regan's demonic inhibitor, but also the demons that lie within himself.

This DVD is a very nice job, with picture and sound being sharper and clearer than any other previous addition. The extra footage is a nice touch, though none of it truly changes the plot in any signifcant manner.

So, if you're ready to see a movie that is truly horrific for its very real undertones, then The Exorcist is most definitely for you. Just don't watch it if you plan to go to sleep right after, because I doubt you will!
