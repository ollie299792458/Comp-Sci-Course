One of the best-written TV shows ever is now available on DVD!
From the creators of "Friends" comes a series about Will Truman & Grace Adler. Two best friends, two people who share the same past and who are perfect for each other. The twist in our story is that Will is gay and Grace is straight.
So when Grace  asks Will if he agrees with her decision to marry her boyfriend Danny, and he says no, begins a story that has made us laugh for over 5 years now.
Will and Grace live in New York, and as well as their best friends. Jack , a flamboyant gay man who changes men like shirts, considers himself a "showman" and lives with money Will and his mother. And of course, my personal favorite character, Karen, a spoiled and lazy rich and glamorous woman,with drinking and other kind of ddiction problems who always comments on Grace's clothing choices, "works" for Grace, although as Grace comments " Karen would prefer to chew her own foot than do an honest days work".
 In season 2, we have Grace moving out from Will's apartment to the one next door,Jack producing his new show "Jack 2000", and Karen as always, doing her usual stuff.
Jack has moved to Karen's apartment since in the end of the previous season he married her housekeeper and close "friend", Rosario.
I wouldn't wanna reveal more, 'cause one picture is like a thousand words.
