From the beginnig credits to the very end this was defiantely one of the best movies to come along in the last twenty years.  The special effects were awesome!  This movie was way better than I expected it to be.  If you have been to through the "Haunted Mansion" rides at any of the Magic Kingdoms, then you should see this movie!  The scenery is so accarrate (from the movie) in the movie, that you actually feel as if you are standing in the Mansion with Eddie Murphie and his family!  We couldn't believe it! Go Disney Imgaineers! Those of you like me who have been to both will realize that this movie is made up of a combination of both rides in the states.  This is a wonderful family movie with those who have kids about nine and up.  Much like the ride, this movie is very intense and was scary to kids under 9 in theater. ( So much so that one family ended up leaving.)  Eddie Murphie and his wife are real estate agents who are looking to sell this myesterious "Old Mansion".  The family ends up learning a lot about family and love.  This is destined to be a family classic!  Why didn't Disney make this movie sooner?
