Battle 360 documents the Pacific war through the eyes of the USS Enterprise from Pearl Harbor until the end of the war and the scraping of the USS Enterprise, the most decorated ship in WWII. It is fast paced, well researched and well written, and keeps you in the action, plays like an action movie. Plus there are specs and identification of WWII planes and ships, and several eye witness accounts and historian commentary. The computer graphics are amazing and compelling, you really feel like you are there more so that earlier works. It contains information that was not available, still secret, or politically incorrect to mention in earlier works such as in the "Tigers of the Sea", Vol 6, Wall of Fire. For instance, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, in the "Wall of Fire" it "glides over" Bull Halsey's taking the heavy carriers north, chasing a decoy while, 2,800 brave men were sacrificed in jeep carriers and other light vessels against the giant central Japanese force which saved the US Landing Force at Leyte. This account goes into detail about the brave Commanding Officer E E Evans and the USS Johnson and others for instance. There is so much, for instance, like Twidell's modification of the breathing apparatus that helped save the Enterprise at one point, and that the submarines, like the USS Nautilus (Midway), Albacore, Darter and Dace (Leyte Gulf) and the key roles they played such as in the Battle at Midway. I wish they would have mentioned Joe Rochefort in connection with breaking of "AF" codename by the code breakers. But wait, there is more! Get the series and see.
