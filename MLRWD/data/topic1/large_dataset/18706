Watched the film in the context of recently attending Pacino's performance at the Broadhurst theater.  Both masterful, and while inescapably similar, also subtly unique.

Even more impressed by the complexity of the story; many reviews posted here focus on the "anti-semitism" of the script (fueled by Shylok's bitter baiting.... more aggressively portrayed by Pacino on the stage.)  However I was ultimately in awe of Shakespeare's clever plot twists which expose all hue of character flaw, Gentile and Jew alike, justified in the name of their respective religions and/ or government(a more contemporary staging might have incorporated Tea-baggers and Muslims).  One is left to conclude that the keen-eyed Bard's true contempt was for any bad behavior justified by any formal religion / law, and his true admiration was only for the romantic / idealistic love and faith envisioned soley by the woman of the tale.

The cinematography was beautiful, but pales in comparison to the plot and the passions of the characters (actors).  A great tale well told.
