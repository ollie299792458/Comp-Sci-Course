Saw this when it came out in the movies.  Olivia was still on fire from Grease (hey, that's a pun I didn't intend, but will take!), so naturally, everybody thought, "Olivia Newton-John?  ELO? Great!"  But, no.  I didn't mind that Ms. N-J was supposed to be a mythical muse.  I didn't mind that John Travolta would not be accompanying her this time around.  I really liked (and still do) the songs by ELO.  But when I saw them (not ELO) rollerskating on the rooftops, I said, "Wow.  I'm only 13 (at the time), but even I know you don't rollerskate on the rooftops - what a dumb thing to do!"  Also, there were a whole slew of roller-boogie movies out at the time that were just awful and the whole thing (the rollerskating) left a bad taste in my mouth.  I honestly don't remember the whole plot, just something about some guy who painted and something about a nightclub (I think) and how the guy and Gene Kelly were going to run the club.  I do remember leaving the theater with my head hung in embarrassment.
Lately, my niece has been really into the movie, "Grease," so she ordered "Xanadu" from Netflix.  I got a phone call from her, hysterically laughing, and made out the words, "Newton-John" and "rollerskates" and suddenly, I knew: Xanadu!  I rushed over and we couldn't get through the first half-hour, it was that funny!  (And how did they talk poor Gene Kelly into this?)  So now, everytime somebody does something stupid around here, we say, "Boy, that's about as dumb as rollerskating on a rooftop!"
So, three stars for lovely Olivia, the great soundtrack (love it! Get that instead), and all the belly laughs.
