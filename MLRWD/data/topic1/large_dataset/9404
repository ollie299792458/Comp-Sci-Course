I saw this film on TV when I was very young and I enjoyed the creepy atmosphere.  Most of the social elements went way over my head.  So suffice to say, when I rewatched it, it revealed a whole new level of creepiness.

A lot of the early feminist rhetoric was scary in it's anger and it shows thru Joanna and Bobbi.  The movie also reveals that Stepford was once a big NOW town but has since become housefrau heaven.  Joanna and Bobbi set out to find out why and are doomed.

The disturbing aspect, that noone ever mentions, in this film is that the Stepford men don't want new wives they want their old wives.  I could never understand why Walter needed to change his beautiful wife.  But now with a few years under my belt, I can see that the Eberhardt's marriage is on the rocks.  Joanna is on the verge of becoming a professional photographer and it is a real, unspoken threat that she will take the kids, blow out of Stepford back to the big city. In fact, I would bet that 90% of the Stepford men were in marriages heading into divorce.  The men's club program was a last ditch effort to keep broken marriages intact, to freeze their pretty wives at the height of their beauty and to never be bothered with feminine independence again.  The end of the film is still spooky.

Stay away from the remake.  It just focused on the campy aspects of the original and got it all wrong.  Also, this is 70's film.  Don't expect a lot of action but do expect a lot of great acting.  One very good reason to see this is for Paula Prentiss' great character Bobbi, she never stops being funny.
