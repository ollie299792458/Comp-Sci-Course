I added this DVD to my wish list because I had an old album with one side of Jimi Hendrix and the other Otis Redding back from Monterery Pop. I used to think, "what a strange combination". Over the years, I've grown to like Jimi and Otis more and more, but only through listening to recordings, never by watching videos. Unfortunately, they both died young when I was a small child, so this is the best I'm going to get.

This DVD set includes a DVD with two short films that include their entire sets from the festival. Trust me, if you like Jimi & Otis, you've got to get this DVD. Jimi is absolutely amazing in his showmanship - he throws in all kinds of gestures including tricks like playing his guitar behind his back, behind his head, with his teeth -- and if you close your eyes, you can't even tell -- his playing is that good.

There are great commentaries as well, including one from Otis' manager of many years.

The only reason I gave this DVD four stars instead of 5 is that I wish it had more Janis Joplin on it. We only get two songs from Janice, but we get 4 or 5 Tiny Tim tunes that I can't bear to watch because it makes me think of what we could have seen if Tiny Tim had been eliminated from the set.
