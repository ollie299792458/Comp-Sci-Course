This is Doris Day in one of her most enthusiastic performances (and her own personal favorite) as the tomboy-ish sharp shooter known as "Calamity Jane".  Though the story is not to be taken as acurate historical fact, this film is strictly to entertain, which it does and then some!  Day is simply superb, storming around the sets, shooting, singing and dancing.  It's fun to watch Day trying to go from tomboy to sophisticated lady to win her man.  Howard Keel, an always welcome addition to any film, especially with that voice of his, is a great match for Day as Wild Bill Hickock. They make a great team and it's a real shame they didn't make more films together. Great musical numbers and songs include "Whip Crack-Away", "A Woman's Touch", "The Black Hills of Dakota", "The Windy City", "I Can Do Without You" and the Oscar-winning "Secret Love".  This film starts off with an energetic bounce and maintains that pace all the way through, with some great laughs.  The cast is rounded out by Phillip Carey and Allyn McLerie (in the ingenue role of Katie Brown), who both provide fine support for the two leads.
