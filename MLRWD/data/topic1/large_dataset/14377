My only complaint with The Thin Blue Line is there aren't enough episodes.  This show is hilarious.  The "thin blue line" speeches of Inspector Fowler are so funny (ever had a Fisherman's Friend") as he puts his foot in his mouth more with every word.  I like Constible Gladstone.  When he talks about how he put his foot down to his wife and then he owns up to the fact that after he told her how it was going to be he never saw her again cracks me up.  Inspector Grim has to be the dimmest bulb to ever put on a badge.  His strings of  descriptive adjectives is mind boggling and extremely funny if not bordering on cruel. For us Inspector Fowler fans who have watched Grim run down Fowler's obvious love of police work, tradition and his staff, we get our own back during the episode about Grim's son.  My personal all time favorite show is the Christmas show.  For those of us who feel that british comedy beats all others world wide or if you are new to collecting british comedy this show is not to be missed.  BBC - bring back The Thin Blue Line if nothing else at least a special episode that those of us in the U.S. can purchase.
