As several have written, the story is a composite of things that happened, not the actual story of the Memphis Belle.  Given that, it was enjoyable to watch many of the scenes of the aircraft in flight.  As far as the crew, every cliche ever imagined was pulled into play, and the crew didn't behave as if they had 24 missions under their belts - more like it was the very first mission for an untrained crew.  Childish interaction, continual chatter even after the captain instructed them to keep the intercom clear.  Maybe forgiveable in the heat of the mission, but my experience as a Huey Aircraft Commander in Vietnam tells me that when the chips are down, even a squirrelly crew member focuses on the job at hand, not schoolboy bickering.  And, although perhaps needed for the benefit of the audience's understanding, it strained credibility for the captain to instruct the crew on the minutiae of things they need to remember.  After 24 missions, I would think they could finish each others' sentences.  Poor screenplay, poor direction, fun to watch the big bombers in action.
