Alot of the current viewers of this film seem to forget that film is not only about entertainment...Many of its themes - race fear, race war, the myth of the Old South, myths of Black and White sexuality - remain relevant and troubling ninety years after the film's release.

Things you must know in order to understand this film are that the south had only a few years earlier fallen and D.W. Griffith's father was a Confederate Army General and the KKK were rising in number and power...The South was being divided up and reperations in the form of land and welfare was being handed out to the newly freed slaves...

Although this film is in many forms racist, D.W. Griffith is neverless a prolific director.  His next film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JA8UF2">Intolerance (Enhanced) 1916</a> was more or less an apology for The Birth of a Nation and is equally as epic and historical.  He also directed a semi-biography about one of this nation's greatest leaders, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001NNLT8">D.W. Griffith Presents Abraham Lincoln</a> which many say is a contiuation of that apology...

In any event, this film is historic and this version comes with the original movie trailer, a rarely seen bonus feature.
