If you consider yourself a film buff, and have not seen Citizen Kane, you might want to reconsider.  Citizen Kane is considered by most critics the greatest movie ever made.  I can tell you that it is one of the best I have seen.  This film is not great only because of technical innovations, it has amazing storytelling as well.  Some people will tell you that this film is pretentious and boring but thats because those people have the attention spans of a puppy smoking crack.  Citizen Kane tells the story of newspaper publisher Charles Foster Kane, who dies at the beginning of the film immediately after whispering the word "rosebud".  A news reporter spends the duration of the movie trying to figure out what rosebud means.  It is said that Citizen Kane is based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, who owned a newspaper empire that spread across the U.S.  Hearst did everything in his power to halt this release in its tracks but it goes without saying that he failed.  I encourage any film goer to watch this masterpiece of film, it is undeniably, a milestone and this edition of the film is the best.  The quality is amazing, as well as the set.  Orson Welles was a genius.
