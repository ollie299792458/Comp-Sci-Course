I first saw this delight in, I think, 1983 on 'Channel 4', and as far as I know this is the only time the whole flick has been shown on mainstream tv in the UK. Thence I obtained a 'Rhino' VHS that had the truly awful 3-D print. And now, here it is on wonderful DVD.
The dear reader need not be troubled again with the plot (if you can call it that), or the special effects (you most certainly can't call them that - after the Ro-mans themselves my favourite is the spaceship where you can momentarily see the hand and wire holding it up!); others have said more than enough. It suffices to verify that if you are only going to own one dreadful film in your collection, then it should be either this one or Plan 9 from Outer Space or, perhaps, The Beast from Yucca Flats (if Santa Claus Conquered the Martians was available on DVD that would make it four).
Not untypically there are a few minor gripes, and a comparison is begged with the DVD edition of 'Plan 9 ... '. The latter is a better buy in that it has been cleaned up more, especially the sound, and there are many more 'extras'. It may be that no-one has done any serious work on Robot Monster, which would be a pity, but if my memory serves me correct the Channel 4 showing referred to had a humorous introduction by Michael Medved. Perhaps that is lost though. Also you STILL don't get to see the bare bosom that the Rhino people had unkindly blacked out. If these were corrected then all 5 stars would have been awarded without hesitation.
Otherwise, watching this is an experience you will never forget.
