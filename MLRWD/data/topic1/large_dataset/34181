The story of Afro Samurai, I must admit was very interesting; A Ronin samurai drifting to avenge the death of his father, somewhat clich&eacute; but its still able to stand on its own merits. The biggest problem I have with the sequel is the existence of filler that is not necessary to the story line. The random act of sex, sex, and more sex, was almost like beating a dead horse with a stick. The border line porn was a huge distraction from the main focus of the plot, even with the trendy beats from the RZA, stylish animation, and the great voice acting. That being said, Afro Samurai Resurrection has its strong points; the soundtrack, the stylish animation, and the very commendable voice acting by Samuel L. Jackson and Lucy Lu; which all add to the overall experiences instead of taking away from it.  Buying the film on Blue Ray is the way to go to really appreciate all aspects of the production value. As far as the plot the goes, this direction of the story turns Afro into the villain by murdering a young boys father for the # 2 head band, similar to what Justice committed to Afros father. Which ends up creating a circular story that will never really end, which begs the question? "What's the point?"
