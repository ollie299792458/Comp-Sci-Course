I will admit that I went into the film expecting to be disappointed, but I ended up enjoying the ride.  The villain, Rusty Nails, is truly creepy and his pursuit of the main characters stressed me out to the very end.  The premise of the film is much like all the roadside thrillers (The Hitcher being the most famous).  Psycho killer stalks young prey down the lonely highway.  This time, the killer is savage and angry.  There is something more terrifying when you understand why he is going after these people and what he does to the first victim is absolutely disturbing.
Paul Walker and Steve Zahn are terrific.  Paul Walker has a killer smile.  Steve Zahn is wonderful as his delinquent brother.  And they both get naked.  Adding to the suspense is Leelee Sobieski.  The fact that she is innocent and all this, but becomes a target none-the-less really sucks in the audience.  This is a great suspenseful film!
Now the DVD is an added plus.  Apart from the usual special features, this includes an option to watch the original version of the film.  Halfway through the movie, you can set it up for an icon to appear.  This icon will take you through an alternate version of the film!  An enitrely different half hour ride!  If you've already seen the film and liked it, get the DVD!  If you enjoyed films like The Hitcher or Jeepers Creepers, then this is a must-have for your collection.
