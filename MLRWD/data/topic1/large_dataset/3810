This was an amusing movie, if rather predictable.  Two cute actors play gay college lovers at the Christmas holidays.  One has to go home to his parents from Minnesota (with great accents, don'cha know!) who don't know he's gay and are trying to fix him up with the girl next door.  The other, the son of cold, rich and distant parents, is suddenly on his own for Christmas as his parents decided to go abroad for the holidays without him and didn't tell him until he was on his way home.
  So he shows up unexpectedly at his lover's for the holidays.  Complications ensue which threaten to part the lovers but a happy ending saves the day (and Christmas.)  The closet case comes out to his parents (who suspected anyway and are fine with it), and the lonely lad starts to re-develop a relationship with his mother at least.
  This isn't deathless cinema history--our lead actors are not exactly thespians and the production values are limited--but I don't understand the really negative reviews.  It was worth the price and it makes a fun addition to the stack of holiday movies.
