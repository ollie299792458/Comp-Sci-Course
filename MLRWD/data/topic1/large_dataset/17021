"Christmas is a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely" --Charles Dickens.

Attempting to celebrate Christmas without watching at least ONE adaptation of this Dickens classic is a bit like trying to play snooker in black and white. Each year I try to watch one 'serious' adaptation (usually the 1951 Alastair Sim classic) and also one parody. Of the latter, the 1992 Muppet production tops the list. Michael Caine is Scrooge, while Kermit the frog is Bob Cratchett and Gonzo plays Charles Dickens. I dislike most musicals. It's often stated that Bollywood is the complete reverse of the Roger & Hammerstein / Gilbert & Sullivan musicals because in India it's the dialogue that's woeful and music that's good. The Muppet Christmas Carol is in a league of its own and actually excels at both! The soundtrack includes "Bless us All", "One More Sleep till Christmas" and the wonderfully festive "It Feels Like Christmas". Here, the songs ENRICH the story rather than interrupt it.

Dickens's haunting tale and the countless movies it's inspired are not just for children. Christmas joy is, in the words of Ella Fitzgerald, "for kids from 1 to 92". This is genuine 'family' entertainment... "For it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself"
