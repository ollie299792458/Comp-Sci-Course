This was a great rocky movie. It brought the true realities of a successful boxer that had previously encountered fame then went through the present harshness of financial troubles. It also deals with a boxer that has a strong desire to fight for a reason to support his family but cannot because of his severe brain damage injuries sustained by Ivan Drago. It also deals with the aspect of family and how they play an integral part of Rocky. Especially the relationship with his wife and son. I personally feel that their support throughout the last fight with Tommy Gunn helped Rocky on an emotional level to bring back his fighting spirit against Tommy Gunn. Tommy gunn's character also shows how the aspects of greed also affect a boxer's lust for greed. The previous Rocky films did not touch base with the inner realities of a boxer and as a result were mainly based on the 'standard train and fight for a purpose' formula. I felt that this was a great rocky and is a sequal that should not be ignored by any means.
