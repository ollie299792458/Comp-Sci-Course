One of the most poignant performances Paul Newman ever gave was in this brilliant film, "Cool Hand Luke" from 1967. Newman plays a Southern convict and loner who specializes in putting up a front with his fellow inmates and prison guards. His strong will, humor, and smile make him such a likable character. Even though the time period is set in the 1940s, one may feel that he/she is viewing a 1960s presentation due to its camera transition scenes, music, and themes of the time period (post-World War II {Vietnam for the 1960s} and lack of communication between people).

All in all, this is a very enjoyable film. The color, quality of sound, direction, and plot were fashioned together quite well. The viewer also has the opportunity to see fine performances from actors, Jim Jeter (Little House on the Prairie), Ralph Waite, Robert Donner (The Waltons), and Morgan Woodward (Dallas). This masterpiece is one not to be missed by those who are interested in the criminal justice system as well as the conflicts of the mid-20th century.
