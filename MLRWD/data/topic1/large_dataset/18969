and even Paul McCartney admits on the commentary track it suffered from indulgence. At the time of its first (limited) run in theaters, I recall most of my friends agreed... that we could no longer consider our beloved Beatles perfect, and certainly not as film makers. However, the concept was a good one and had it been left to seasoned film makers, perhaps it wouldn't have seemed so hodge-podge and, having benefitted from a script, would have been more coherent. The structure of Michael Nesmith's Elephant Parts is really quite similar, but without the bus.  (3 stars on the film)

As far as the new blu-ray is concerned, a satisfying print was somehow gleaned from the substandard 16mm celluloid and the music compositions have been given a remarkable surround treatment, one of which I'm happy to say has finally been remixed in stereo from beginning to end (I Am The Walrus). It's worth the price if only just for the music videos (Fool On The Hill, Flying, Blue Jay Way, I Am The Walrus, and Your Mother Should Know),  which can be directly accessed on the search menu. One personal mystery was solved; I always thought the aerial footage utilized on "Flying" was derived from Stanley Kubrick's  Dr. Strangelove. Paul commented that's precisely where he got it (with permission, of course). (5 stars on the blu-ray)
