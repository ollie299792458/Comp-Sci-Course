I loved Vanilla Sky for all of its creativity and guts! Cameron Crowe deserves so much credit for putting out an amazing and truly different movie in times that often only accepts copy cat moviemaking. So it was no surprise this movie opened to not all glowing reviews and as many haters as lovers of the film. This was the most underrated movie of the year and deserved some award attention. Tom Cruise gives his best performance EVER! He was remarkable and I'm not even one of his biggest fans, but he proved himself as an actor with this truly challenging role. The other Cruz was so perfect and charming and a joy to watch. And then there is Diaz, all I can say is WOW! I love her, she is so mind-blowing and in this role proves she's not just the sweetheart funny comedy girl, she's so much more. She gives a completely frightening performance as the obsessive lover of Cruise's David. This film is about making you think and looking at your own life. The things you can't change, the moments you wish you had back. What is reality? What is dreamworld? This is one powerful film. Another one to add to the collect. Thanks to Cameron Crowe who keeps making my favorite movies!!! Almost Famous rocked!!! As does this! SEE this movie! Open your eyes man!
