Despite the violence and lack of story, this firm is marvelously shot. The filming techniques are definitely Hollywood standard to me. The way the camera rotates is excellent done. The act of the scene of hundreds of people fighting together was excellent made. The only glitch I would say was the beginning. The team killing part is totally nonsense, because the movie did not depict the training to be cruel, but a time for those kids to develop their own friendship. Then suddenly the Jii wanted them to kill each other. A similar movie is called Naked Weapon. The beginning was the same. However, the teacher in that movie started to kill losers at very early stage, so the entire training was full of hate and violence. Then it is understandable for the following team killing. But in Azumi, the Jii did not kill any losers himself. So this beginning is totally a failure. Except this, everything else was done perfectly.

Two additional comments

1. I do think the swording skills need to be improved. They cut each other like how I use my knife to kill a chicken for the first time. It is below amateur level.

2. Does nintendo have any game about Azumi? I really want to have it. I played Izuna 1 and 2. Izuna is as cute as Azumi. I wonder who would win if two of them fight!
