In light of the world we live in now this movie should be a must see. It makes one feel a bit uncomfortable to watch the characters maneuver around a world where increasing terrorism is met with increasing security and oppression. The movie begins with an insect lighting on a keyboard causing a typographical error. This typo leads to the wrong individual being picked up for "questioning" in relation to terrorism. The poor man dies in the interrogation (torture) and our unlikely protagonist is drawn into a series of events as a result.

It is a complex movie with many messages and complex layers of detail. So much so that the movie merits multiple viewings before you catch it all. I love reading the posters in the background. A couple of my favorites; "Don't suspect a friend---report him" and a travel poster advertising a week free from anxiety and panic in a security free zone.  Other scenes that stay with me are vehicles traveling a road with huge advertisement billboards lining it completely so that you don't see anything but advertisement after advertisement when you drive. The camera pulls back and we see what the vehicles do not, behind the billboards the countryside is an environmental wasteland.

The plot is convoluted though and at times the movie feels overlong. There is so much to absorb one can feel oversaturated by the movie, especially on first viewing. The atmosphere in the film is one of a sort of strange surrealism. Computers have old typewriter keyboards and elements that suggest a futuristic society are combined with elements of the past and those that feel more like an alternative dimension to the one we are in. Sort of like you stepped into a Dali painting. All this can make the movie a little dense to wade through at first. Worth the effort though and makes repeat viewing more enjoyable.
