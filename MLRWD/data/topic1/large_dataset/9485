..Well..at least its in my top 5 =o)..I'm not the biggest Chaplin fan.more of a Keaton and Lloyd..kinda guy..But dang if this movie dosen't do me in everytime..I never fail to fall into hysterics over the "Feeding Chair" Scene..or the Gibberish song..and several other scenes.and I always get teary eyed over the plight of Charlie and his little love Gamin..This movie just packs so much into its 89 or so minutes and it all flows beautifully from one frame to the next!...Don't be botherd by the hype about this being a social commentary..or a Commie film or whatever!..Its still the same little tramp who goes against any kind of social order!!....Now I have this wonderful new 2 disc Mk2 version from the Chaplin Collection box to pull out every Christmas Holiday season..along with City Lights..as I'm want to do..and Check out the little Cuban documentary on the second disc about the Traveling projectionists who take the Movie to a remote farming village to show to the people for the first time..The Tears in these peoples eyes as they watch..tell you everything about this wonderful one of a kind film!
