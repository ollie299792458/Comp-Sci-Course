I love this movie.  It is definately one of my all time favorites.  I can't believe it took this long to make it to DVD.  Walter puts in a great performance.  Of course Joe Don Baker is a classic.  He has tons of quotable lines.  Andy Robertson (the psycho from Dirty Harry part 1) plays Charlie Varrick's partner.  Another great performance.

The movie is about a guy who has a crop dusting business.  Unfortunately the crop dusting business is going the way of all buffalo because of changes in how pesticides are applied etc.  So Charlie Varrick decides he needs a way to make a little money to retire on.  He and a couple other guys decide to rob a bank.  They rob a little bank out in the middle of Nevada.  They make a HUGE score and that is the problem.  It turns out the mafia is using the bank to launder money.  The rest of the movie is Charlie trying to get away from the mafia and outsmart the goon that they send after him (Joe Don Baker).

Please do yourself a huge favor and buy it right now.
