I've been listening to KISS for several years now. As a matter of fact, I first got into that band while I was living in Israel. Heck, I even played the role of Gene Simmons in Colombia's only and now sadly defunct tribute band called KISZ.

Despite the fact that this DVD that'll be released in December sounds kinda cool, let's face it, KISS have become that which Mr. Tongue and Mr. Stanley so admirably criticised in one of their home videos: a "sugar coated band"!!! Now all they can think about is how to rip off their loyal fans with the release of 'refried' material that only proves their 'God-like' devotion to the Almighty Dollar!!!

It would be great to see this band, even with the "trained monkeys" (aka Tommy Thayer and the Great Eric Singer), release some type of new CD ASAP. Let's face it, "Psycho Circus" wasn't that great and it was made available to the general public back in 1998!!!!!  I mean, COME ON!!!!

I would also have to agree that KISS have become their own tribute band. Pretty PATHETIC, eh !!!!! And this was THE HOTTEST BAND IN THE WORLD!!!! Now they're as cold as a limp and aged TURKEY!!!!!
