** SPOILERS INCLUDED **

Children, especially teenagers, are smarter than what parents think.
Hence, the foundation of the plot is absurd for these reasons: 1) a 14 year old high school freshman girl meets a guy online who she thinks is a sophomore.... 2)...then the guy admits the he is really in college (she keeps talking to him)... 3)... then the guys admits that he is a graduate student (she is still talking to him)... 4)...then they meet in person and they looks like he's 40! (she still talks to him).

Really?  No, really?

This was a .99 rental on Amazon Instant Video and I stopped the movie right there.
It was just impossible for me to believe that in the age of 'To Catch a Predator' and extensive media coverage of situations like this that a modern teenage girl wouldn't have run for dear life, or at the very least realized that the guy was a creep and ditched him.

Giving it 2 stars because of the great acting in the 30 minutes that I watched.
