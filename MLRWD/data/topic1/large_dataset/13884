Based on the wonderful books of Patrick O'Brian 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' is far and away the most authentic 'Age of Sail' film that has been made to date. The Ship used to play HMS Surprise was HMS Rose a replica 28 gun Royal Navy Frigate. The uniforms are accurate. In Battle the guns leap back & fire solid iron cannon balls (not shells) that produce the clouds of splinters that in fact caused most casualties in the days of the Wooden Walls.

The Director sets out to show us a close up of life in a crowded wooden warship in the early 19th Century & he succeeds in his aim, right from a very early shot of a mass of men sleeping in swinging hammocks.

Beautiful photography, a script including a great deal taken from Patrick O'Brian novels, several exciting battle scenes, humour, a very good sound track & some good acting add up to one of the best historical war films in years.

There is so much in the film it actually is one that repays watching several times. I throughly reccommend it.
