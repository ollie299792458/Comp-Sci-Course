I loved the movie. Everything about it was enjoyable: the scenery, the acting (WOW. Bale and Crowe are great together, awesome chemistry), the plot and YES, the infamous ending. It was suspenseful, I cared about even the minor characters, and I understood the motives throughout the movie. Great action and gunplay.
Yes, there are plotholes. But every movie has them, and I was so caught up while watching it that I just didn't care. I'm not one to pick apart a movie anyway, unless it's an arthouse film. I think it's a great way to spend two hours, and if you love it like I did, you'll watch it again and again and recommend it to your friends.
It has lots to say about the measure of a man, who we are when no one is watching, God, redemption, and the human heart. I won't bother with a summary as so many others have already done that.
Just watch it. If you enjoy good action, good chemistry between co stars, exploring relationships, and a man's need to be a hero, plus suspense and good old fashioned shoot em ups,  I think you'll at least like, if not love it !
