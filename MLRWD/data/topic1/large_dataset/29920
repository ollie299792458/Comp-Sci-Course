When was the last time you saw a DVD with Portugese subtitles? Anyway...
Oh, how I love eye candy... This one has girls, gadgets, some good actions scene and oh some teasers of some of the girls...
The last time we saw Qi Shu was in "The Transporter" where her character was the opposite of the one she plays in the movie. From the beginning we see that the movie looks like it will live up to the description with the CGI graphics. Next we see Lynn Qi Shu and then the first action scene starts. There is free use of wire acrobatics with subtle moves that put a smile on your face. Then from there we meet each of the other main two characters, Sue her sister and Hong Yat Hong the CSI investigating the crime scene.
There are plenty of subplots and a big twist and turn here and there. Sometimes it seems predictable, but only to a certain point. I could tell you more of the plot, but the individual pieces are nothing orginal except when that kink in thrown in there it takes the overall feel of the movie on a different direction.
Like I said earlier, you will have trust me on this one, this picture is worth a millon words. My writing skills are nowhere near up to the task of describing the action. 
Audio: Viewed in Mandarin 5.1 with English Subtitles. Well I just moves, I only had 3.1 sound (no sides) but the audio was clear and there was a good ampount of directionality across the three main speakers. The subtitles were very good, no gramatical errors I could detect. I do not speak Mandarin so I cannot speak of translation errors.
Video: Being such a new movie the transfer is clean, cross coloration almost non existent and colors looking like they should.
