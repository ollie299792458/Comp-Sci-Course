This always happens! A terriply bad movie gets aclaim because it has an (un)interesting idea.True  a new math genius from humble beginings is a good idea for a movie,but the idea is never expanded upon and the plot  falls apart and the viewers never notice and they heap tons of false prise  on it! What is my interatation? An overhyped blob of moving images in which  we,the viewers are fooled into thinking this is a good movie! Did anything  happen in this movie at all! Or I'm supposed to belive that these people in  this film are "actors",who "act".Also this is an  obvious ego trip of Matt Daemon and Ben Affilct.Did you know that in  addition to staring in this "film",they have also wrote the  script and boy did they ever make their charecters humble.Why,in this movie  they can have sex,swear,defy athority,be geniuses,fight(and win!),drink  alot,etc.All because they wrote it into the script to satisfy their  adoulesent fantasies.Hollywood,don't make another movie like this!
