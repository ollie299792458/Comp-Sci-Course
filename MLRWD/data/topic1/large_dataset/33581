So you don't understand the 1960s international context that motivates this video?.... Not to worry!  Are you skeptical that humor on film could have such an extended shelf life?...No concern!  Perhaps you're not familiar with the somewhat twisted path taken by the fertile mind of Carl Reiner?...Now there's something you need to change!

"The Russians Are Coming!  The Russians Are Coming!" tugs on the viewer with a combination of mini-projectiles of finely-nuanced verbal and visual humor, an improbable (although entirely possible) interplay of chance events, the tension of sleepy small-town lethargy being challenged by large outside forces, and the skillful (and often amusing) development of the characters by an array of presenters in a variety of roles.

Slightly-skewed intellectual humor makes this video work;  just when you begin to think you're ahead of it, the ambush comes. "Muriel, Muriel!"...  "Yes, we are Norviegans!"..."Whittaker Walt...".  Connect your sensory apparatus up to this one and life will never be the same.
