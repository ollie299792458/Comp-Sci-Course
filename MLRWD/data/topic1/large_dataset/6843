When I first started doing these videos I knew they would be tough so I worked up to them with my own exercises like walking and doing the exercise bike.  Then I started out slowly by doing just the ten minute workout for a week.  After that I felt ready to do the longer ones but then only as many reps as I could handle.  After it ceased to be as challenging I increased the weights and concentrated more on slow control.
Yes, you will be sore, but never a bad sore.  I was so proud to feel that way--I knew I had had a good workout.  And the reason I knew I hadn't damaged myself is because I never hurt(as opposed to burn) when I did the exercises, and I always felt good when I was done.  Interestingly enough the more sore I was, the more necessary I felt it was to exercise again.  And doing that always made me feel better!  Kudos to all the five star reviews--you covered just about everything for me.  I was so upset about the editorial and was relieved to see that there were people out there who knew what they were talking about.
