There's not much to say really.  I've spent hours and hours watching this movie, the extras, and the commentaries, so much so that at one point Kevin Smith advised me to "get a friend."  It's absolutely hilarious and disgusting and brilliant.  In the extras, Smith and his producer Mosier call it their favorite production by far.  I can't say I disagree with them.  I even showed it to my dad who had never seen the original and he loved it.  This movie is a pretty big jump over the original Clerks when it comes to picture and I found the bright purples and yellows to really stand out in high definition.  I can't compare it to the DVD as far as the transfer goes, but it was generally a good looking movie (especially the parts with Rosario Dawson).  It's easily one of the better purchases I've made and on top of that, the extras are in HD, too.  If you already own the DVD, I can't say an upgrade is really necessary, but if you don't already have this and you know you like the movie, buy this version.
