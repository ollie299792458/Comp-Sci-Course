Rock Haven should have had all the ingredients of a good movie. The scenery was spectacular and the storyline was the tops but it was sadly let down by the two main actors in my mind.
Sean Hoagland is a good actor and looks the part but in this movie he was clearly too old for his role and if he had acted it more maturely he would have been credible but he tended to over act it tying to make his part a boy of 18 and in doing so he came over as if he was rather simple. This spoilt it for me completely.
Owen Alabado I had never heard of and his acting in my eyes was dreadful from start to finish. Was he so obviously taken in with his own image that it reflected on his performance? He pranced and preened all the way through the movie and was not good at all. He was expressionless in most scenes which again was distracting. This is my opinion and I will not want to see any more movies by him - has he made any??
To end, it could have been a top movie but was let down by the acting in my mind. One actor who is a good actor but played it wrong and another actor whom I didn't know playing it as if he was God's gift to the acting profession.
Thumbs down I am afraid for this movie.
