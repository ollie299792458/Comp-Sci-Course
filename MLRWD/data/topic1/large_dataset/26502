First, I agree with much of what was said in earlier reviews. There is some great music on this DVD, and I wouldn't pigeon-hole it as country... its head and shoulders above what is known as "country music" today. Rather than point out the good points of the disk, I will explain why I only give it three stars. It is largely because the DVD authoring was done by complete amateurs. There is no song index. Not only is the song index missing from the DVD's navigation system, there is not one on the box. The chapters that do exist are very coarse for the length of this documentary. Understand that I'm not suggesting that this fine documentary should have been chopped up into songs... DVD authoring allows very comprehensive navigation systems to be overlaid on a film without altering the original material. It's just whoever was in charge of mastering the DVD has less imagination and/or technical ability than I could have done on my PC. It seems like they want to force you to watch from start to finish every time. The beauty of concerts on DVD should be that they allow you to do that, or to skip to songs like on a CD, since after you've watched it 3 or 4 times, you know what your favortite parts are. My kids could do better DVD authoring. Maybe if they had at least WATCHED some other music DVD before they tried to do it for a real production, they would have had a clue. Any of the Eric Clapton concerts, or Eagles, or anything.
As far as the material, the only real low point of the underlying material (to me) was Gillian Welch singing "I wanna sing that rock and roll". It didn't fit the event, and it certainly didn't fit the place. And even beyond that song, in the pre-show documentary and in other songs, she comes across as an insecure dweeb. But fortunately, she's not the star of show. (The guy that sings with her should go solo.) Before this DVD, I had liked what little I'd heard of Gillian Welch. Now I can't stand her.
