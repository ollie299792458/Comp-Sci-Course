No matter where you go and who you ask, this movie will always be mention as the most scariest movie ever.  To achieve that status, this movie still scare people from different generations in forms of shock value and visual extremes, from the first theater showing to the DVD in DVD player.

The movie was made in the 70's, giving the old and classic look to this movie.  Some scenes of the movie are shown in the day time, but the rest of the movie is dark and murky looking, with the fog and the coldness.  The cast for the characters are great, especially Linda Blair, who was around 11 or 12 years old when she played the role of the demon possessed child Reagan.  Her acting really excels in this performance, some might think her acting might be too extreme and vulgar for a young girl.

This version is different from the orignal theatrical release, some scenes are added.  The most memorable and horrific scene added is the "spider walk" down the stairs.  That scene is chilling and spooking, thinking how is that possible.  Reagan do not even look human, which makes that scene terrorfying.

Overall the success of this movie is the reality of the story.  This event is based on actual experiences, written as a novel, and later adapted to the movie.  This is the most scariest movie ever and if you have never seen this movie, you have to because it will never go away.
