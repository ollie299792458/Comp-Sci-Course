As a HUGE CE3K dork, and someone who's gonna eventually own this ANYWAY, it is both with a sense of complete ridiculousness and a sense of, well, MORE ridiculousness, that I post the following questions...

Being familiar with the '77 version of the film by way of my childhood and the lovely and amazing Criterion laserdisc, I'm curious about a few shots that Spielberg had removed from the film on laserdisc and included only as trims on the ends of the appropriate sides. And those are...

1) The UFO passing over Neary's truck as he speeds towards 'Harper Valley', which didn't appear until the Special Edition. Did they include that in the '77 version on DVD? Or is it the proper longer shot of Neary in his truck as he drives along?

2) The extra, if highly non-important, shots of folks in neighboring yards going about their 'regular' business as Neary watches from his window after building Devil's Tower in his living room. Are they there?

3) The shot of Neary, Jillian and LARRY! actually escaping the helicopter ("Go for the mountain!"). Is it in there?

Okay, that's it. Just stupid me wondering aloud about something I'll find out for myself soon enough.

Love,
Big Dork
