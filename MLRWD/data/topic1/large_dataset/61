I got the one shipped and sold by amazon so I am very surprised to say I think I got a bootleg. The dvd would not read on my players, I get a disc error. I thought maybe a bad dvd. I tried my computer to see if it would read the file at all and it just freezes the software on an endless load cycle. I had to take the dvd out to close the program. I noticed the name of the disc was Muppets_us which I found extremely odd and tipped me off to the fact this might be a bootleg at that point. Then I recalled when I opened the dvd which was shrink wrapped, there was absolutely no protective white sticker strip over the top of the dvd. Those are definitely always present, especially something like a Disney dvd. Then I realized that this was a Disney dvd, which we had an issue before here and on ebay but those were clearly horrible fakes. This one actually passed under my radar and I did not notice the missing strip at all.  I just looked up how to spot a fake, and low and behold . . .

"All authentic US edition brand new Disney DVDs come with security on the top or side.  Most of them also come with thick ink printed Buena Vista stamp on the back of the shrink wrap except some DVDs they distribute through Disney movie club"

So it is now verified, this is in fact a bootleg / knock off / foreign import / shrink wrapped sold by amazon disney dvd. As such, I never thought I would say this, but I am going back to the stores to buy our movies from now on.
