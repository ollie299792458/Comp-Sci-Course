The Movie:

For some reason, I felt like Mel Gibson was trying to show us our current state of affair in this move in a subliminal manner. The scene in the big city, people and rules reminded me our current state of operation in our country. Those who know and those who do not know while continue to be manipulated by knowledge owners. Good catch Mel...

I know Mel Gibson missed the Academy Award on this piece, simply he got drunk and said things he should not have. But, the movie should not have been punished. A film is a team work, result of hundreds of artists contributing to every second of it. That is why Academy of MP is piece of crap..Voting based on politics solely, not art..I am awarding the best movie of the year to this film.... Period...

The scenes are simply breath taking, actors are well chosen and acted.

Media:

Originally, I watched this on a theater screen, but the Blu-ray I received is showing the film in adjusted cine-action mode, making the film look like day time soap opera. And, I know my TV setting is off for motion enhancement. I never use it. Something about the way the movie as transferred to Blu-Ray. Not a big deal. I think, because the scenes are so fast pace that perhaps, producers wanted to minimize the pixelation issues by using motion enhancement on Blu-Ray

VERDICT: BUY IT !
