Birth of a Nation is director D.W. Griffith's powerful but violently controversial masterwork depicting the post-U.S. Civil War experiences of two families, the Stonehams of Pennsylvania and the Camerons of Virginia.  The Stonehams (fictional replacements for the very real Radical Republican Congressman Thaddeus Stephens and his family) revel in the North's victory and the imposition of abolitionist policies in the South.  The Camerons are depicted as put-upon defeated Southerners trying desperately to preserve the beliefs and morality of the Old South.  Portrayed as victims of Northern aggression, the Camerons are beset by newly freed slaves who threaten their lives and livelihoods, including attempting a rape (a controversial subject in 1915 film making) by a former slave of one of the Cameron daughters.  Riding to the "rescue" of Southern womanhood is the "heroic" Ku Klux Klan, Hell-bent on preserving the South and driving out the invading Northern carpetbaggers and subjugating the newly freed slaves.

The debates that have raged over this film have focused on the depiction of the KKK as a heroic organization and of Northerners as aggressive and vicious conquerers, equating all Northerners with the barbaric hordes who destroyed "noble" Rome.  Controversy has focused on whether Southern-born Griffiths was himself a racist and deliberately depicted the KKK in a positive light or was the film meant to be an ironic rendering of Thomas Dixon's racist play, "The Clansman"  There can be no denying that "Birth of A Nation" is a powerful film about a violent period in post-Civil War US history.  It is a film that bears watching, not only for the story of the film itself but also for it's reflections of the virulent racism present in US society in the years prior to the US entry into WWI.
