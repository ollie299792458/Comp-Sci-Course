This is by no means a thoroughly objective view of Alexander and his life but it does do what it claims-to retrace the footsteps of Alexander as he continued exploring for the ends of the earth while seeking revenge.  This documentary is not meant to dissect Alexander's persona through exhaustive historical accounting or through scholarly discussions.  It simply tries to impart a small part of Alexander's character by showing what tremendous hardships he and his army endured and overcame, on their way from Macedonia to India. It retraces his footsteps not his being.

Though it does not necessarily explore the man, it does impart some insights. It shows a man of deep passions, perseverance, endurance, hardiness, foolhardiness, intelligence, a military genius with luck on his side and the possessor of a will of iron.  In short, he definitely was a man of mettle and one who changed the course of the world and shaped the thoughts of men for generations to come.

His journeys are re-traced step-by-step through the various territories he conquered.  The battle strategies are not discussed in depth.  Some are outlined in passing but they do paint a picture of a man who would not be denied and who could lead men by his willpower alone.  In short, this is a terrific documentary though it is somewhat one dimmentional. But it is meant to be that way as the title suggests. It is of extreme interest to see how Alexander "Zul-Quarnain's" story has remained vividly alive in the various conquered regions of old and how the man and the myth continue to survive to this day.  For a more thorough historical framework and objective discussion, try several well written texts especially the one by Peter Green.  The books and the movie will paint a much more complete view of the most distinguished military man in history. Thoughout, one must remember to judge him as a man of his time and not ours.
