Just a quick note to answer the "Why should I pre-order?" question.

I woke up this morning, Saturday the 20th, with my brand-spanking-new DVD waiting for me 3 days before Wal-Mart will have it.

They don't charge you until they ship it, and if the price goes down before ship date, you get the discount refunded to you.

Honestly, what more could you ask for?

A side note; I wasn't able to access the digital copy online, since the release date isn't till Tuesday.

Now, if you're curious about this specific title, I gave it four out of five stars because though I enjoyed it, I could see how people who didn't know anything about the Crime Syndicate before they saw this might not be able to relate to them.  I think it was worth it just for the Batman vs. Owlman stuff, and pre-ordered it the moment i heard James Woods was going to do Thomas Wayne, Jr.

The next one is "Batman - Under the Red Hood."  It can't come soon enough for me.
