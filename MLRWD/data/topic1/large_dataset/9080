I'll keep it short and sweet;

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKMZ">Vanilla Sky</a> deserves the five star rating.  If you are really into movies, then this one ranks among a small handful of must-see modern movies. Movie-lovers will adore the film; especially the mesmerizing chemistry between Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. The two may not be best known for their acting, but in Vanilla Sky it doesn't matter because their love affair was not an act.  When wholeheartedly viewing this film, the very real attraction, love, and desire between the two can be felt - stirring the viewer's emotions and drawing one into the depths of the movie with an amplified appreciation of the story, characters, and themes.

Vanilla Sky is a carefully crafted work of art - upon first glance many find the film distasteful and confusing.  However, with further study many viewers begin to see the magnificence of the work and are moved.  Because appreciation for the greatness of the movie is often only developed over several viewings, this quality likely came at the cost of lackluster box-office sales and mediocre initial reviews.  Nevertheless, the intricate details and  powerful themes woven within the story are there to discover, and give the film a depth and longevity that a typical movie does not have.  Credit must be given to director Cameron Crowe.

The most appreciated things in life do not come to us easily, don't watch this movie only once, you will likely never cherish the greatness of the film.

For the same reasons, this remake is superior to the original, Abre los ojos (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LZOD">Open Your Eyes</a>).

Also highly noteworthy is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005S8MF">Vanilla Sky soundtrack</a>, with great artists such as, R.E.M., Radiohead, Paul McCartney, Peter Gabriel, The Monkees, Sigur Ros, Bob Dylan, The Chemical Brothers, and more.
