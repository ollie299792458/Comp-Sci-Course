Who hasn't heard of Snow White? A Classic ever since Grimm included it in his legendary Fairy Tales. The simple tale of a wicked Queen who, because of being jealous of the beauty of Snow White, forces her to flee her palace home and find refuge in a cottage deep in the forest. The cottage is home for a group of disparate little people who work in a mine in the forest. The cottage is in a shambolic shape - which Snow White puts right. The little people and Snow White live idyllically - until the Queen tracks her down and poisons her with an apple. Much sadness ensues, until a handsome Prince arrives and, with a kiss, revives the drugged Snow White.

The scenes, in and of the forest, are simply magnificent. No wonder that Walt Disney became a household word and his new form of cinematography became so world famous that it survives long after his death.  Snow White started a cinematographic genre. Long may children be absolutely delighted and thrilled by it.

This DVD is as close to perfection as I have ever come across.
