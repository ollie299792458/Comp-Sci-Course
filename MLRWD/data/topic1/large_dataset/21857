Stuart Little is one of the best family films and it is a must in your video or dvd collection. The movie runs at 84 minutes. This is a rare live action movie (with very little swear words), there are about 4 swear words. Now if all the swear words was cut fromn this movie (I believe this movie would have gotten a G rating) in less it is rated PG for something else. And you as a parent would have to cover you child(ren)'s ears. As the movie opens, with Mr. Little (Hugh Laurie) and Mrs. Little (Geena Davis) are about to adopt a younger brother for George Little (Jontathan Lipnicki). They come back with a mouse name Staurt Little (voiced by Michael J. Fox). And the family cat named Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane) is embrassed that is new owner is a mouse. And more embrassed if the street cats learn that his new owner is a mouse, so he decides to eat him, but Mr. Little and Mrs. Little make Snowbell drop him, and both warn Snowbell if Stuart Little is harmed, Snowbell will lose his house. George comes home, and gets diappointed to find his new brother is a mouse. Mr. and Mrs. Little threw a party for Stuart and of course other family members are expecting a child and they give presents like a bowling ball and a baseball. Now how is Stuart supposed to throw a baseball or roll a bowling ball.
