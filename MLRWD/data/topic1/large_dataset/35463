Premise: Two American couples on vacation in Central America meet up with a German backpacker and head out into the jungles to find the German's brother at a newly discovered Mayan ziggurat. Once there, they unintentionally step onto the vines growing on the ruins. The locals show up and refuse to let the travelers leave, quickly causing them to retreat to the top of the ruins where the bad events commence. The forced isolation causes the characters to become less rational. The ending is predictable but the alternate ending was better.

I have not read the book but have gathered enough info about it that some evidently important details were left out of the movie. Okay, for the movie: well shot, some beautiful scenes, moderate amount of tension, scare factor was low for me, and the best performance is by Laura Ramsey. The "bad guys" are the unassuming plant life vines coating the ruins which is a bit disturbing. The performances are limited (especially Eric's {Shawn Ashmore}) and the characters are flat with the exception of the breakdown of Stacy (Ramsey). For the most part, the gore in the film is actually well done and the injuries are largely caused by the main characters rather than the vines which are basically reactionary like a venus flytrap... rather cool.

The Unrated DVD is well nothing special. Limited special features including the building of the set, art departments creation of the vines, effects on the blood & gore, and the commentary. Then there are three deleted scenes and two other endings, the 'alternate ending' that was "never before seen" is better but may not have worked well enough in theatres. Overall, The Ruins is worth watching but in a few weeks or months you will forget about this movie unless you're a big fan of it.
