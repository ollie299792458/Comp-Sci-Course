This was a really awesome movie. I had the opportunity to catch it when it went in theaters for one night only, and it was well worth it (My friend and I actually cosplayed as Light and L). The dubbing was surprisingly good, with only a few awkward moments, and all in all, it was a very tense and gripping movie.

I loved how they stuck to the original ending (Won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it) from the manga and anime, even if they had to cut out an entire second season due to time constraints. I would've liked to have seen the psychological play between Light, Near, and Mello, but to be fair, the second season was dialogue-heavy, with not quite as many action sequences.

I only had one real gripe with the movie, and that was the character of Rem. The CGI was impressive and all, but what peeved me was the fact that in the movie, the shinigami was male. In both manga and anime forms, Rem was a female; I'll admit that it was rather unclear in the manga, but just watch a few episodes of the anime after Rem is introduced, and it's pretty clear.

All in all a fantastic continuation from the first Death Note film.
