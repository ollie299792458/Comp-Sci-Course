I was exhilarated when I found out that they were releasing this show on DVD.  I was a large fan of the show back when Fox would air reruns (we never had cable at our old house).  I was truly addicted.

I have never bought a season of a show, mainly because I think I'd get sick of the show too quickly, but I decided to change the rules and buy this one.  Being an anthology series, I thought it would be easier to re-watch over and over again.

Sadly, some of these episodes are better left to the memory.  I could remember "Dig that Cat", "Collection Completed", and "And All Through the House" quite vividly because those stories were very well executed and well written.  Sadly as I rewatched the show, it's not quite as well as I remembered it...plus since I was watching the edited versions on Fox, I was not fully prepared to see all of the gore, nudity, etc.  The most gory episodes are "Lover Come Hack to Me" and "And All Through the House."

Overall, this is a great series, and it is worth buying on DVD.  Unfortunately, Warner Bros. made the mistake of releasing this as a season one package only.  There are only 6 episodes (and I won't go into detail about the episodes since just about every other reviewer did anyway).  Warner Bros. should have combined both season one and two together all at once.  $22 is too much for a 6-episode season.

Other than the episodes, there is a new opening from the cryptkeeper...and right away I realized that after this show was cancelled, the studio probably tossed all of their Cryptkeepers out in the trash.  How do I know this?  Well in the new introduction, he's wrapped up in bandages in a hospital claiming he had botox!  What gives with that?  We never even saw his face!

Overall, I'm more excited about the second season over this one.  This one was good, but a little much for only 6 episodes.  Give it a few weeks and let the price drop...then buy it.
