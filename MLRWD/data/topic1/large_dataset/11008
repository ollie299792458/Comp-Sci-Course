I bought this dvd for my 6 month old several months ago. I had no experience whatsoever with American Sign Language, but I knew that I couldn't wait to communicate with my daughter. At that time, she wasn't interested in the dvd. Now, at 15 months old, she LOVES Signing Time! It's the only movie or t.v. that she watches, and it holds her attention. We both have learned so much together. Not only does she now know about 30 signs, but I do too! (Some of the signs are from another dvd from the series.) The dvd strikes me as simple (but in a really good way,) and very easy to learn for both children and adults. The songs are well done and very catchy. The animation that is done is clever and visually pleasing. Rachel Coleman is excellent and so sincere that she is a pleasure to watch. I like the balance that this dvd has: It's very educational, very lighthearted, and there is some animation, but nothing overwhelming. The signs that are taught are signs my daughter and I use every day all day.
