This movie is based loosely on real events that took place after world war 1. Joseph Pulitzer, owner of The World raised prices of his newspapers that go to the newsboys.  They are disappointed by this fact and decide to go on strike. The boys have to unite or not be herd. They are lead by a fellow named Jack Kelly. A boy with a questionable past, but talent for speaking and rousing the others.

 This movie is very obviously for one audience. It is a song and dance musical, targeted at younger kids. It fails to hold the interest of its older viewers. Most of the characters are fairly flat and develop very little if at all.  Only the two main characters, Jack and Dave, change throughout the movie.

 The actions of the characters steadily get less and less endearing, finally becoming flat out annoying. The song `Sante Fe' drags on coercing the audience closer to suicide than to moving to New Mexico. Just when things are getting better, they slap you in the face with a cookie cutter Disney ending, just so you wouldn't forget that everything has to turn out happily ever after.

 In short, this movie is fun for kids and at least a new storyline for adults tired of the same talking animals and princesses. If you take it at face value (and have a little nap during `Santa Fe') you can see why this film is mildly amusing.
