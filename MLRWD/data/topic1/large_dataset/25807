I'm writing an ongoing review of the program so can get my feedback as I go along. Today I did the first disc (cardio) and I loved it! I really liked that the setup is realistic. You don't have models showing off their perfect bodies during the video who are fake smiling; you have four regular people that are working out with you. Each person demonstrates a level... other videos show you once and then you forget or if you realize halfway through the workout you need to adjust your level. I also liked that they write out at the bottom of the screen the work out you're doing and what is coming up next. It also has a time countdown which helped me with allocating how hard I could workout without overdoing it (so I could last the whole workout time.

I really like the people in the video.It's fun and they all seem relatable and not scripted. The before and after picture area on the calendar they give you I feel is going to help me see progress and remind me of my goals when I'm getting lazy or I'm trying to convince myself that I'm too busy to work out that day or that I'm not seeing instantaneous results.

Well, I'll keep you posted as I go along. Hope this helps!
