I was shocked at how good this movie is.  At first, I scoffed at the idea of Tom Selleck playing Ike.  I was totally wrong.  He did a fantastic job.  The casting for this movie was superb.  The acting was also very very good, as was the screenplay.  The movie covers the period when Ike is first named "Supreme Commander", in charge of the entire European theater, to the D-Day invasion.  The movie starts out with Ike speaking with Winston Churchill.  They debate over the idea of having one "supreme commander" calling the shots in Europe.  Churchill goes on to say that no one in history has held that much power as he would have, not Alexander, Napoleon or Caesar. It's hard to disagree with that statement. The movie explores the decision making that took place in planning D-Day.  You really get a feel for the immense responsibility that Eisenhower had with running the War and keeping the Allies together.  Not only did he have war strategy to deal with, he also had to keep egomaniacs, like Monty and Charles de Gaulle, happy. No easy task, to be sure.  This is a great movie, don't miss it.
