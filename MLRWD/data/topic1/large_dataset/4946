Julien and Sophie are two precocious, adorable children who grow into two beautiful but severely immature and hedonistic adults. The dare game they play with the candy tin is but a device they use to torment each other, as they are clearly in love. Only when one of them is holding it can anything close to real feelings be revealed, and even these are subject to the rules of the game.

Theirs is a doomed relationship--as is any relationship our heroes enter into with anyone--because both Julien and Sophie are destructive, damaged, and dysfunctional...but (mostly) in a way that is funny and engaging to watch. Other reviewers have complained about the characters' inability to show empathy for others, but "Love Me if You Dare" isn't about other people, it's about the relationship of Julien and Sophie, the way it consumes and dictates the course of their lives. Anyone else who appears in the film is peripheral and is to be discarded thoughtlessly, as the writers obviously did.

Although at times it is hard to root for these two train wrecks of human beings, it is often harder not to. They are, after all, beautiful, charismatic, and in love.

A note on the subtitles: they often lack the passion of what the character is saying. In one scene, Sophie is upbraiding Julien, giving him a severe talking-to, and calling him every awful name in the book. The subtitles don't reflect this; instead, they say something like, "you're kind of a bad guy." As Sophie, Marion Cotillard lights up the screen and has a presence that cannot be described. She is luminous. The bright colors in the film are dazzling. "Love Me if You Dare" is a gorgeous film to behold.
