Wow! I read all the reviews here and am stymied. Having worked in television and film, and as a journalist/critic, I have to preface my remarks with a little proverb: "it is what it is." This film makes no pretenses. It is a girl-kicks-ass, action flick, not wholly unlike Gena Davis'The Long Kiss Goodnight. All this talk about character and story development....balderdash! How much backstory do we get in early Bond flicks? It is formulaic and we dig that we know what to expect: action, action and more action....then there is the sex, but, in this, Salt is her own sex symbol, so why muddy up the waters with a token, male piece of ass.
The first act, where she runs from the CIA, after being exposed as a Russian mole, is pretty intense, action-wise. If you take nine minutes to watch the video on making the film (available on Video-On-Demand for free) you will see that Jolie is into the physicality of the stunt work.....and does she get to play here!
Although the slim storyline is reminiscent of Bond films, it is the incredibility of the stunts that make it exceptional. There is little or no method acting involved, all physical. Dialog is almost non-existent. But, of course....it's not about wooing the viewer, but, rather, getting the viewer to grip the edge of their seat.
Yes, it is open-ended, but with the Bourne Trilogy don't we ask ourselves WWJD (What would Jason do?). Here, I wonder, as always mystified, WWJD (What will Jolie Do?), and as always, I am pleased as punch (pun intended).
