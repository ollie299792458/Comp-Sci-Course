...the wardrobe department from this movie! Man! Ultra high tube socks! Midriff baring T-shirts(for the guys!)! Super high and tight shorts!(also for the guys! let's sing Soprano!)
But really, from the opening scene, you know you are in for one sweet and (unintentionally)funny ride. If you haven't seen it, let me go over the very beginning.
Hair helmet sporting lifeguard lends boat to cute but inattentive girl. Both fail to hear pleas from the waterskiing
girl(who no doubt gradutated from the William Shatner school of acting) who has spotted a man and his two children in the water after capsizing their boat. From the ultra fake body which gets run over to the lament filled utterance "John" by the man's "significant other" to the girl screaming so loudly you would think she was the one who was run over...I haven't laughed this hard in a while.
And it gets better after that.
Witness the obscenity filled male softball game with players in the ranging in the ages of 9 to 25!
Witness men walking around in their underwear alot more than they should at a camp for little kids!
Witness the girl who gets hit by a water ballon drop like she has just been shot!
Witness Mel(who looks like a crack addicted Norman Fell) put on the most dramatic performance of 1983!
You think Johnny and gang from the Karate Kid were mean? Check out this gang!(Guys and Girls!)
Shockingly funny ending! I won't give it away here, but it just seems like it fits with the rest of the weirdness of the film.
Get some beer, get some friends, enjoy the campiness.
