From a former Military guy, I am always picking apart the finer details concerning military tactics and actions in movies.  I did not have these issues with this movie.  I read other reviews that noted the poor acting.  I would like to point out that the acting is poor in the softer moments of the movie.  However the acting in the action sequences is just fine.  That is where these guys are good and it shows.  They may not be good at pretending, but they are great at the real thing.  I would like to see more movies made with real soldiers.  I can do without the real actors, and would prefer the real thing.  Not a movie that an overpaid Hollywood actor could have pulled off as good as these guys did.  And besides, when the Hollywood actors are getting rewarded at the Oscars, Emmy's, whatever, for their pretending. Stop and think for a moment where these guys are for real at that same moment.  If they even receive an award for the real thing, their awards ceremony will not be televised.  So heres to the SEAL teams, the Navy in general, the Air Force, Coast Guard, Army, and of course Marines everywhere, keep up the good work, you are the real heroes.  You deserve more than the actors do.
