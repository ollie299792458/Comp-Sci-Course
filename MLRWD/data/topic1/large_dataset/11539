Well That was precisely what Jack Bauer wanted to do for the rest of his tourmented life. Unfortunatly for him but fortunatly for us he is forced back in action for this Prequel to Season 7 of one of the most suspensful TV series ever.

The change of location was a plus to me (The movie all takes place in Africa and Washington DC) and I loved the new characters (the kids are very good, Jon Voight I love).

I want to add that the soundtrack was much better than usual (the woman vocalization adds a little sentiment to the regular suspense and synthetiser music) and is really beautiful on the sad parts of the show!

The photography is excellent and as the movie was actually shot is africa they really took advantage of that.

As they added about 10 extra minutes to the TV episode I'll run to buy this DVD to enjoy the show even more!

And of course I just can't wait for January and the real begining of season 7 hoping it will be as good as the 2nd and 5th (which were the best to my taste, but what do I know I am French after all! hehe!)

Good luck Jack and may CTU be with you! : )
