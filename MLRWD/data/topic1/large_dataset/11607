"Chicago" definitely deserved to sweep at the Oscars last year.  I was especially happy it won Best Picture.  This was one of my favorite movies of 2002. 
Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweiger) is an aspiring Vaudeville star who shoots her lover, then ends up in jail with her idol, singer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  With the help of the slick, slimy Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), the women try to get out of jail and return to showbiz.
Though Renee Zellwieger was very good, I thought Catherine Zeta-Jones did the best job in this movie.  When the two sang and danced together, Zeta-Jones was the one I couldn't keep my eyes off of.  She's a trained dancer and singer, so with this film, she was completely in her element.  She definitely deserved the Best Supporting Actress Oscar.
My favorite songs/dance numbers included: "All That Jazz," "Mr. Cellophane," "Cell Block Tango," "We Both Reached For the Gun," and "Nowadays."  The song and dance numbers were cleverly done so that they were in Roxie's head, if you don't like the idea of musicals with people randomly bursting into song and dance.  Go rent it today, I strongly recommend it!
