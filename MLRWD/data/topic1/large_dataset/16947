Since I just gave my review in the title, I will say that it could be improved by giving us an entire season at a time. Some commentaries would be nice too, though I don't know anyone relevant to the show that's still alive.

In this second half of the first season, these were my favorite episodes-
Search in a Windy City-Kimble comes face to face with the one armed man- in a moment of frustration and anxiety.
Angels Travel on Lonely Roads-2 parter-I didn't expect the concept of Kimble traveling with a nun would be this entertaining  , with some genuine light hearted moments .
Bloodline- Kimble's love for animals carries this episode -you can't go wrong with dogs.

Every episode is worth watching. At times, it can get somewhat heavy handed, and turgid. The Homecoming, and Storm Center,are 2 of the not so great episodes.

While I'm glad they didn't overuse Gerard-this half season underuses him. He's only relevant in 2 episodes, appears in 1 or 2 others briefly. If they put out complete seasons, it wouldn't be so noticeable.
