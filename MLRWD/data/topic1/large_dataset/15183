I have always enjoyed John Wayne's 1960 version of the Alamo even though it was historically inaccurate. Disney has made a nobel effort to get it right! They re-created San Antonio accurately in time with 1836.

I enjoyed the film, but I must admit constantly comparing it to the 1960 version. The films have their own agendas. Wayne's film was very patriotic and heroic as compared to the Disney's darker and more stark version.

I was very impressed with Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of David Crockett. His performance seemed more authentic than the Duke. My favorite scene was Crockett playing his fiddle in defiance to Santa Anna's army band. Billy Bob's Crockett was in self-conflict trying to live up to his super-human legend. John Wayne's Crockett was comfortable with his legend status.

I felt the battle scenes leading to the fall of the Alamo seemed to be short as compared to John Wayne's version. The 1960 film exploited the overwhelming odds against the defenders with tension building up day by day. Disney's film just showed them suddenly being attacked during nightfall without any cinematic build up.

Of course, the big difference was John Wayne's heroic death scene compared to Billy Bob's Crockett being captured and executed!

Overall, I thought "The Alamo" was a very good film even with it's flaws.
