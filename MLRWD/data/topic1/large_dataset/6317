"Pet Sematary" is my all-time favorite book, so in 1989 when the film came out, I couldn't WAIT to see it. The first time I watched it (covering my eyes most of the time), the movie terrified me. The sets and characters are quite true to the book (Fred Gwynne WAS Jud Crandall), and the music was just as I had imagined it would be like. Also the Zelda character I still can't watch today- she was really scary. I couldn't sleep for a week.

I went to see it again with my eyes OPEN during the "scary" parts, and was crushed to discover that even with Stephen King adapting his own book to the screen, the movie STANK. The makeup was overdone way past "over the top", and the Pascow character was so creepy, yet they screwed that up with making him a comic. And lastly, since when does a two year old who's been run down by a Mack truck only have a cut on his forehead to show for it??!

I guess if you've never read the book, you might find the movie entertaining, but as someone who's always treasured this story, I agree with a previous reviewer when I say this movie should never have been made. There are too many things in the book you just can't transfer to the screen; it should have been left up to our individual imaginations.

Just read the book and scare the hell out of yourself.
