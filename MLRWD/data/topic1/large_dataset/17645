Im a professional actor and I'm particuraly critical of most of the "product" that's churned out by the Movie and TV industry, and I can tell you, this series Dawson's Creek is truly exceptional.

I purchased the whole series from Amazon, and although Dawson's Creek has had it's not so great moments; 'the occasional episode was fairly mediocre', overall each season ended on a fine note. The writing is superb, the acting, especially by James Van Der Beek and Joshua Jackson is flawless, and the overall atmosphere enhanced by the superb music and directing is captivating. The series is universal, in that any age range will find it fascinating. Dawson's creek will leave an unforgettable impression on you.

One down side is the end of the series. It's almost as if the producers and writers literally gave up at the last episode. As a result don't expect a series conclusion where the series ends with a bang, instead expect it to end with a whimper, because it ends that way.

As to why that happened is beyond me, and very dissapointing. That aside you will be doing yourself a disservice if you don't see this show.
