This is a very interesting movie, worth watching. An American WWII movie where  the Germans are positively described and moreover, the hero is a young German POW. Since I'm Mexican, I was very surprised at this fact, because all American war movies I had watched till now had this arrogant portray of the Americans as world saviors. Not this one. It's also outstanding for its locations; shut on the postwar ruined Europe, it has an incredible sense of realism and war weariness. Especially noteworthy is the last 10 minutes sequence when the undercover German "traitors" and the American officer escape ... will they make it? Will the Germans reveal all the plan to their countrymen? Oscar Werner is extraordinary as well as the actor playing the other German spy (sorry, I didn't catch the actor's name).  The script is not so good with the American soldiers portrayal; even my beloved Richard Basehart is quite wooden and declaiming his final lines as a recruiting TV ad for the Marines. Highly recommended for WWII movie fans!
