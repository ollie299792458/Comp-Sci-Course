I just finished watching Smurfs with my kids in the movie theater and definitely recommend it to children agest 7-12.  To properly rate this movie, I'll comment on it from the standpoint of "should you take your kids to see it?"  The movie itself is good with an easy storyline to follow.  Gargamel wants to capture the "essence" of the Smurfs so he can be the besdt magician in the world. To do that, he needs to capture one of the Smurfs and the movie goes about telling the story of how he tries to do that.  I thought that a child under the age of 7 will likely not get all the innuendos and may even be scared at certain points in the movie--especiall of Gargamel.  12 year old on the other hand are about at the ceiling where they would find the movie funny and entertaining. There are definitely some good jokes that even adults would like--but not enough to recommend it solely for adults who want to see it themselves (although curiously there are always adults in this sort of movie--I kind of wonder why?)  A good flick that is about the right length for kids to sit through with some good action and funny moments.
