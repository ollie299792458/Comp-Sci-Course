A terrific DVD... great picture, sound, and everything is well organized.  And you actually get a lot more than the rubber wrap-around outer box says you get... the outer package says you get 120 minutes of cartoons, but in reality you get a very generous 360 minutes (the actual DVD box lists the correct running time).  Also, some readers have observed that the opening and closing credits are different or revised from the original broadcasts.  I don't know about those folks, but the credits seem to be exactly as I remembered them as a kid... the theme song, incidental music, what you see, etc. (for example, the closing credits have all the main characters driving old cars that slowly evolve into more modern ones, just as I remember from when I was a kid).  Perhaps there were different credits in different markets, or the credits changed in later episodes, I don't know.  Anyway, the stories hold up very well, and are still very entertaining for the adult me.  They all have a great combination of thrills, adventure, whimsical humor, and great imagination (remember the "Mammoth Car"?)  In any event, if it isn't clear already, this disc is highly recommended for anyone with a more than passing interest in the world of Speed Racer.
