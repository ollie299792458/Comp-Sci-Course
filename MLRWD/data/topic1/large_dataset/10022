A lot of factual in this comprehensive documentary which will arm every citizen who watches it against the lies being spewed by those who want to deceive Americans in order to gain their votes by fraud.  Americans are being lulled into believing the lies that reliance on foreing oil will be reduced by any significant amount and that gas/oil prices will be reduced by offshore and arctic drilling - and Americans are desperate enough to believe such lies without question, without wanting to listen to the unappetizing truth that we use over 25% of the world's oil while we possess less than 4% of oil reserves. The mathematics show the truth, that drilling all the 5% total reserves would not even put a dent in our dependence on foreign oil nor prices,  but the cynics know voters want hope even when a lie.  The cynics know the reality and the truth will be face well AFTER the elections!!!  Meanwhile, the old policies that got us into this mess will prevail, and contunue until the reality of depletion arrives for us to face, still dependent on foreign oil and still UNPREPARED!!  And this deplection will be happening within the lifetime of our children, this has been well documented by both oil companies and governments, who withhold this coming catastrophe from the public!!!!
