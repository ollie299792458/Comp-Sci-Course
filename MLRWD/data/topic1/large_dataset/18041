Mere words can not describe this movie.  It is a shame that America 'has to' edit these wonderous anime shows and movies.  I bought the uncut, original, japanese version of  Sailor Moon R with the english subtitling.  It was great.  I personally give this movie a  perfect rating.  Purchase  this movie along with Sailor Moon S and Sailor Moon SuperS in the uncut  japanese versions.  I did.  Whatever you do, DO NOT purchase the American  version of  Sailor Moon R.(It has been un-nessecarily editted) The language  is not that bad, the violence  is nothing, and the nudity....Well, this  country has a problem with nudity for some stupid reason.  The fact is,  there is nothing wrong with nudity.  Anyway, I would estimate a total of  about a whopping five seconds of nudity in the whole movie, if even that.  In any case, get the Japanese version.  Let's let America know we won't  take any more of there pointless, and  totally senseless editing of Japan's  Anime masterpieces.  Buy the Sailor Moon R movie now. Trust me, if you like  Sailor Moon now, You will love her after watching this one.
