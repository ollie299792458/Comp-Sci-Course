This is the fourth version of the movie I've owned (VHS, w/s VHS, Criterion, MGM special edition).  And DVD is better than VHS so let's forget about those ancient relics known as tapes.
If you just want to watch the movie, the MGM edition is best.  It has the 5.1 sound, and the picture is much nicer.  However, the Criterion does offer a lot more insight into the film.  Criterion has a commentary track with Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster, Jonathan Demme &amp; Ted Tally, and the FBI agent that Jack Crawford was based on.  I found this to be very interesting and it really let you understand the film better.
Although the MGM edition's deleted scenes fill in some holes (the John Hopkin's help, that card Clarice is holding when calling Crawford, etc.) the scenes are far too short and only show excerpts from what were probably full scenes.  Criterion's deleted scenes, again, help you gain a different perspective on the film.
MGM has a solid documentary about the movie, but Criterion has those direct quotes from actual serial killers.  The choice is a tough one to make.  Personally, I'm glad I have both.
