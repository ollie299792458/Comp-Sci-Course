Friends Season 8 is the best Friends season out of all 10, Believe me you will NOT FIND FUNNIER! There are so many highlights in this season!!!!!!!!

Anyway, in Season Eight BIG THINGS happen!

Monica and Chandler begin their first year of married life AND Rachel is pregnant............. and to Ross!

This is the first and only Friends Season to win the ''prestigious'' OUTSTANDING COMEDY SERIES EMMY. It deserves it too!

I didn't think I would like this DVD ,but it turns out its my favourite and a lot of other peoples favourite too.

Basically if you can have only ONE Friends Season, it has to be Season 8!

This is going to be very difficult but

My Personal Top 5 Episodes ARE:

The One with the Videotape

The One with the Rumor

The One with the Birthing Video

The One with the Baby Shower

The One Where Rachel Is Late

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~and OK one more!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The One Where Rachel Has the Baby~

The final verdict is, you wont find a better bunch of episodes and you WILL be laughing for hours. BUY SEASON EIGHT. ITS THE BEST IN ALL 10 YEARS OF THE SHOW!
