'Logan's Run' is a great film about the city of a fascistic society in the future where no one is allowed to live past 30, instead they are transformed into dead people by a futuristic lightshow celebrated by the town's inhabitants.  The society is controlled by a 'Brave New World' type Bacchanal government, which means you can do what you want, but at 30, make way for others like a good citizen.  No one knows that they are actually killed, however.
Logan decides he don't play that game, and goes on the lam with a girl, finding his way outside and past a cheesy robot that likes to store running people as food.  The robot is humorous in a 'Black Hole' sort of way, but probably the film's only low point.
The special effects surpass previous 70's sci-fiers (aside from '2001').  This film is perhaps more poignant today than when it was made in the 70's, when now it appears our American society is used to the Bacchanal mind control that was merely in its infancy when this film was made.
