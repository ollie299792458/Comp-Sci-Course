I can't tell you how much my family loves this movie.  I have two girls aged 3 & 6 1/2 and they request it at least once a week.  Of all the cinderalla versions (50's, 60's & Disney) this one is the most heartwarming.  The prince is not arrogant like in the 1960's version.  The Princess is not blonde and white as in all other versions.  The step-sisters are more laughable than evil as in the 50's version.  And the step-mother is less evil and more bitter.  She "has changed" since the death of Cinderella's father (for all of us who wonder why he married her in the first place).  She just seems to want her daughters married off and they are so funny in their extremes.  Tall, skinny and snorty and short, chubby and itchy.  The prince is truly kind and handsome and really wants to find love, not just someone to produce an heir as in the 60's version.  I highly recommend this.  The singing is beautiful, the songs are timeless and the money spent for scenery is very evident.  It doesn't look like a play on stage like the 60's version with the cardboard trees and campy effects.  This one is truly pleasing to the eye.  Enjoy!
