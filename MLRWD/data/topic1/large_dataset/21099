This is easily Kevin Bacon's finest. His performance is Oscar worthy. This film inspired me when I was a young legal student. It had been sometime since I have seen the movie. A friend of mine had borrowed the movie and kept it for a good year. I had first bought this movie via a laser disc. Thereafter when the DVD came out, I paid over US 25 for it. 
Here the performances are solid. I am sure many have written about how great the movie it. As such the purpose of my review is to focus what this show means to me. This movie explores the importance of the client solicitor relationship. The show begins with Young being very alienated to Slater's character. This is shown by the director's careful photography angles. It somehow seems to convey that one has to enter into someone's prison to get another out. It cleverly shows that not only Young was in prison but Slater's character also. This is clearly pointed out when he (the lawyer) chose to enter his (Young) cell. It cleverly shows that he was a slave to the legal system and to the footsteps of his brother brilliant played as always by Douriff. 
It was clearly a battle that not only Young had to fight but one that Stamphill had to fight as well. Hence trust had to be developed. The story captures a solicitor's need to win his clients confidence. It also deals with situations when the client's instructions are clearly against his advice.
My favourite scene is when the judge reprimanded Young and said; "This is my court. I am the one who says whether is OK or not OK". Then staring at Young he asks "OK?" Now that is brilliant. Well done, Marc Rocco. You have won a fan. Can't wait for a director's cut with 5.1 sound to come out.
