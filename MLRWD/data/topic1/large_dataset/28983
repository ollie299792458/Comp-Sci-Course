Wow - our family received a special treat this weekend when the USPS mailman delivered a preview copy of Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition Combo Pack.  The classic story of a beautiful princess and her haunting struggle of good and evil never grows weary - the 1937 animation remains a treasure as the audience sings, cheers, wishes and dreams for their own "happily ever after"!

For the first time in seven years, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment has reopened their vaults to release "The One That Started It All" and this edition features high-definition Blu-ray as well as the DVD in one package.  This premieres tomorrow - Tuesday, October 6th, 2009 and launches their all-new product line, Disney's Diamond Collection, with the highest quality and immersive experience to date overflowing with lots of extras including a music video, Disneyview expanded viewing experience, Disney Family Plan games for everyone to enjoy, Backstage Disney behind the scenes fun of this legendary tale, and Classic Bonus Features including Dopey's Wild Mine Ride Game, Karoke Sing A Long, Hyperion Studios, Magic Mirror hosting, and more!!!  The standard definition version will be released on November 24, 2009.

We had a really special time together cuddled up last night watching the DVD in her room.  It was a cozy and genuine mom-daughter time as we laughed and thrilled throughout the movie.  We had it on video, but this version is far superior in sound, color and picture clarity.

I highly recommend this new package for every family - a true treasure to add to your collection for years to come!
