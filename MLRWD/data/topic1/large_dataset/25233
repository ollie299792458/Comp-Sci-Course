Technically dazzling, this is a movie with an unclear motive - or perhaps it is a film with a cobbling of many diverse messages.  The end result is a tedious movie with unmistakably great moments.

As an educator and parent, I am always concerned with the messages movies convey to children. Among the many messages in this movie: the evil kangaroo woman (a character who wants to save the jungle community from Horton's 'wierd ways') 'Pouch Schools' her little one.  This comes across as a cruel shot at homeschooling. Even global weather change messages are added to this story of a generation ago.  Nevertheless, the time honored original moral comes through: a person's a person no matter how small. Perhaps this salient line could be used as a pro-life slogan!

We endured nearly the entire movie - fast forwarding through the song at the end, etc.. While we loved some of the WhoVille scenes, it is not worth the money in our opinion.  (Also be prepared for a scene in which a character is hit with objects in his front private areas for a notably long time.)
