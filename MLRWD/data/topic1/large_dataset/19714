If you like character studies and beautiful movies, then this film is for you. If you like action at breakneck speeds with no thought to plot or depth, then move along and peddle your wares elsewhere. And I'm not talking about ALL action movies. I like action movies. But I watch them with the same emotional attachment as I have to my Wii--entertaining and fluffy, but I'm not invested one way or the other. Very occasionally a movie comes along that so impresses me with its craftmanship I am awestruck. This is one of those movies.

For those of you said something along the lines of "Brad Pitt sucked" then you were not paying attention. His performance is nothing short of amazing. He is menacing and threatening using almost no physicality at all. Even his voice is evenly modulated. But his face and his eyes...wow. Chills. And Casey Affleck is a revelation in this film. Not to mention some of the most beautiful cinematography I've ever seen.

If you liked No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood, then I think you'll like this too. If you liked Transformers and Crank, then don't bother.
