If a faithful rendition of a great work of world literature, maintains the qualities that make reading the book memorable, without having to slavishly reproduce every scene, then this is one. Compare this effort with the more recent American version to see what a magnificent piece of film this is.  Depardieu is magnificent; he delivers a stream of often complicated lines with great lucidity without glossing over their moral dimensions. As an aside, they must have rounded up every first rate show horse in France (with priceless tack in period and a parking lot filled with elegantly restored carriages--- it earns 5 stars as a horse show) for this visual delight; The acting is uniformly strong; the locations exceptional, the women beautiful.  I would say many more wonderful things, if  were getting paid by the word, but suffice to say that for anyone who loves the book yet fears what moviemakers might make of it, fear not. This is a visual and literary delight. For criticism: the quality of the DVD could be better and the subtitles can't be made to go away. This follows the general assumption that no one in zone one has sufficient French to live without inept translation cluttering the screen... WRONG. Relative to the massive enjoyment this production provided to me, those are quibbles not criticism... Joey Tranchina
