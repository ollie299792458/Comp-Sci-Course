Great movie, but this review is for the misunderstood Criterion DVD.

Many reviews complain about the picture quality, and no wonder; it's scratchy, grainy and all that they say. Also, the contrast is high, so details get lost. However, from reels of THE SCARLET EMPRESS, you get two choices: clear but slightly cropped, especially on the top and left, or scratchy but uncropped. You can see the former on TCM, but Criterion chose the latter. Tough choice, but I would have, too. Just think: maybe they helped preserve the picture's edges for the future. If Criterion explained this picture issue, they'd be cut some slack. Instead, they just wrote, "Luminous new digital transfer, with restored image."

As for extras, there's a 20-minute documentary about Von Sternberg, but not his career; he's only adjusting lights in 1966, saying things any filmmaker could say. It's rare to hear him speak, but it doesn't mention his movies or Dietrich. It's kind of boring and uninformative. The other extra is a slideshow of the actors in costume, lobby cards and scenes from the movie. It's great to have for completness' sake. On the inner sleeve is a "Von Sternberg tribute by underground filmmaker Jack Smith," a 2-page praise that doesn't mention THE SCARLETT EMPRESS.

Back to the movie: this is a great presentation. Just know, it's the scratchy-but-uncropped version.
