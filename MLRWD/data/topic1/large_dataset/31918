This is a really good dvd set. It has all the episodes, plus the halarious ova. Both japanese and english dubs, and for those who like english dubs, I took a look at this show's and it was pretty good, I'd still suggest to watch it japanese. I didn't really take a look at the special features in this collection other than the trailers, but there are quite a few listed. The biggest selling point for me was the booklets in this set. It comes with 4 booklets that contain a bunch of information on most all the characters, the story, and several other things. I found them to be fun to read through. It doesn't take up much shelf space, only the size of about 2 dvd cases. The case itself is pretty neat too. It's the only case I have like this where there is 2 dvd's in view but they're actually sitting on a flap that lifts to reveal the other 2. Hard to describe but interesting when you see it.

When it comes to the show itself, I really liked the first season because it had the story line, unlike fumoffu which was also great for a comedy, to it and I was wanting more after, so this series was perfect. It has a more serious story line to it, with the needed comedy as well. The show reveals more about the characters, and there is a nice little appearance from the stars of Deathnote. I think if you liked the first season, you'll love this one. I'd definetly recommend anyone to buy this.
