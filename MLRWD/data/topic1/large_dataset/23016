This is a review of the Blu ray 15th Anniversary edition of Apollo 13.  The movie is a masterpiece.  But, Universal's Blu-ray release leaves something to be desired.

As others have said, it takes a long time to load.  I have a Samsung Blu-ray player that's less than a year old.  The player has the latest firmware and a broadband connection.  The movie takes a full four minutes to load.  Then, most of the time there is no play menu.  Instead, it goes into infinite loop - running the same few start-up pictures & music.  When this occurs, it's not possible to view the movie.

After 3 tries, the menu finally came up and I was able to watch the film.  That resulted in more frustration.  Because, on my Blu-ray player at least, the viewing mode defaults to U-Control even when it hasn't been selected.  Meaning that there are almost constant pop-ups in the upper left portion of the screen.  Pushing the red button to turn off U-Control doesn't get rid of the pop-ups - U-Control continues to run in the background.  After much frustration, I figured out that I had to go into the little U-Control menu at the bottom right portion of the screen and turn it off.  Pausing the movie reactivates U-Control and the menu has to be accessed again to disable it.  Quite annoying!

The film itself . . . well, some scenes are almost grainy, and I'm not referring to the old black & white news broadcasts.  It's as if Universal chose certain scenes to work on (like lift-off which is gorgeous!) and left the rest untouched.  The visual quality of most of the film has not benefited from the move to Blu-ray.

This is one of my favorite films.  But, if I'd known how frustrating this version would be to watch, I wouldn't have purchased it.
