If you have an interest in fantasy, romance, imagination, originality,  emotion and the spiritual realm then you will love this movie! This is a  beautiful love story about two soulmates, Chris (Robin Williams) and Annie  (Annabella Sciorra).  Tragically, they lose both of their children in a car  accident. Soon afterwards, Chris dies in a car accident as well, leaving  Annie alone bereaved.  Chris comes back, in the Spirit, to try and comfort  his wife.  She can not see or hear him...or can she?
After much suffering  over her loss, Annie commits suicide.  Chris is happy when he is told in  his own private paradise.  But there is a problem.  Annie went to hell  because she "violated the natural order of her journey."  Chris  responds to the terrible news with "I'm her soulmate, I can find  her."  When told he does not understand he replies "it is not  about understanding! It's about NOT giving up!" Chris is determined to  find Annie no matter what the cost. "What Dreams May Come" is  beautiful from start to finish but Chris' search is what touched me the  most. This movie is about agape love--love so pure that it transcends  reason or consequence.  Follow Chris through a journey into the heart of  love.  
This is Robin Williams in one of his best dramatic performances;  a must-have for any fan of his.  Annabella Sciorra is a wonderful actress  and she and Robin successfully portray soulmates.  The script is one of the  best I've ever heard, full of beautiful thought-provoking lines (such as  the title above.)  The cinematography and set design are absolutely  stunning--an astounding Heaven and Hell are depicted better than I've seen  in countless other movies. The soundtrack is deeply moving as well.
I  highly and whole-heartedly recommend this movie!
