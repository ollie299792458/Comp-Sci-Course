I have not seen the original version of this movie, but to me I can tell whats newly put it.  But I believe it totally adds to the film because you can see what had wanted to be shown originally.  Robert Duvall does an amazing job and is probably one of his best performed roles.  The violence and nudity is done in a tasteful manner and really only adds to the story.  But it's funny how different this film is in that context compared to Star Wars which was PG.  Geore Lucas needs to go back to making amazing movies like this.  Although Star Wars is classic, this movie is timeless.  And in our countrys current state, it was rereleased at the perfect time.  And also, the sound is amazing.  You can fully hear the vomit dripping on the floor at the begining of the film when Duvall is in "thearapy", crank the sound higher and it's even more grutesque.  A chilling master piece.  Lucas is the modern Shakespiere for the simple fact that he understands the human mind so completely and shows it and writes it so chillingly clear.
