The title just represents my opinion, but this is without a doubt, one of the best if not the best of the TV mini-series.  This was followed by the all-too-short regular weekly series (also available on dvd) and V - The Final Battle.  And that's the order you want to watch them in - that way everything ties together and you aren't wondering what went on and why something in The Final Battle is happening.

The original though, is still the best.  "Friendly" aliens come to Earth in need of water (supposedly)and we find out they aren't what they seem and it makes for gripping viewing even if you've seen it before.  It even features a young Robert Englund (Freddy Kreuger in Nighmare On Elm Street 1- 102)as a "good" alien.

There are shades of Nazi Germany and the persecution of the Jews running rampant through the series - showing perhaps that what happened once can happen again and it doesn't have to be a madman who's responsible for the genocide taking place.

While it came out over 20 years ago (1983), V is just as gripping and exciting today as it was when it first came out.
