Okay, this review is for the MOVIE - not the version you are looking at.

This movie - along with Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Wolf Man - established Universal as THE horror movie company of the world. These are all ADAPTATIONS of the original story, and because of that, they serve cinimatic needs, rather than literary. If you're wanting the novel, either read that or watch a later treatment. (And there are several.)

Claude Raines is the haunted/hunted man in this version, and I will tell you from the very beginning, the special effect of him unraveling his bandages and revealing NOTHING is - even in this day of supra-CGI special effects - nothing short of spectacular and spine-chillingly real. (Imagine the effect on a 1930's audience, who had never seen such a thing, and you begin to appreciate the cinematic horror this movie engenders, even to this day.)

Universal spent a lot of money making this picture, and the product delivers quite well. The wonderful thing about this movie is that even though H.G. Wells wrote a much longer story, the movie captures the essence perfectly, and delivers you into the world where a man has actually made himself invisible, and the necessary fall-out that accompanied it.

Would you suppose a man having made himself invisible would not only turn to crime, but also to murder? It is the realization of what he has become that drives him over the edge - perfectly rendered by Claude Raines in his performance.

A TRUE horror classic. Exception for its day, and up to the present.
