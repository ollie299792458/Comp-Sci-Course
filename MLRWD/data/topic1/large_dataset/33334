This package includes both the special editions of Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick and also a bonus animated short of what supposedly happened in between the two films. But only the films themselves were the special editions, they had very lackluster and bland menus and lacked chapter selection menus. But other than that, the two full films are very good films and the extra footage are included that makes this a good set to own.

The animated film in between I would have to say is not really worth it. First of all, it's short. The term "Trilogy" is kind of misleading because you think this is another feature film, but it's more like a short film than an actual feature film. It's only about half an hour long and features just one isolated incident that doesn't really tie itself or affect the main plots of either full-length feature films. More like a side story. I thought that it would talk about how they got separated and how the ending of Pitch Black where they leave together turned out to them scattered throughout the galaxy and how the grudge between some of them ignited, but it turns out this short animated film shows none of that. And to be honest, the animation style itself is not that great. It is like the kind of animation from the old MTV Aeon Flux cartoon, which I never liked anyhow.

Overall, the set is a pretty good value as buying the two Special Edition Director's Cut feature films separately would probably cost more and would take up more room in your collection, but don't have too high of expectations to see something new in the Dark Fury animated short. Personally, I would have paid a little more if this included the game Escape from Butcher Bay because that was a much better addition to the series than Dark Fury. But I know packaging DVD's with games is not typically what happens, haha, too bad.
