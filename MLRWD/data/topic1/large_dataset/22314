This film features a very nice cast and an even nicer screenplay creating interest on many levels.  Firstly, the comedy of Wilder and Pryor infuse the suspense filled plot to provide a rich diversity of interest in this film.  Secondly, the film may prove to be bigger than the stars themselves, as an epic of rail travel mystery.  Add to this the romantic underscore, and you have a very unique and entertaining movie.  Jill Clayborn provides a nice supporting role as well as Ned Beatty.

The music score is entrancing and provides a complement to the surprising cinematography of beautiful backdrops of views from the rails.  The plot takes more twists and turns than the rails themselves, leaving the viewer lost in the whole experience.  I'll watch this over and over, if for any reason than that of the adventure of the rail travel itself.

This movie is part love story, police story, murder mystery, and slapstick comedy.  It is somewhat timeless, and has far outlasted (unfortunately) it's featured cast.  Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor never quite were able to capture the chemistry they enjoyed here.  This is truly captivating film that makes you want to watch it over and over again, because you just miss being on the Silver Streak. Pick up a copy and enjoy, it will turn the everyday person into a rail fan, but most importantly, a movie fan.
