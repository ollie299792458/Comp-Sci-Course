I bought this set to use in my oceanography class. I was told about the series by another teacher. In some supplier catalogues, the VHS version of the movies were being sold indivdually for $99- that means $400 for the entire series!!! This was a MUCH better deal, obviously.

I haven't watched all of the material yet but so far I am very impressed. Each segment is about 45-50 minutes long, perfect for watching during a single class period. There are 8 segments (2 per DVD), which gives me a lot to choose from! Additionally there is bonus material. The movies are well-organized, easy to follow, and contain some fantastic footage of undersea life. The narration is very nice. I would highly recommend using these in any oceanography, marine biology or even general biology class.  A lot of the material focuses on the struggle for existance, adaptations, predator-prey relationships, surviving in the absence of sunlight or in extreme environments, etc.

These movies are great for ANYONE who loves the ocean, particularly ocean creatures!
