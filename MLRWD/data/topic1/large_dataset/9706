What a great story. Inspiring. My son loved it. And, it's a true story.
Quaid did an expert job of bringing this story home. Very believable performance. We are Devil Rays fans, so this one had to be true to life for us. We were already familiar with the background....
The story is about a former big leaguer that is benched due to injuries. It goes into how baseball is his biggest passion. Even through all the upheavels of his life while he was growing up. He always kept the dream alive. After the big league, he settles down to raise a family in a small town in Texas. He is science teacher and baseball coach at the local high school. 
Somehow (I won't say how) the team discovers his past and challenges him to give it another try. He takes the challenge and makes it to the big time.
Enough of that...  It's also a story of a boy growing into a man, a man trying to make amends to his grown son about the failure of being there for him. A wife and family being there to help make the tough decisions. A town that believes in the dream. Friendship. Love. Sportsmanship. Team.
A really good film. No violence. No obscene words. No explicit scenes. Just a good film with a good story.
