This was if not the greatest, one of the greatest WrestleMania's of all time. Sure, Brock-Goldberg sucked, but Austin stunnin' both of them was awesome. The Triple-Threat Main Event was, (in my view), the GREATEST main event of all time. This match by itself made up for all the semi-crappy matches. The U.S. title opener was great. Yes, Big Show DOES suck. The two tag title matches were pretty good, but it would have been nice if one of the two would have changed hands. Rikishi and S2H??? Give me a break... That one hurt. Rock and Sock vs. Evolution was a good match, but it had the wrong result. I expected more out of the Great One. The evening gown MATCH itself wasnt all that great, but the four women involved in the match, parading around in lingerie was attention-keeping for the five minutes they were in the ring. Taker/Kane was nothing compared to their WM14 battle. It was nice to see a tombstone again though... The women's championship was actually a pretty good match, and watchin Molly get her head shaved was worth it. Y2J vs. Christian was an great match, and their Backlash match will be even better. And who could have predicted THAT ending...WOW...Trish as a heel will be interesting. The Cruiserweight match had a lot of crazy little high-flying S.O.B.'s. This match should have been longer... Rey got Robbed!!! Still a good match though. Eddie Guerrero/Kurt Angle was possibly the greatest NON-mainevnt/final match ever. I was rooting for Kurt, but i had to stand up and applaud the effort of both guys. What a Match!!!!! Sure, this event lacked in some areas, but there were some of the greatest matches in the history of the business in this event...
Thank You Vince!!!!!!!
