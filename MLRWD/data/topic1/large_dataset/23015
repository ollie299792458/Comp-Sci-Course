This movie isn't as bad as a lot of reviewers make it out to be. In a sea of unrelenting bad box office movies, this film at least keeps it's head above water. For Jennifer Lopez fans, there is enough sweetness factor to keep them happy. The plot is familiar and formulamatic, yet light and often funny. Charlie (Lopez) has lead a life of many part time jobs and is getting along just fine till she has a chance meeting with Dr. Kevin Fields (played a bit woodenly by Alias' Michael Vartan)and falls in love. Things couldn't be better until Kevin arranges for Charlie to meet his mother, Viola Fields (Fonda)a talk show host put out to pasture by her network and recently released after a break down from a hospital who has nothing left in life but making her son's prespective dates miserable. Kevin chooses to ask Charlie to marry him in front tof his mother and the hijinks begin. Viola has other plans and is hell bent to break them up. But as misery loves company, Charlie decides to fight back. Throw in Wanda Sykes as Viola's personal assistant who wants no part in this struggle and this makes for some very comical moments. Sykes is great in her small role but really chews on the scenery and makes the most of a role written far to small for this large comedic talent. The movie is largely entertaining but you may want to rent it before actually making the purchase. Worth a viewing at least.
