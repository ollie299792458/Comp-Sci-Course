Whenever I've seen THE RAT PATROL lately it was either (a) from a video I bought on Ebay or (b) on late night TV. In both cases the picture was washed out, faded or just plain jumpy. These new dvds are spectacular!  I've never seen the show in such vivid color and pristine sound!  Not that it matters, but every episode was originally in color- not just the later ones. If you watched it in color it's because your tv was black and white. Yes, kids. There was a time...

The show itself paraded out every cliched, 60s plot complication (temporary blindness, amnesia) but it still managed to be wildly entertaining.  With the pilot cowritten by Jon Gries and Lorenzo Semple Jr. how can we expect any less?

If you are expecting SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or BAND OF BROTHERS you'll be disappointed. If you like action and cool characters THE RAT PATROL is for you.  For the ladies there's 5 hot young guys including the German actor Hans Gudagest.  As has been revealed in several other reviews, he grew up to be Eric Braeden and went on to be King of the Soaps!
