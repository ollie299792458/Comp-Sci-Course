This is an excellent movie with an excellent cast. However I have noticed an unfortunate lack of rave reviews for Mr. Rooney's character. Most of these other 200-odd reviewers only mention him in passing with words such as unfortunate, overacted, racist, etc. etc. or are too scared to mention him at all.

  I am sick & tired of people who are super-sensitive to every little thing anyone says or does. When I see a comedian who makes fun of MY race, creed or color, I do one of two things.
If the joke is funny: I laugh
If the joke is not funny: I think to myself "this guy should be pumping my gas"

  The easiest thing to do in our society today is throw out the race card. The ones keeping racism alive & well in this country are the people who call others racists unjustly.

  It is funny to me how people criticize this era (50's-60's) as being uptight, when very few people today can take a joke concerning this subject. People are different & when someone points this out in a humorous way it is simply......A JOKE. It is not racism or mean-spirited, that is simply the way it is construed 40-some years after the fact, when we all live in an ultra-sensitive world, where everyone is scared #&*@less of offending anyone else.

  When people stop this super-sensitivity, & childish behavior, (crying like little babies at the slightest opportunity) we will all be better for it. We are all adults here, time to grow up.
