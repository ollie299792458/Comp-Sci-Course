At 30 years old, this remains the modern crime thriller standard.  It's the film that today's filmmakers have wanted to match and have either lacked the guts or imagination to do so.  (Though "The Limey" and "Mona Lisa" are great in their own right.  Frankly, when Steven Soderbergh made the "Limey", I think he was paying homage to "Get Carter".)  
I had vague memories of seeing this on cable in the early eighties.  Being a fan of Caine, I ordered it recently.  When my brother and I sat down to watch it, we simply were rocked by its rawness.  We who had sat through any number of Eastwood, Die Hard and Lethal Weapon.  Get Carter's bleak violence and sex makes most contemporary thrillers seem like adolescent pretenders.  The last third of the film, when he goes on a rampage, is simply not the sort of thing you're going to see in any thriller.  It's brutal.  
But it's real.  And it works.  You believe that beneath Carter's brutality there is a gangster's nobility, a willingness to throw away his fairly comfortable gangster's lifestyle for the sake of avenging an injustice.  I found the end crudely satisfying.  
Caine is a tremendous actor.  He can be warm and sympathetic ("Hannah and her Sisters"); he can be funny and clumsy ("Gambit") and, in "Get Carter", he can be a ruthless, frightening gangster.  No eyebrow raised to the audience to suggest that he's really a lovable sort.  No compromises at all.  A lesser actor would have done something to soften the edges of Carter.  Caine didn't.  It's an honest, courageous performance.
