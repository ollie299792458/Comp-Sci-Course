I'm always on the lookout for obscure low budget horror movies because at they're best they're way better than crappy PG-13 Hollywood horror movies and at their worst they're at least fun to make fun of.

"Laid To Rest" falls somewhere in between.

At its best, the gore is exclusively practical (live action effects) and is the main reason to see the movie. No stupid distracting CGI blood effects here, just good ol' school gore.

At its worst, the acting and dialog is pretty terrible and the camera work is nothing my 10-year-old niece couldn't do. There's also more than a few cliched scare tricks (when a girl in a horror movie steps in front of a bathroom mirror, you just KNOW something will suddenly appear behind her).

But wait! I haven't even gotten to the plot yet! Well, that's because there isn't one. A girl wakes up in a coffin with amnesia and the killer (aptly named "Chrome Skull") stalks her. Why? Doesn't matter. To what end? To kill her, I guess, but Chrome Skull gets the chance to do so more than once and doesn't. People don't see movies like this for the plot anyway, so nevermind that entirely.

Bottom line, it's a bad horror movie but it's also pretty fun to laugh at or make fun of if that's something you like to do (and I do), but it does have some pretty sweet gore effects and cameos from Terminator TV show actors Lena Headey and Thomas Dekker. Watch it with the one you love.
