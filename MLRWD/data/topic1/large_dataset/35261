Bela Lugosi gives a stellar performance as the zombie master in White Zombie. This is one of Lugosi's strongest performances and one of his strongest films. White Zombie is consistently entertaining from beginning to end. And that entertainment rises and falls on Lugosi's wonderful ability to breathe life into even the "deadest" of roles. 
The movie begins with an engaging yet eerie "Haitian" funeral song and it is revealed that a burial ceremony is taking place in the middle of the road because so many bodies have been stolen -- no sooner do we learn this than Bela appears with a entourage of zombies. He steals a scarf from the film's ingenue. It seems he has been contracted by a wealthy plantation owner to secure the love of this fair maiden for him. Of course it isn't
long before Bela turns on the wealthy scoundrel and makes him a zombie too.
Of course true love wins in the end and Lugosi is pushed off a cliff by the new zombified planataion owner and the young woman and her handsome beau are free to go get married. . .
But through it all Bela Lugosi makes you believe he is truly capable of controlling the wills of others with his magnificent eyes and powerful imminence. This is the movie that Bela and Ed are watching in the movie Ed Wood -- and he uses the famous interlocking hand gesture that he would later repeat in Bride of the Monster.
White Zombie is my favorite zombie movie -- I realize it doesn't provide he visceral thrills and claustraphobic intensity that Night of the Living ead does -- but it is a more subtle kind of film that focusses on the zombie master rather than his minnions. The film's director knew Bela's strengths as a silent actor and utilizes him to the fullest.
I highly recommend White Zomie to the Bela Lugosi and horror movie fan. It is practically a textbook example of the genre.
