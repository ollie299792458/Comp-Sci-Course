Before I married my wife, I was not a big Audrey Hepburn fan at all.  I had not seen any of her movies, and had only heard her name come up when Jennifer Love Hewitt did the TV movie about her several years ago.  HOWEVER, my life changed (in more ways than one) when I married one of the biggest Audrey Hepburn fans of all time!! Before I knew it, I was singing along with "Just You Wait, Henry Higgins" with "My Fair Lady" and "Blue River" with "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and going crazy every single time I saw good AH movie that was not in my collection.  When my wife told me about "Wait Until Dark", the fact that Audrey plays a blind woman sparked my curiosity and I bought it almost right away.  BUT NOTHING COULD HAVE PREPARED ME FOR THIS MASTERPIECE!!!  The movie is AMAZING, and I wish I was alive back when it was first released in theaters because that would have definitely been a wild experience.  Scary movies these days are too unrealistic; directors seem to feel as if you have to have a lot of special effects, screaming, and bloody scenes to be effective.  However, "Wait Until Dark" proves that sometimes it's not what you see that is scary, but rather what you do not.  CLASSIC, CLASSIC, CLASSIC!!
