I could not have imagined being glued to my television for such a long time, but I can't take my eyes off I, Claudius.  Derek Jacobi is absolutely amazing, but the greatest honors go to Sian Phillips, whose Livia deserved  every acting honor possible.  Yes, Livia, you are a goddess!  I am  enthralled by Patrick Stewart as Sejanus, &amp; he was better looking with  hair!  I felt a certain amount of pity for George Baker's Tiberius, who  seemed a rather decent sort before his mother got through with him.  It was  nice to see John Castle (Geoffrey, my favorite brother, in Lion in Winter)  as Postumus, and his resemblance to Simon McCorkindale, who played one of  his brothers (the first to die, I forget his name) is remarkable.  Brian  Blessed is also outstanding, as is Margaret Tyzack (so good in The Forsyte  Saga).  I must say, though, that for me Jay Robinson (The Robe, Demetrius  &amp; the Gladiators) is the ultimate Caligula.  I first became interested  in this when I read that the character of Vir Cotto in Babylon 5 was based  on Claudius.  How true, even down to the prophecy (a sybil has prophecied  that Claudius will become emperor, and a Centauran prophetess saw the same  destiny for Vir).  I absolutely loved it!
