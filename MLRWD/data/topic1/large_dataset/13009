It was a rare saturday (last night) when I got to stay at home just to watch HBO and as luck would have it, at 4 in the morning this movie, which seems to be set in the old times somewhere in Europe, starts and catches my attention. I had not heard of 'Les Miserables' ever, but now after seeing what I saw I can't wait to get my hands on the book and also experience the musical.
I found the movie a beautiful peice of art. Set in the old times in France, the movie tries to show the hardships faced by this man, once a convict followed by being a generous mayor then a caring lover of a woman, who spits on his face (I got to say Uma Thuran looks absolutely fabulous in the movie), a caring father-like, and then the saviour of an infamy (among the cops) revolutionary for his daughter. 
There were two parts in the movie which which particularly left an impression &amp; which I shall never forget:
1) when he lifts Uma in his arms and brings her to the table for having a meal with her;
2) after the inspector tells him, he's free and kills himself, you could see the expression on his face that for the first time in his life he feels free and doesn't having anything to fear...
 I wish I could read the book forst, so i could judge the adaptation more critically.. but currently, i am high on the performances and the imagerry.
Real Nice!!!
