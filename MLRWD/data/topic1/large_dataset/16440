Great movie, easily in the category of the cast-of-thousands greats from thirty or forty years ago.  Was William Wallace really a bigger hero than Robert the Bruce?  Beats me, I wasn't there and neither were any of Wallace's (or Mel's) current gaggle of detractors.  One thing is clear, the Bruce's historians were more practiced, better connected and doubtless, higher-born.  All of which makes it all the more remarkable that we know anything about William Wallace at all.
Mel Gibson's acting is superb.  And the scenery is breathtaking.  Sure there are some flights of fancy here and there, in part because Wallace's legend was passed down by itinerate entertainers for many years, rather than being diligently recorded by court chroniclers like the highborn or royalty - who of course had their own story to tell.  Oh, well...  Brave Heart probably fits closer to the historical novel category, than a pure old documentary.  Documentaries often seem compelled to leave out much of what cannot be proven, unless it serves some contemporary expediency.  Thankfully Brave Heart doesn't fall prey to this pedagogical frailty and is entertaining from start to finish - I suspect that's what Mr. Gibson had in mind all along.  And he told a wonderful story in the process.
Yes, I wish it ended differently; Yes, I was angry at the betrayal, Yes I rejoiced in the victories; Yes it's probably a little too graphic for the tie-dyed crowd and yes, I've watched it several times.  Great, great flick, well deserving of all its accolades.
