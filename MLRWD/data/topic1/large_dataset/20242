Regardless of what really happened between Queen Elizabeth, her family, and Tony Blair during the days after Diana's death, this is a great, well-told story.

Queen Elizabeth and Tony Blair meet as potential adversaries after his election to the post of Prime Minister.  He has ideas of change and reform; she intends to staunchly maintain tradition and protocol in the face of a changing world.  The public's reaction to Diana's death leads each one to challenge the other in often uncomfortable ways, yet through this challenge, each learns to bend without breaking.  They come to a place where they can indeed work together for the good of the country.  The director, Stephen Frears, makes us feel that we are witnessing the real behind-closed-doors conversations whose results play out in both the public and private arenas.  The changes wrought in the two main characters (the Queen and Blair) are subtle, and never presented in a heavy-handed way.

We, of course, can never know what was really said and done in the days following Diana's death.  We don't know if Charles was really as sympathetic as he appears in this film.  We don't know if Prince Phillip and the Queen Mum were really as callous and hard-hearted as they are presented here.  We do not know what exact words were exchanged between the Queen and Blair.  But the story that is told is intricate and compelling, and if it isn't an accurate depiction of the historical event...it should be!
