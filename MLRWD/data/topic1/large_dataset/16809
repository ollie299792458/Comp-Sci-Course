I was 100% pleased with Antitrust.I ran across it late one night on cable or something like that,and well that was enough for me to watch it a record 31 times now.I know EVERY line,seem boring to you?well every time i watch it,i seem to see more n more,only problem is i am dying to find out who the darn artist is when Milo and his "Girlfriend" i wont spoil that one,i AM tempted though cos I saw her in the artist movie "Basquit" -think my spellings off but i dont real much care for her and her performances BUT she did on ok job here with her pouting and crap.Ryan rocked he did a great job it was nice to see him play the "good GUY" for a change also cos all i remember him from is the "summer i told you"-pun big time flick...but i am in love with this movie hate his wife(in real life YUCK MAN!) oh and love him plus Tim Robbins was excellent...a great movie that its actually wantes me to go into the computer science field instead of the graphic one-i AM an artist-although he does like to brag.LOL.my ??? finally is WHO is the artist at Garys house when milo and alice go to Garys "Fundraiser" party.The one who keeps apearing on the screens(dont bill gates have something like that???)if anyone can help Id appreciate since i do tattoo flash comic work and my fav. artist not if it matters is DALI..so i would LOVE to know who did that work that keeps flashing when Milo is getting those IP address's from garys house -party - fundraiser-whatever..oh and i am glad they DIDNT put leigh cook to sleep with him great editing,although watching it enogh you can see where they shopuldve put maybe another little thing to fill it up.one minute-nightime they talking then its morning and there getting gasolie-hmmmm??
BUT besides those teeny blunders -GET THIS MOVIE its way way interesting and ryan i agree puts in his all..
i also havent seen cruel intentions-heard its good though but i could get jealous..kidding....and i havent heard  NO-ONES mentioned Gosard Park-i own that but never watched the whole thing he was great in what i saw of it....if my spelling is again off i apologize ..
anyone e mail me whenever i am lonely cant you tell...
lots n lots xo stephanie..
enjoy emeninselly...i didnt do ggod in spelling ...xoxooxoxoxox
