This is one of those movies that surprised both me and my wife in a very pleasant way.  
Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel are father and son seperated by the father's death some 30 years earlier.  Through a freak solar and atmospheric occurence, they are able to communicate through time via the father's short-wave radio.  
Seeing the father with his son, as a 6-year old, in 1969 and their interaction 30 years later, is wonderful to watch.  What starts as a touching reunion turns into a taut thriller as the son realizes that his interaction with his father has caused tragic and unexpected results.
The question that comes to mind is this.  If you could save a loved one, would you do it if the result meant things about your life (or other people's) might change, for better or worse?  
Dennis Quaid plays the working class, NY fireman as both loving and a bit hard-nosed.  James Caviezel is great to watch as the son who has grown into a man who is not what he or his father envisioned, but who has a chance to redeem himself.  If you have children, many of the situations will tug at your heart, but this movie is not pandering to your base emotions.  It shows the paths that each life takes based on decisions and fate and makes you think about what is in store for each of us.  
Some plot issues are glossed over a bit, but they do not interfere with the enjoyment of the film.  The setting in the middle-class New York neighborhood gives a nice feel to the film and it is nice to see a movie that can show gritty realism and heart-warming interaction in the same two hours.
The video transfer of this DVD is very good and the audio will have you looking over your shoulder if you have a surround sound system.  There are quite a few extras to sift through as well.  
Load this disc, sit back in a comfy chair and be entertained.
