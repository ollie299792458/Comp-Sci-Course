As we come into Advent and look toward Christmas, consider picking up this book, published earlier this year.  You'll get a flavor for the book at [...], but the book goes deeper in all the subjects discussed there.

What would it mean to make Advent a time of preparation for the birth of our savior?  It always sounds like a good idea, but by Christmas Eve most of us will be frazzled and anxious, worn out by the tired rituals and endless scurry of preparing for this holiday.  Advent Conspiracy offers practical suggestions for changing those patterns, with four specific, memorable steps:  1.  Worship fully; 2.  Spend less; 3.  Give more; and 4. Love all.  The idea of giving PRESENCE rather than PRESENTS at Christmas is significant, especially when you consider that the gift of Jesus to humanity is itself a gift of God's PRESENCE ("God with us").

This is not a heavy, scholarly book.  It's much more a book intended to shake you out of routines that you've hardly thought to question.  It's a book that could change your Christmas, and your life.
