I've been studying movies for over a decade now and believe me when I say this that Tarantino is possibly one of the best or possibly the best director I have ever scene. He can take a mediocre plot and film it so beautifully that you get hooked onto the movie so badly you can't let go. "Reservoir Dogs" makes you feel like you actually know each of these criminals one by one.
Now not seeing the movie may make you think I'm a little disturbed when I say this but the graphic violence and the ultra graphic language is part of why this movie is so great. It brings you into the atmosphere, I mean criminals actually act and talk like that. The acting of the convicts are so superb, Keitel and Busecmi (Did I spell that right?)
Now this clever plot about a few guys pulling a heist and having an undercover cop in the works is pieced together and filmed very differently than other movies I've seen. It's quite interesting.
I have been recommended to watch "Pulp Fiction" I hear its better, but who knows. Watch this movie for Tarantinos greatness in filming, he is a tad weird though I mean look at the ear scene, probably the most memorable "infamous" scene of the movie. This DVD has three alternate angles, I dont dare watch them (yuck!)
