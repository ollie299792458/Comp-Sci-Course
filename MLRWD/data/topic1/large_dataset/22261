Doubtless millions of dollars were flushed down the you know what to bring this movielike product to market. There is not an identifyingly plausible real character, relationship or scenario in the entire movie. I am as capable of accepting a suspension of strict realism for the sake of a good story or deeper underlying premise as anyone, but that does not apply here. As with most contemporary movies, the concept of the screenplay as a living organism that should have some kind of coherence in all its myriad parts is apparently a foreign concept. Whatever psychological condition the Matthew Perry character has which causes him to experience life in some markedly different way from anybody else--i.e. the key to the entire movie--is not conveyed at all. Nothing tangentially related to him--how he earns enough money that it is seemingly no object to him, why various women characters find him sexually desirable--make any sense within the context of the movie. Lynn Collins is cute and is the kind of girl one might dream of encountering at the pool table in the neighborhood dive bar in Rochester, but she certainly has no future as a movie star. The Mary Steenbergen character is completely ridiculous, and all of the minor characters are wholly flat, and the scenes involving them clunky and lifeless, the dialogue banal. It's atrocious, and I'm only bothering to post a review because I need practice at identifying with some clarity to myself why things are inferior, and also to try to bring the overall rating of the film down.
