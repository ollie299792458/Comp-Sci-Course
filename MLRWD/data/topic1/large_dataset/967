I don't write many reviews but on occassion a product or show comes around that I think deserves mention. There would never be any shortage of comments for a mainstream show like "Friends" or a movie like "Titanic" but sometimes a good show flies by almost under the radar that deserves some mention. Boomtown is one such show. Working at an NBC affiliate, this show was one of less than a handfull of shows that I actually looked forward to putting on the air. I never expected to see it released and for a bargain price of around $17 you can't go wrong.

I guarantee you've never seen a show like it. The "seen from every side" storytelling approach was a fresh and very effective concept. This show is certainly not your normal cop show. The characters were human- with flaws and weaknesses - not superhuman bullet spraying heros like a lot of shows. Though the episode where Fearless has the gunfight at the motel is a little too exaggerated, the rest of the show is pretty darn good and some of it is truly excellent. It sucks the viewer into it and you can sort of feel what is going on. Like someone else posted, it's not vegetable viewing as you need to be alert so as to figure out what is going on.

I recommend this show. NBC dropped the ball again by cancelling this one.
