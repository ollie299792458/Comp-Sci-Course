I'm a BIG fan of Robert Parker's earlier "Spenser" novels, so thought I would take a look at his "Jesse Stone" series.  The book on which this film is based is, in my opinion, only fair.  But Selleck made it into a very good, small/initimate detective/police procedural thriller.

(Ironically, in an interview included in the "Special Features" on the DVD, Selleck apologies to Parker fans for certain plot changes made in the movie.  In my opinion, these changes greatly improved the plot - and I say that as a Parker fan.)

Selleck seems to bring more and more authenticity and . . . well . . .gravitas . . . to each new role he tackles.  You see this in his Westerns, e.g., Quigley Down Under (which I also recommend).  Part of it is acting.

But if you know what to look for you can tell that Selleck knows his way around firearms and is not some Hollywood nitwit who would like as not shoot his foot off in Real Life.  I think this actual knowledge bleeds over into Selleck's film roles, and helps make him believable.

Bottom Line: "Stone Cold" is better than 95% of the bigger budget, "fantasy" cop films that are out there.  No explosions or car chases. Just a good story; good acting; and characters you care about.
