Hugo is a 3D film masterpiece adapted from the historical-fiction novel titled 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' written and illustrated by Brian Selznick and published by Scholastic Press.

Set in 1931 Paris (France), it is an international movie with a wonderfully gifted team behind it. The actors were all first-rate, as was character and plot development. The cinematography was breath-taking. Filmed in true 3D (not 2D and then adapted for 3D), the sense of being there was excellent.

This was a pleasant and enchanting adventure tale with a tribute to the early days of cinema and one of its neglected pioneers.

Rated PG for mild thematic material, some action peril, and a character that smoked cigars, the PG rating provides a note of caution about some scenes of suspense and emotional intensity that may be tough for the very young or sensitive children (though this film would have been rated G back in the early 1970s) and is unlike any of Scorsese's other films.

I truly enjoyed it and, for me, this was the best film of 2011.
