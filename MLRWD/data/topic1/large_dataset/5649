Another martial arts actor attempts to imitate Bruce Lee on one of his films (Fist of Fury, realeased in USA as Chinese Connection), but again fall short.  It's amazing to me that the movie Bruce Lee made back in the 70s is still better than the modern made imitation of his film.  I would say the best imitation of Bruce Lee's movie was made by Jet Li in "Fist of Legend", but even that fall short compared to the original Bruce Lee film.

Bruce Lee will always be imitated but never duplicated.  He was the first martial artist with an open mind that combined all effective techniques from different martial arts from all around the world, not only the Chinese style, but Korean, Japanese, and even American (boxing).  He trained with the best to become the best fighter that became a legend.

Far as reviewing this film, they seem really hard to imitate Bruce Lee in every way possible with "Kato" mask look and even Bruce Lee's famous fighting sounds.  It just doesn't seem natural or original.  At least Jet Li portrayed/expressed his character in his own way so it looked more genuine than Donny in this film.  I'm surprised by the high rating of this film, but I guess if you never saw the original or Jet Li's version, this version is not bad.
