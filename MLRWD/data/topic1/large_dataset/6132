First off, I'll be honest. If this flick didn't have Harrison Ford I never would've seen it. Josh Hartnett is an actor I am not familiar with at all. The fact that this movie was being described as a "cop-buddy" picture had me cringing.
I first saw "Hollywood Homicide" in the theatre (the cheap-theatre mind you), and I didn't really like it at all. I thought it started off well, had some clever writing, and developed the characters nicely. Towards the second half of the film however, I thought things just got more and more ridiculous (the car chases, television news helicopters following in pursuit, and an all too familiar fight on top of a tall building between Harrison and one of the bad dudes.)
When this movie was released on DVD...I had no intention of buying it, not even to keep my "Harrison Ford Collection" current. After awhile, however, I decided to bring it home and give it a second chance.
I was really surprised...but I ended up liking this movie a whole lot better the second time around! The first half of the film with all the character development and the setting up of the plot is still what works best, but the rest of the movie kinda grew on me. You really need to have a "suspension of disbelief" to swallow some of the things that go on. 
Things I didn't really pick up on the first time around included some elements of the plot, cameos by some famous people, and I also came to appreciate that Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett have some really, really good chemistry together.
The DVD is sorely missing in Extras and Bonus Features, but that's o.k., the movie is what matters.
Hollywood Homicide is not a fantastic "10 out of 10" movie, but it's got some great qualities making it worth seeing...I'm glad I gave it a second chance.
