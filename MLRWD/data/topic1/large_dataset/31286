Got hold of this Box Set on Blu Ray a couple of days ago, first one I played was The Motion Picture, I was prepared for disappointment because it always looks terrible and my previous directors cut dvd was dreadful. However I was impressed with the quality, with the exception of some of the special effects scenes which use third and fourth generation film prints, quality was on a par with the recent Blu Ray james bond releases of Dr No and from Russia with love.

Next up was Wrath of Khan, this is my favourite star trek film as it has the best story, it states on the packaging that this particular movie has undergone extensive restoration so I was expecting even better than the first movie but I was disappointed, the image is by far the worst of the box set, its even worse in a lot of scenes than my unconverted dvd version, I don't know what they've done to this movie but the quality is bad with grain all over the place.

Star trek 3 is on a par with the first movie in terms of quality, so there was no disappointment there, Star Trek 4 is similar but many of the scenes are filmed using various forms of camera filters and the like, so you don't really get to see many clear scenes but this is only down to the quality of the filming techniques used and not the transfer.

Next up Star trek 5 and 6, 5 has some great moments of clarity and again its a good transfer which only dulls in its high def clarity when filters and lighting techniques dull the image, Star Trek 6 is on a similar level to 3 with a good transfer but the story lags a bit and tends to take itself too seriously. The captains Summit is an easy way to pass an hour, you don't really learn anything new except that William shatner has never managed to sit through a complete episode of next generation, that makes two of us.

Overall a decent release, and when you compare it with the likes of Fox's box set of the original planet of the apes movies, or Warners Dirty Harry re-issues on blu ray, you see how good it really is. The only real disappointment is Wrath of khan, ime wondering if they've accidentally lost the negative to this movie or something as the transfer just isn't high def quality, and ime hoping this movie will be remastered again at some point from better source materials.
