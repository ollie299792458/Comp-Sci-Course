When I head that "The Tale of Despereaux" was going to be turned into a movie, having read the book I couldn't help but feel a little uneasy about this move. This isn't for the usual reason of worrying about the movie not staying true to the book, but the fact that I thought it would stay in fact to true to the book.

See, if you have not read the book, you'll find that the story is told in a non-linear way, far from the best. My worry was, if the movie followed this story telling format, it would be a major bombshell. Eventually though, I did get around to watching the movie and found myself pleasantly surprised. I found the movie to be a good adaptation and better then the book.

The movie was told in a linear manner. The characters were given more depth to their characters then what the book put out. The things that grated on my nerves in the book were gone. The changes that needed to be made to make the movie successful worked. And I might add, the rat character is treated as a more gray area character then the books decided to treat him.

No... "The Tale of Despereaux" is not the most amazing film out there, I must admit. But considering the original source material, I personally think they did well. I've heard others who've read the books who disagree on this part, but that may also be due to the fact that I've read other book series similar to this like Redwall, so I know it isn't the best.
