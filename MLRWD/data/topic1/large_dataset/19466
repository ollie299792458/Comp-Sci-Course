I personally like this movie.  Very good, humorous movie for teenagers.  I watched it with my family and my parents and sister hated it.  They humor is only appreciated by certain people.  I would relate this movie to certain humor in old school and Dude, Where's my car.  The movie really has no point, but if you are looking for a good movie to sit down to and get a good laugh, I recommend you take a good look at this movie.

And for people who like a little bit of information on the plot, here you go:

The movie starts off when Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller have competing gymnasiums built right across the street from eachother.  Vince doesnt pay his mortgage so the bank threatens to shut his gym down if he doesnt come up with $50,000 in a month.  He almost gives up getting the money until one of the loyal gym patrons finds a magazine add advertising the American Dodgeball Association of America dodgeball tournament.  (Yes, it is the adaa, not a typo.)  The winning prize is $50,000.  I am going to skip the rest because if you like what you have read you will like the movie.  The ending is quite unexpected as well, and is very good.

Overall rating of the movie: 4 stars out of 5
