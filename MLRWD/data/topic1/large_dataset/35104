I have many of the Bogart movies, this just recently having been given to me as a Fathers Day gift. This is one that I enjoy watching over and over again about once a year.  The story line is excellent and to think they made these movies at the rate of one a week. Bogart was a real life character. He had an appeal that almost can't be explained.  He had that rugged look, but his on screen personality is what made him.  I also found it interesting that John Houston plays the cameo part in the movie.  Walter Houston and Tim Holt also had outstanding performances and actually outdid Bogart in this movie. This movie will always be remembered for the classic line by the Mexican bandit, "We don't need no stinkin badges."  If you had a nickel for everytime that  line has been repeated you would be reach.  The movie also tells the story of human greed and how fate can deal you a swift kick in the butt, but also how in the end Tim Holt and Walter Houston can realize that there is more to life the being wealthy. I place this as one of my favorite movies along with Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon. But let's not forget the other great actors of this era, Erol Flynn and Tyrone Power.  I have grown up with these "old" movies, but will always love them with the stories they impart about people and our lives and the fragile nature of life.  PS And don't forget how great the music is that accompanies the picture....just greatness all around.
