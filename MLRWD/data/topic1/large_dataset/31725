I was absolutely blown away when I saw this film! Fox has emulated Disney, not altering the formula but noticably increasing on the quality of the end result.
The storytelling is magnificent. Naturally it is not historically accurate, but that comes as no surprise. The adaptation is liberal, and creates a very different story than the historical account. By removing a lot of the grimness of the revolution, the filmmakers could create a sparkling and grandiose mood to place their story into.
The songs and score are of a caliber Disney has not matched to date, although I confess that the Alan Menken / Howard Ashman team of The Little Mermaid and Beauty &amp; the Beast comes very close. The music was written in the tradition of the Broadway musical, as Menken and Ashman did, and sounds exceptional.
I was especially impressed with the animation. There are no scenes where a particular character is draw badly, so scenes where the characters do not maintain their proportion to other characters, and no continuity errors. The drawing style is very similar to the older Disney - Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and that crowd.
The characters are believable and entertaining; there are no "awkward moments" where a line seems badly written or placed, the songs are integrated perfectly into the dialogue, the layout work is exquisite, and the use of 3D technology is stunning and smoothly integrated. And Fox picked all the right people for the roles.
Overall, this is an incredible film, even more astonishing considering it was Fox's first attempt at an animated film. And it's not just a children's film, as animation is too often considered; it is a family film: anyone can see and enjoy it. Smashing!
