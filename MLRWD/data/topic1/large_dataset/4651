This is a review for KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL, a 1952 MGM release directed by Phil
Karlson and starring John Payne, Colleen Gray and Preston Foster. KANSAS CITY
CONFIDENTIAL is now a MGM DVD release.

Joe Rolfe, played by John Payne, is an ex-con and is and driving a floral delivery truck making regularly scheduled deliveries every day.  One nine am delivery is to a shop next to a bank which has an armoured truck to pick up cash up every day about the same time.  One morning all hell breaks loose when some masked hold up men shoot the armoured car guards and use a similar floral delivery truck to haul the cash away about one minute after the actual floral delivery truck has pulled away.

The police catch up with Joe Rolfe and his truck and arrest and then question him for quite some time.  He denies everything and eventually is let go because there really is no evidence
against him.  Joe Rolfe is determined to discover the identity of the crooks and clear his name as well as return the money.  One clue leads to another as the trail (and story) gets a little more dark and twisted with each discovery. Eventually Joe Rolfe finds himself in Mexico, in a resort town, looking for and finding the crooks and having a hand in their
eventual fate.

I think Kansas City Confidential is a fine film, it seems more like an independent effort than a studio product. It is well directed and acted, a top grade noir all around.
I say it's a noir because of the almost hopeless situation Joe Rolfe, an everyman with a past, finds himself in.  That is not to mention the crooks and their eventual dire situation,
without giving too much away.

If you have the chance to see Kansas City Confidential I would recommend it.
Four and One Half Stars.
