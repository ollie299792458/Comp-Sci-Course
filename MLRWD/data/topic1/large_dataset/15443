I read the book before seeing the movie. There are differences, of course, not any worse than other movie adaptations from books.  In fact, the ending of the book really left the reader hanging. The movie helped clear up some the "mystery", but not a lot. Ron Howard did an exceptional job of directing the film. On the negative side, I thought Tom Hanks seemed somehow out of character. Tom Hanks superior acting abilities are well known from previous films. I can not put my finger on how I found Hanks to be different in this film than other films he has been in.  However, Ron Howard may have been trying to follow the book as much as possible. In the book, Dr. Langdon was caught up in a web of suspense leaving him clueless as to what and why events were happening around him. (By the way, I felt clueless after reading the book and seeing the film!) At any rate, I loved the spine-chilling suspense of the movie and that is why I rate it at four points. As far as the premise of the book, I think this very old tale was made up by the French and became urban legend throughout the centuries. Christ did not need to marry or father a child. He was born of a virgin, why would he marry? The premise is nonsense! One blink of his eye and millions of women could have been made pregnant. (The bible is full of miraclous healings of others plus the example of granting Sarah a child in her old age; she was probably in her 90's when she bore Isaac.) The French aristocracy just wanted to tout themselves as having some sort of lineage through Christ. What a hoot!
