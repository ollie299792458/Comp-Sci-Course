I have been a fan of the movie for years.  I have seen good movies made unwatchable by bad transfers but this is not the case.  It has been Digitaly augmented by Scott himself who owned an original print of the film.  It is shown in Letterbox and this inproves the picture quality as many a film critic will undestand.

  It has a nice Picture Gallery track in the Features section as well as the original Theatrical trailer.  But for me the best of the special features is an Audio Track by Tony Scott and Susan Sarandon.  I expected both Scott and Sarandon adress the sexuality of the piece and the kind of behind the scene information on location shoots and other such gems that allow you to visit the real thought processes that went into this film.

Scott is not a smooth talker by any means but he is slightly less condesending then his Brother and Susan Sarandon shows her sence of humor and knowlege of the art of the craft of acting all during her commentary.

  I have been waiting for this DVD for some time and I had a sneaking feeling that It might be dissapointing after so many years but the extras and the well transfered print make it so much more then I  could hope for.
