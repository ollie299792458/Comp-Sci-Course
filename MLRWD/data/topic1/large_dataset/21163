In this action thriller, based on the national best-seller by Tom Clancy, Sean Connery gives a riveting performance as a top Communist naval commander who steals one of Mother Russia's newest and deadliest nuclear  submarines, heading for the U.S.  But is he heading there to defect, or to  launch his missiles?  This film features a wonderfully complex leading  performance by Connery that is a breath of fresh air in a genre that all  too often mires itself in testosterone to the exclusion of everything else.  Alec Baldwin also shows surprising depth as Jack Ryan, the role made  famous in later Clancy-based films by Harrison Ford.  While most likely  appealing most to men, this film avoids many pitfalls that plague films of  this genre, including predictability and a formula plot.  Director John  McTiernan cleverly paces the plot and the suspense, and thankfully avoids  overwhelming the militarily-challenged in his audience with all the  techno-speak that pervades this story.  Wonderful supporting performances,  especially by Sam Neill as Connery's second-in-command, struggling to keep  the crew in line while wrestling at times with his own doubts about the  captain's sanity.  Great cinematography, script, and editing.  While it  might seem dated given the collapse of the Soviet Union, this thriller is  well worth buying, especially if you're a Connery fan looking for something  in his post-James Bond era.
