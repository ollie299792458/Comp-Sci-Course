I'm not a terrible person by giving this one star.  Too bad the story regarding poor young girls with heart defects that end up badly is only a story, and an immature one at best.  I thought the story was simply ridiculous.  I'm supposed to feel badly for poor, stupid Richard Gere, who cheats on this fine young thing because he didn't know what else to do.  I have no sympathy for this guy who finally finds true love (still he cheats) and is left broken hearted.  Also I find her very weak in taking him back, as if he's the catch of the world.  He didn't even have to true very hard in order to win her back either.  I don't feel bad for him because he is nearly 50 and shanking a 22 year old with a heart defect.  NO!  
I also found stupid the fact that they go on one date and are professing their love toward each other.  This movie appears to be geared to teenagers as well as written by one also.
Last fact---her hats her ridiculous also and once they met didn't he have to work again----ever.
