Low-Budget movies seem to be coming out nonstop this year and here yet again is another one, but is Gacy as bad as it seems? Sure this movie has its flaws, but what movie doesn't?
Well lets start off with the plot. The story is the public and secret life of John Wayne Gacy...but it doesn't really cover much of the background of Gacy's childhood. It starts off with Gacy as a teenanger on a camping/fishing trip with his father, but then immediately it goes to Gacy's life when he was married for the 2nd time. We only see a part of Gacy's life before he was caught and exposed for what he had done.
The effects were okay, maybe the directing and lighting wasn't good for some, but I really didn't mind it. I usually never notice these kind of things anyways, I mostly watch for the acting.
Speaking of which, wasn't that great. I mean besides Mark Holton as Gacy himself, the other actors were horrible. Mark Holton was intense and gave great dedication to the character. I think he pulled it off quite well, and I notice that his acting was one of the best highlights of the movie everyone seems to agree on. It was different to see him play such a character, especially when you see him in movies like Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Leprechaun.
Overall I liked 'Gacy' in a way. I wish the movie had covered more about his life, but what it did cover gave me more insight on the serial killer, John Wayne Gacy.
If you've seen this movie around, you should definately rent it first. I don't think it's for everyone, but if you have seen it and you enjoyed it, buy it for your collection.
