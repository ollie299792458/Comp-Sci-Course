I saw the play in person prior to the introduction of David Hasselhoff.  I listened to the soundtrack from the original Broadway cast until I ruined the CD.  I have read the book over and over again.  My sister bought me this video as a present because she knew how much I enjoyed JEKYLL AND HYDE, but by the time it was over, we were both dumbfounded.
David Hasselhoff is simply not big enough for the part.  Jekyll and Hyde are supposed to be two entirely different personalities with different voices, faces, and statures.  Hasselhoff does not distinguish the two characters, which degrades the entire point of the story.  Maybe it would have helped if he had read the book before the performance.  In the transformation scenes, he appears to be doing acrobatics rather than convulsions.
Many of the singers do not have the vocal capacity for the parts that they played.  Two characters lived up to their parts - Utterson and the red-bearded man in the chorus.  The historical discrepancies in costume and hair are abominable.
I highly recommend that you experience this play because it is a work of art and masterfully displays the musical genius of Frank Wildhorn and Leslie Bricusse, but find another way because this performance is a vast disappointment.
