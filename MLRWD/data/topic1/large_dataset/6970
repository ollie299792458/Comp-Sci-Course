The Usual Suspects is one of those movies I've heard legendary tales of for years but that I never got around to watching. The DVD I watched was the original disc (not the fancy new one), and since this movie came out ten years ago the audio and visual quality were pretty bad. But since this is an old-fashioned movie in the sense that it wants to entertain by telling a real story with interesting characters instead of putting all its hopes in flashy special effects, the bad quality of the technology didn't actually matter. The plot is rather confusing, involving the complex lives of five career criminals, strange underground crime deals, and an unseen, mysterious crime boss hovering over all the action. In one sense the film is a traditional whodunit, but as the viewer gets deeper into the story, you not only begin to wonder who did it but what it actually was that he did, since the main story is being told by one of the criminals, and you are never quite sure if he is telling the truth. The screenwriter obviously put a lot of thought into the story, as this is one of the smartest crime films I've ever seen, and it contains surprises for the viewer on a Shyamalanesque scale. It's a joy to watch filmmaking of this caliber, and now I know why the X-Men series has done so well in Singer's capable hands.
