This is one of the coolest, most suspenseful, most awesome films I've ever seen! It's about a cop named Jack(Keanu Reeves)who is facing a former cop, now a villain wanting his pay for his duty as a cop named Howard Payne(Dennis Hooper)He's going through a lot of games, traps and explosives, and of course shootings to try and save the innocent, stop Payne from terrorizing and/or killing people. Along the way, he meets up with a pretty cute little lady and they soon fall in love, or at least start to. In the end, Jack fights with Howard Payne atop a train(what a copy of SpiderMan and Doctor Octopus!)Payne is kicking his ass all over the place until Jack sees a red stoplight. Payne is capped after his head hits the light and snap goes his neck. Jack and his lady then survive the train crashing and their love life begins at the movie's end. It is an intense, cool and funny film that anyone over the age of 15 would adore. I love it and would suggest anyone who likes fighting movies to buy or rent it.
