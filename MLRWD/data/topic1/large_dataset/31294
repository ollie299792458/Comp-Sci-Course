I am not the biggest fan of the horror genre because of the lack brains (other than those that ooze) the genre displays... but that's where YBR takes off.  It's a very smart movie that is actively trying to mess with your head.  You feel like you are descending into the same madness that characters are.  Part 'out in the woods horror' and part David Lynch, YellowBrickRoad has some murder and gore, but it really gets you with its brains.

The ensemble cast is quite strong.  In general the quality of this production outpaces what seems to be a fairly low budget.  It doesn't try to pull of things that a low budget horror movie couldn't pull off.  It reminds me of classic horror in that what it shows you is messed up, but what it doesn't show you is what is most frightening.

Fantastic stuff.  I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this in the theater and preordered it on here as soon as I noticed it.  Any fans of smart horror or lynchian mindbenders would be smart to check this out.
