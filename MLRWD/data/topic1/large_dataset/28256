I haven't seen Let Me In in 3 and a half months since I saw it in theaters, so a lot of what I remember is vague but the movie still haunts me. I'm not going to attempt to go into detail since it's been so long, I probably wouldn't be able to do it justice anyway. There are many reviews here who explain it more than well enough.

I haven't see the original or read the book, but I was definitely blown away by this movie. It was beautiful, intriguing, and just as much disturbing. I was totally taken aback by this after I had to get up and leave the theater - I pretty much didn't know what to do with myself.

It is so raw and simple and touching, especially with the theme of good and evil, love, innocence, the basic and painful need for companionship, and the lengths someone will go to in order to support the person they care most about.

My husband is what I have come to call "emotionally retarded (although he has gotten better over the years)," and I am ready for him to see this movie. I am really excited to be able to own it on DVD. In fact, I don't believe I have ever really been this ready to own a movie before.

My only qualm is when the vampire action comes around it ended up being too "animated," and ended up being cheesy and hokey to me. That really kind of offput me but I still give this movie 5 stars.
