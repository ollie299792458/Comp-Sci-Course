I had always thought that the sequel was worse than the original.  With Shrek 2, I'm proved quite totally wrong.  Shrek 2 has the same type of biting humor, with plenty of jabs at pop culture.  It starts right where the first Shrek ended --- Fiona and Shrek go on their honeymoon.  Shrek, Fiona and Donkey then go on a 600 mile trip to Fiona's kingdom (Far, Far Away) and have "coach fever" (i.e. really get on each other's nerves).  Upon arrival, they have to Meet The In-Laws, and things don't go smoothly.  Turns out the folks aren't too happy about Fiona's husband, Shrek.  He wasn't exactly what they expected!  Unknown to Shrek, Fiona was expected to marry Prince Charming.
From here, a lot happens in a short amount of time, where Fiona's dad hires Puss In Boots to assassinate Shrek, Shrek and Fiona's love is tested and Shrek's faith in himself is pushed to its limits.  Shrek ends up in the dungeon and we meet The Muffin Man of Drury Lane (homage to Dr. Frankenstein).  All of this builds to a dramatic showdown with a very unexpected sacrifice.
Overall, it is a laugh a minute which reinforces the same morals in the first --- that appearance isn't everything.  It's an outstanding sequel and in my opinion, a must see!
