For those of us that remember the Golden Age of political and social satire - the late '60s through late '70s - this movie a complete joy. I've read many critical reviews, finding Animal House lame compared to American Pie, etc. You can't compare them. Modern film "satire", as represented by Pie, seems to equate satire with explicit references to alchohol, drugs, genitals, excrement, and sex nearly devoid of social or political context, or anything else (Christopher Guest's work is a refreshing sanctuary from this tiring trend). Animal House writers Miller, Kenney, and Ramis never delude themselves that genital jokes in themselves are satire. For these guys, a moon shot from a passing car can be funny, having to watch the same moon for the next thirty-five miles is just a bore.
Perhaps you had to be there to understand the difference. Go back and read the brilliant work of Chris Miller, Doug Kenney, and Michael O'Donoghue from Nat Lamp from 1968-1979. Or find the 
Animal House movie book (now quite rare) that provides more background (Miller's hilarious "Pinto Stories"). Then come back and opine only after you can tell us why Larry is nicknamed "Pinto".
