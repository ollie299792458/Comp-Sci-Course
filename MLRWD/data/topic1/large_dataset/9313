This 1962 black and white film is based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning book "To Kill a Mockingbird".  Gregory Peck won an Oscar for his wonderful performance as Atticus Finch, a lawyer in Alabama during the Depression.  Atticus is appointed to defend a black man who is accused of raping a white woman.  Many townspeople try to get Atticus to back out of the trial but his conscience won't let him.  Though Tom Robinson (the accused) is obviously innocent, the outcome of his trail is blatant proof of how prevalent prejudice is at that time.  Mr. Finch's conviction to defend Tom costs him some friendships but gains him respect among the black community and the admiration of his children.  
You just cannot go wrong with this movie.  It shows how kids adapt to very serious situations around them but manage to keep the innocence.  Gregory Peck should be a role model for us all.  He shows us to stand true to our convictions no matter how hard that may seem.  Winning the approval of others does not take the place of following what's in your heart.  I give him a standing ovation and 5 stars.
