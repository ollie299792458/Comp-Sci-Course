I came upon "Gormenghast" while I was flipping through the basic cable channels one night. It was the second episode, almost halfway over, and I thought it was kind of tweaked at first. I only watched it during commercial breaks for the first half hour I saw it, but something drew me. Something made me look up times that it was going to be on and tape the whole thing. Maybe it was curiosity, I don't really know, but I do know that I'm thankful that I was ensnared into the world of "Gormenghast." The rich plot is believable and the characters well portrayed. Jonothan Rhys Myers (as Steerpike), while a very attractive man, managed to come across as something twisted, malformed and neglected. Neve McIntosh played the perfect brat and flippant princess, Fuschia, Jon Sessions a wonderfully frivolous Squaller, and Colin Powrie and Andrew N. Robertson the essence of Titus Groan, the young lord who is weary of his role thrust upon him with no recourse to his feelings. While much of the story is comedic, the ending is truly powerful and you might well find yourself crying and dazed. The actors emote very well, so much that you feel yourself a part of "Gormenghast." You can see that Steerpike only wanted to be loved. You can see that one determined individual can bring down an age old society. This film (not to mention the books) reflects not just the UK, but the world, and what could happen if we allow ourselved to rot.
