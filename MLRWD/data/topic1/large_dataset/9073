I just saw this movie for the first time a few days ago and I am sorry I never discovered it sooner. What an amazing movie! I don't think I could say enough about how touching this movie is. There isn't one thing I would change about this movie. The characters are absolutely perfect! I especially liked Bud Cort's performance. I don't think there is anyone else out there that could have been a better Harold. There are so many really funny parts in this movie. I admit the whole age difference thing is kind of weird, but it just goes to show you that if you let appearances bother you, you could be passing up an amazing friend that totally changes your life for the better. That's what makes this movie so special. People not caring about what the world thinks of them. If you havn't seen this movie, I reccommend you see it as soon as possible. If you want to see a feel good movie, this is it! I think some people might think the ending is sad, but I think it has the best ending possible. It's the perfect ending if you really think about it. It was the best way to go. I couldn't give 'Harold And Maude' enough praise. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I know if you like romantic comedies, you will love this movie. Share it with everyone you know!!!
