"Battleship Potemkin" is essential viewing in learning how the language of film developed, especially the influence of Soviet theories of film montage; the juxtaposition of sequential images which comment on, reinforce, or undermine each other. This is so much a part of the language of film now that it is expected that the audience understand this vocabulary - Eisenstein was one of the most influential teachers of this filmic grammar.

The film itself, the second in an uncompleted series, "The Year 1905" (following <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053TWW6S">Strike</a>), contains powerful sequences and effectively uses the masses of people available to him in creating profound images but has less story momentum that "Strike" and less consistently masterful scene composition. In many ways <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053TWW6S">Strike</a>, in many ways the better film, has been overshadowed by "Potemkin" because of a few influential scenes.

Seen with modern eyes much of the movie is a bit clunky and heavy with propaganda (it may have even seemed heavy with propaganda then) but it had tremendous influence on the way films were made, contributed a great deal to the vocabulary of cinema, and there are segments which are affecting and still stirringly effective nearly a century later. Merely coordinating the masses of people moving through some of the scenes is an impressive feat by itself.
