Various breakdowns of plot pros and cons are available through the other reviews, so I'll address what I am most curious about with big budget movie Blu Rays. Unlike Iron Man, Kingdom of the Crytstal Skull or Hulk, Zohan has gotten it right. All of the bonus features are available on one disc. The quality of the Blu Ray picture exceeds what Zohan is able to deliver (you can clearly see when the movie is using a green screen - for a flick in New York, no idea why there isn't more filmed on location).

Most people understand that Blu Ray discs have massive amounts of storage space, far more than a 120 minute movie will take up. Every single special feature is available through the pop up menu. If you're watching the movie and want to look at the language dictionary (Zohan has its own form of yiddish), you can simply pop to it, check it out and go back to the movie in the same spot. To me, this is almost as important as the upgrade in picture quality (wich Zohan lacks due to poor implementation of green screen). All that said, it was worth it to grab on Blu Ray and be able to use all the features the format offers.

The movie is probably Sandler's weekest since Little Nicky. That said, I still laughed out loud several times and John Turturro steals every scene he's in. It tackles politics in the same manner Chuck and Larry approached gay rights, so you are likely to be offended, but at its warped core, it has a good heart. All in all, if you hate Sandler, you'll hate this, if you love him...well you get it.
