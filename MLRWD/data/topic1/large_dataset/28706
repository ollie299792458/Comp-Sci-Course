This is a beautiful film that trusts the audience to understand connections between the characters that are not explained in typical narrative and conversational scenes.  Even though I would argue that Moby Dick is the Great American Novel, I felt that Melville's overwrought novella, Billy Budd, was so drearily overwritten that ultimately Melville's meagre psychogical insight evaporated from the overegged prose.  This film does just the opposite: the scenes of the African landscape and the legionaires' bodies are not there for simple aesthetic enjoyment (although they are gorgeously rendered), but are expressionistic land- and body-scapes, the tableaux upon which the story is written.  As such, it's a film that isn't about words (quite the opposite of Melville's dire verbosity in Billy Budd), but about a vocabulary of desire (that transcends, although it also reflects, such categories as colonialism and homosexuality).  The film is Claire Denis' masterpiece to date, the best adaptation of any book I've seen, and has the most beautiful ending of any film I've seen.  I'd keep on writing and gushing hyperbolic about the film, but I think you get the point; it's one of my favourites.
