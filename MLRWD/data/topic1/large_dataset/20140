Fred always spells out his last name with a "period" and it doesn't get old.  Thus, take this review with a grain of salt as I am a very biased Sanford and Son fan.  I wasn't old enough to remember the show when it first came out, but I've been catching the re-runs all my life.
This first season is interesting in many ways.  While there isn't an Aunt Esther, or a "Grady," you can see their precursors with characters such as Aunt Hazel and Myron.  The first few episodes are interesting as well, because you notice that Lamont hasn't really found his niche yet.  He can at times be extremely hard on Fred, and push him around a bit more than you would think.
That is, until the infamous "one of these across your lips" starts to take root.  
Take note, though, that there are no "extras" found on many other DVD's these days. It is literally the episodes alone, period.  My five stars are based on the content of the shows alone, Not on DVD features, as there aren't any.
Yet, the shows are so good, that if you are even remotely interested in Sanford and Son, you should buy this.  Some of these had me laughing so hard I was crying, and even the ones that don't make me laugh out loud always bring a smile to my face.  Fred takes you to a happier place and time, with simple pleasures, and great guffaws.  Highly recommended.
