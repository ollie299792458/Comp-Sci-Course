WOW!  Where does one begin writing about such a powerful movie?
Billy Bob Thornton plays the unfeeling, unemotional, robot of a man...(He plays him superbly) He comes from a generation of robotic sleeze balls.
How apt that he is one of the gaurds at the prison who executes Halle Barry's husband (Puffy.)
Halle plays her role (No makeup, still stunning) as a sort of welfare, desparate, pathetic soul...probably also from a generation of dysfunction.
Billy and Halle meet somehow---both filling a hole in one another.  Somehow it works.  Somehow they become better people because of it.
There is a scene where Billy Bob Thorton is painting the inside of his house white...(symbolic for a new beginning)
There are scenes where the viewer will see hands reaching into a cage recovering a bird... (Another metaphor for freedom, change, letting go)
This is one of the best movies I have ever watched...
Halle is superb, deserving of the acadamy award.
Thornton is brilliant as her sleeze ball boyfriend turned human.
Looooooooove it!!!!
PS... beware, the scenes of Barry beating her son is very raw and disturbing, but the directer makes the viewer see that she too, has been in this abusive cycle for many years.
This is not a movie you will soon forget...the images will stay with you and make every emotion surface.
