I was rendered speechless after viewing this movie, if you can call it that. This film hardly seems like a movie, the characters are that real. Celine and Jesse spend one night together in Vienna and make a connection that is surreal to them and to the audience. Both actors (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) pull off amazing performances in that it is difficult to believe they are acting. The entire film is several sets of long dialogue, unbroken by separate camera shots so much had to be done in one take. The vision of director Richard Linklighter is daring and courageous, as he lets moments of silence, awkward spaces in between conversations, happen between these two just as they would in any real conversation. The movie is not programmed for your attention span, it is simply set out for you as it really happened, or would happen.

At the end of this film, you feel for these people so strongly not because of sweeping background music or witty banter, but because they are so real to you.

By looking at the cover photo of this DVD, one would instantly write it off as a chick flick, but this romance is one that men and women can enjoy.

Go into it knowing that it will be slow paced, and appreciate that fact.

Its unlike any movie you have ever seen.
