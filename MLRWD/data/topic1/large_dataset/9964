well now, i rented this movie out of curiousity. The cover intrigued me. I love horror movies. This movie is not what I thought it was. The MUSIC IS ANNOYING. The dialogue is too dumb to be shocking. the way they dubbed it is very sub-par. and the animals look like they are really suffering. I am not in Peta, but, this movie overdoes it with the animals. it seems linda like they put it in there only as a filler, or t shock people. and them comes the castraion. ew. i really wanted to see that [person]bastard get his. but, all the torture in this movie makes me question my own integrity in renting a movie simply because of the cover. Torture in this movie is not acted well at all. Theres hardly any cannibalism. theres some, but not enough. the end result of the hot blonde chick is disgusting,(...). nice. i would not recommend this to anyone unless u hate aminals and love watching pretty people get hurt. no one has mentioned the over-used curse words. but holy hell, the TW word and the CU word are synonimous for BAD MOVIE!!!!
