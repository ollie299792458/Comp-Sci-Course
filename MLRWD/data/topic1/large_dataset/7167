The movie to prove to anyone that blondes, too can be intellegent humans.  Here comes Elle Woods decked out in an all pink outfit with her long glorious blonde hair, president of her uber cool soriority.  She has it all; a 4.0 GPA, a handsome droolworthy boyfriend, and the best friends any girl could have.  One night, she swarms around her soriority estatic, for tonight is the night her boyfriend Warner will propose.  She fantasizes over his proposal, accepting the ring, and dreaming of how the ring will look.
She arrives at dinner with Warner, and things don't go as expected.  Warner tells her he needs to find a "more intellegent" women to meet up with his parents standards.  Elle starts panicking in the resteraunt and her mascara drips from her blue eyes as she's faced with the worse nightmare ever!
Despite Elle's straight A's and major in Polka Dots, she applies to Harvard, passing a standarized test, and sending in a lengthy video.  She moves to a new area, befriends a manicurist, and tries to find Warner. 
Shockingly, Warner has found a chick of his own; someone totally opposite of Elle.  Watch the rest of the movie to laugh over Elle and her very brilliant mind at court cases and in classrooms. 
A truly "Barbie" girl movie.
