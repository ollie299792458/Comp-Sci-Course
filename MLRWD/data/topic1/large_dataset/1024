The plot has been discussed by dozens of previous reviewers.  The movie has been picked apart by people who hated it.
All I add is this: this is without a doubt my favorite vampire movie of all time.  The scenes are breathtaking.  The acting IS spotty at times, but hey.  The story is good.  I think the reason I like it so much is that I prefer more "realistic" vampires, if you can even talk of such a thing.  If there WERE such a thing as vampires, they would be like the monsters in this movie.  And if there WERE people who hunted them, they would probably be like the people in this movie.
This movie has a lot of replay value - I absolutely had to have it in my collection.  I've watched it many, many times.
As far as the DVD edition is concerned, I so much enjoyed watching it with John Carpenter's commentary turned on.
There have been so many negative reviews, there must be SOMETHING that is turning the average viewer off, though.  My advice: rent it first.  You'll either hate it, or (like me) you'll love it and know that you have to own it.
