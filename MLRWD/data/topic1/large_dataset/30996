This is a great story...and with a cast that includes Henry Fonda in the title role, Jimmy Cagney as an irratable and envious Ship's Captain, Jack Lemmon as the immortalized Ensign Pulver and William Powell as the wordly ship's physician, it is a great film as well.
It's a tale that spins a number of universal stories, all at the same time. Primarily, it's the story of Mr. Roberts (Henry Fonda) stuck on a supply ship and bemoaning his missing the war. It's also the story of Cagney's character, an aging Captain, who's seen tons of "college boys" pass him over during his career. In Roberts, he sees the chance to even out the scales by keeping the college educated Roberts stuck on the USS Liberty. Moreover it's the story of Jack Lemmon's character, Ensign Pulver, who is forced to mature when he's thrust into the vacuum left after Mr. Roberts finally gets his transfer.
The backdrop for all this is the story of men under the stress of war...in the case of supply ships like the Liberty, that stress is set in the boredom, monotony and incessant hard labor with only rare and fleeting opportunities to blow off steam.
This is a great flick. It entertains us with the most entertaining subject of all...the flaws and foibles inherant in human nature.
