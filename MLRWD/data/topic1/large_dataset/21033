Undoubtedly the best of the 4 Die Hards and possibly the best action film ever made!  It is definately my favorite action film.  John McClaine is visiting his estranged wife at her office, the new Nakatomi building in Los Angeles.  The office is celebrating both Christmas and the opening of the new building.  Suddenly the building is invaded by what appear to be some heavily armed and very high tech terrorists who seal off the building and take all the employees prisoner.  John, a New York cop realizes what is happening and hides out in the empty part of the new building until he can access the situation and forge a plan of action.

Against impossible odds, McClaine must save the hostages and convince the unbelieving Los Angeles police department what is going on before the terrorists can complete their evil plot.  This is a movie that will have you cheering out loud and cringing at the dangerous situations that keep presenting themselves.  There are alot of excellent supporting characters, including Al the disgraced patrol car cop as well as probably one of the suavest villians ever.
