The opening of this film is superior to that of his Renaissance giallo `Suspiria' its a full on assault on your senses But I wont spoil it, or will I be travelling at night on a train for a while.
There are 2 ways you can rate this film, for its murder set pieces or for Storyline , for the first it stands head above shoulders better than any Hollywood tripe, this has some very very nasty voyeuristcally sadistic killings, It left a very bad taste in my mouth and I'm not a horror wimp ,  lets just say some poor gal got a mouthful of music like you can't imagine. This film is a good enough start to Argentos millennial debut but the storyline starts promising and no thanks to such poor dubbing on the VHS the end conclusion is incoherent , and your left feeling like you've half wasted your time,  as Argento fans will know this is same old problem that ruins his films. In the dubbing we get American / Cockney / italian characters and its just stupid , all his artistry is sacrificed by this which will culminate in 'Virgin viewers' blaming the director- and fair enough they lace the mans wallet. On the + side  Max Von Sydow gives a pretty good performance I cant tell if the other actors were incompetent or let down by bad dubbing.
 For entertainment the film does deliver but you need a strong stomach to watch this , Argento anoraks will love it and you'll need an anorak its bloodsoaked, if you want a story though rent Snow White.
By the way Dario's answer to why he kills so many women is simple `his mum never let him leave the light on and he thought of her as a monster' , Can you imagine being his enemy ?
