I wish I had read some of the reviews here before ordering this DVD.  Many of the reviewers have spoken of the terrible sound, and they are correct.  I guess this is what one must expect when people in love with technology approach a work of art.  The supposedly enhanced sound ruins the movie.  I have watched only a few minutes of this DVD, and I will never watch it again, even though A Hard Day's Night is one of my favorite movies.  I should probably study this fiasco a little more before writing this review to verify what I'm going to say, but I'm so disgusted that I can't wait.  Although I have read 30 or 40 of the reviews here, I haven't seen a couple of particular complaints mentioned.  My apologies if someone has already written about them.  In the performance of "If I Fell," I believe the released recording has replaced the "live" version the Beatles recorded for the movie.  To synchronize the video with the sound, Miramax has slowed down the latter!  The music is about a half-step off.  Later, during the big TV performance toward the end of the movie, the producers have removed the ambient sound, so one gets no sense of the audience's wild excitement.  Because I couldn't watch any more than this, I'm probably missing many other transgressions.  I can't imagine what Miramax was thinking when they released this.  I will never again let my eagerness to own a DVD permit me to order it before reading reviews, but how could I have anticipated a disgrace of this caliber?  I'm thankful I have the VHS copy I recorded off cable many years ago.
