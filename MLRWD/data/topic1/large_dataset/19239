I fondly remember some of the old shows of Superman that featured George Reeves.  In this film they try to show some of the mystery that surrounds the murder.  The problem I had with this film is that although it did show some of the alarming evidence that pointed to Reeves Death not being a suicide, it tends to get a bit clustered.  Diane Lane also has a role in this film and she is great.  Unfortunately despite some of the big name actors this film has in it, it is not really that thoughtful in the approach of digging into the crime itself.  It tends to just wrap up more as a drama based around big rollers in Hollywood.  I realize this is part of the story, and that the story must be told.  Ben Affleck is not bad cast as Reeves, but some of the sub plots that are thrown into the mix make me want to read more on the crime itself.  In other words, I honestly don't know what in the film was a truth and how much of it was just more Hollywood fiction.  Brody is great as a private detective who is against all odds in finding the truth, and it is his sole portrayal of a man who finds more questions than answers that makes the film worthy.

Shining moments do rise, but unless someone is interested in the possibility of his death being a murder, I doubt many will find the film worth renting.
