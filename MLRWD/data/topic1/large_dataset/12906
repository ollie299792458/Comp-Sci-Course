To understand this movie you must first understand Ayn Rand's conceptualization of altruism, its evils, the evil of those who try to "sell" altruism and especially those who try to sell the concept through the guise of religion.  Altruism is ultimately self-sacrifice, a full denigration of the self.

"Do not confuse altruism with kindness, good will or respect for the rights of others. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruism makes impossible. The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute, is self-sacrifice--which means; self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial, self-destruction--which means: the self as a standard of evil, the selfless as a standard of the good." - Ayn Rand

Major lessons of this movie: 1) There is no such thing as a free lunch and 2) never, EVER atone for someone else's sins.

There are actually TWO solutions to the dilemma: 1) do not press the button and 2) leave the son blind and deaf.  Why (2)?  First, realize that the dead people and crippled son were the result of someone else's evil deeds and NOT YOURS TO ATONE FOR.  With the mother dead and the father in prison, the son is left parentless and as a ward of the state, presumably with no one fighting in his best interests any longer.  The best thing was for the parents to have realize the morality of staying alive to continue to fight to have the problem corrected in another way.

I suggest that those that do not understand this movie do not understand altruism for what it actually is.
