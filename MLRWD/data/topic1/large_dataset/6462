A very interesting movie, although difficult to watch.  It really rings home, posing the question  . . . how much do you really know about those closest to you.  And how are you actions perceived by them, relative to the innocent or innocuous manner in which they may have been intended.

Apparently the minutiae of his life were subjected to the most detailed scrutiny by his wife, and she didn't like what she found.  Some of what he did may have been beyond the pale, but apparently he did nothing knowingly to harm her or their children.

Was there really enough of a reason  for her to do what she did or was she over-reacting.  Was there something else she could have done, perhaps earlier in their marriage, that would give him the opportunity to respond in a meaningful way?  One could not but blame her, perhaps more than him, for what happened.  Did she ever really love him?

It demonstrates, in the extreme, the characteristic some husbands assign to their wives  . . . her being angry but not telling him why she is angry  . . .
