I recently saw this film on a dvd issued from France with supplements of interviews with
famed French director Bertrand Tavernier and the director himself.  The former heaped
praises on the film and its director in a typical French indulgent way.

The film was basically divided into 3 parts.
The first part was played out like a stage play, taking place inside a bar cum hotel, setting
up the conflicts between the Robert Ryan character and the other farmers.
That first part was not particularly well written or played.
The 2nd part started with the arrival of the renegade Burl Ives character and his henchmen who
were basically cardboard western baddie characters.
The final part involved impressive wintery outdoor photography while Robert Ryan led the renegade
group up the snowy mountain to their cliche endings.
This is a low-budget B-western with several obvious continuity and editing problems.  Some of supporting actors
gave stiff or below standard performances, e.g. the young girl who fell for David Nelson character.
Somehow the director lingered on her close-up shot even though it should belong to cutting room
floor.
This question may be a bit too late but someone should have asked Andre de Toth if all the sufferings
of human and animal was worth for this slight film.
