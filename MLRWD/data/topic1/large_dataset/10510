I have been practicing yoga for a few years and didn't want to give up an effective workout once I got pregnant. I want to maintain my strength as well as practice poses that will assist me with a non-medicated natural childbirth. This DVD set is great. I prefer the long form but it is nice to have the short forms on days when I get home from work and just need to get in a short workout before dinner.  I am in my 2nd trimester and find the long and short forms all perfectly challenging without tempting me to push myself too much. There are also helpful modifications for when my belly gets too big. Please note that I would not recommend this if you are new to yoga, I would recommend trying the Shiva Rae DVD which is much slower paced and less challenging. This DVD is much more challenging than the prenatal yoga classes that are available through Destination Maternity in my area - I don't know if this is normal or not, no true yoga studios nearby offer prenatal.  I feel like a lot of prenatal yoga is geared toward women that are just starting up and not for more experienced yogis.  Hope this helps and good luck throughout your pregnancy!
