I have watched this movie about 50 times now, and my best friend and I pride ourselves on being able to recall all of the dialogue!  It is a must for Lisa Kudrow fans since her performance as Michele almost completely mirrors her role as Phoebe on the popular TV show Friends.  At age 29, I would have been a sophomore in high school when Romy and Michele graduated; the "A" group closely mirrored the "Class Officers" of my school - pretty cheer-leader types who nice to you when they wanted to be, but usually stuck-up and pretentious, hiding their own insecurities behind mall hair and too much foundation.
The secret to enjoying this movie is to watch Lisa Kudrow's facial expressions and hang on to her every word..."God, this underwear is TOTALLY riding up my buttcrack".  If you don't enjoy Kudrow, then you will get hung up on the various small flaws the movie has (like the long dream sequence).  
I put this movie in the same category as Caddyshack, Meatballs, and National Lampoon's Vacation.
