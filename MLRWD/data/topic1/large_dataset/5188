Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham (translated to: Sometimes there is happiness, sometimes there is sadness) is a story about relationships between parents and children, between husband and wife and between siblings.  This movie has a great cast, wonderful songs and a good storyline.  The acting across the board is great with Shah Rukh Khan and Amitabh Bachan being the stand out stellar performances.  The character development is excellent, you can completely identify with the characters.  The chemistry between Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol is believable and touching.  Kareena Kapoor and Hrithik Roshan's pair is funny and nice also.

The first half of the movie is flashback. The first half of the movie is pretty good overall with a little lull in between.  There are some emotional scenes and some funny ones. The second half is perfect. It will make you alternate between laughing out loud or crying in some scenes.

The only criticisms I have with this movie is Johnny Lever is annoying in the first half (he doesn't come in the second half thank goodness) and Kajol overacts at being Punjabi in the first half a little. This movie is like a breath of fresh air after watching "Family Stone" and other American movies where people have sex and/or great drunk or alternately "fall in love" after one meeting and there is no character development or a sense of love on a mental or emotional level.  In Bollywood and in Hollywood directors seem to think less character development or the less wholesome a story the better.  But in reality after seeing how much people like this movie or wonderful American movies like Secondhand Lions, movie producers and directors should understand that there is still an audience for these kinds of family oriented movies.
