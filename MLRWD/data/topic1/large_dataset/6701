I wasn't originally interested in this film. I thought, "Oh, it's another boxing movie." Even seeing a few clips out of context, I didn't think it was going to hold my attention. But, with the awards it won this year, I figured I'd give it a shot. I am so glad I did. I was hooked every second. Everyone did a phenomenal job playing these real people. After watching the "making of" video included in the special features of the BD, you will understand how great of a job they really did. I was amazed particularly at Christian Bale's performance. He deserved his Acadamy award, he became Dicky Eklund: look, mannerisms, voice, everything.

I would almost say Christian Bale was the real star/main character of the movie. The focus seemed to be around him more than Mark Wahlberg, even though it followed Micky Ward's early career. Although, it's really the whole family, and their dynamic that is the main character/focus of the film. Yeah, it's a movie about a fighter, but that's just the setup, it's a prop. The movie is about this family, specifically the brothers and their love.

This isn't just a movie for guys that want to see something about a "fighter." This is a movie for men and women, both, with elements that everyone will enjoy.
