Normally there is somewhat of a plot or situation to the better Wiggles DVDs (ie Wiggly Safari, Top of the Tots, the Christmas specials). There is no plot to this one at all, just heavy dose of the pirates doing very little and the Wiggles singing indoors (!)with their back up dancers wearing weird-looking tunics or on the Big Red Boat. After the first song involving the Big Red Car, there is no following mention of it. Why name the video/DVD "Here Comes the Big Red Car" if you are only gong to feature it once?

The songs are either re-treads ("Can You Point Your Fingers and Do the Twist") or just really bad songs (I still don't understand what "Doing the Flap" is about and "Nicky Nacky Nocky Noo" and "Di Dickie Do Dum" doesn't have words clear enough for most children to understand or sing themselves, thus fails to keep their attention).

It was also quite short, which suprised my family (72 minutes when including all the bonus features - which includes two episodes of their Lights, Camera, Action, Wiggles! series).  The extras are awful. There is an animated story about Anthony painting and decorating his entire room blue that really has no point or lesson to it and Dorothy's Special Announcements (which involve her saying good night and brushing her teeth - really that is all).

Everyone in our household gave it a thumbs down. Terrible waste of money.
