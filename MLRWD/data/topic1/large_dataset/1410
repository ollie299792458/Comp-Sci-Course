Hackers: Dade Murphy moves to New York with his mother after a 7 year ban from computers, because of a computer virus he wrote as a kid that crashed 1507 computers in one day.  In New York, at his new school he meets some hackers and learns the hacker lifestyle in NY.  One of the hackers, the amateur Joey, stumbles upon a scheme to steal $25 million from a large oil company, Ellingson Mineral, by the hacker The Plague, who is actually the computer head of security for the company.  Plague discovers the hackers have discovered his plan and insertes a virus into Ellingsons computer systems that will cause a disaster and blames it on the hackers.  Now the hackers must stop the virus and catch Plague in the act before he makes off with the money in order to clear their names.

I've loved this movie since its theatrical release.  Its a very basic story and not so technicalny audience can understand it.  The characters are great and the performances are sufficient; though this isn't supposed to be an award winning film, just a good fun film.  And it defiitely is fun, very enjoyable.  The soundtrack, effects, colors and lifestyle add to the excitement of the techno-lives of hackers.  It's a great film, i highly recommend it.
