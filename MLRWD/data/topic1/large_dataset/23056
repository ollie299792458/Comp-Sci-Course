As long as you go into this movie aware that it 1. Does NOT have Micheal Myers in it 2. is NOT a slasher movie 3. Why it was written and how 4. What kind of movie it is INTENDED to be....  you should be pretty happy.

if you don't understnad all that, you'l probably call it "horrible. terrible nonsensical story, with arbitrary scares and completely useless rehash OUT OF THE BLUE of classic Micheal Myers music"

but really, it's a sci-fi B-movie horror flick.  it's weird and cheesy and creepy and poorly acted and the script fails in maybe departments, mainly.... WHY DOES the main character get so involved in this plot?
But i totally dig it.... but i think maybe my "suspension of disbelief" might have a higher threshold than most.

here's the synopsis.  A doctor witness a man come into the ER holding halloween mask, GRIPPING it.  later that man dies with the mask. the Doctor, (who did NOT work on all that much on this patient) decides he HAS to find out whatwas going on, and in his investigation is contacted by a relative of the man who died.
they uncover a sinister, mystical plot by the company that makes that mask that will culminate on halloween.  Can they save the day??

ironically, the "mystical" portion of that plot was the basis for the playing out of the Micheal Myers character in the H4,5,6.
