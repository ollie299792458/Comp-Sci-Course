I have often said, not only is this movie good as a Star Trek film, it's just a good movie, period.  Undoubtedly the best Star Trek film to date.

Patrick Stewart, as usual, does an excellent job.  I love his acting style, his passion for his role is unmatched.

The interraction between the crew.. it is not a stretch of the imagination to believe that these people know and care for one another.  The subtle nuances of expression, most especially with Riker, Data, Picard, and Worf, add believabilty and humanity to their acting.

Lilly, excellent character development and a wonderful performance.

And of course the plot and action.  No holes, not a dull moment nor any excess/uneeded details.

In times likes these, I find myself gravitating towards the Star Trek universe.  This movie certainly delivers the feeling that, if one man could have such a marvelous and hopeful vision for the future and could see the potential inherent in humankind, perhaps it is not impossible that those in power today could also see it and strive for it.
