This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! The cast are some of the most talented actors in Hollywood today. The Departed put Matt Damon on the map for me. And Leonardo Dicaprio...forget it. He is absolutely amazing as the tortured William Costigan Jr. I have seen this movie no less than 50 times. I'm actually watching it right now. I'm not a huge fan of "gangster" flicks, but this one is perfect. As the viewer, we know everything that the characters are trying to figure out, but what keeps us on the edge is wondering how it's going to be played out. Will the cops figure out who Costello's rat is? Will Costello figure out who's undercover? There is so much cursing, too, which is wonderful!! Personally, cussing is a constant in my circle, but if you have sensitive ears, you might need to steer clear...

The soundtrack is also terrific. The Dropkick Murphy's Shipping up to Boston is a key element and just seems to fitting to this movie. I love everything about this movie.!!!
