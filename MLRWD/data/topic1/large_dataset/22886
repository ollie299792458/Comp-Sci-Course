Scream of Fear is an absolute classic movie. When I discovered it was available (with 3 other movies) on the Hammer Films DVD I had to purchase it. I wasn't interested in the other films to be honest, but it was so reasonably priced that it was worth purchasing.

For people that have seen Scream of Fear, you will never forget it. It's a real mystery film that will keep you intrigued until the very end. It's maybe not as scary as it would have been back when it was made but it is still creepy, so it's not overly dated.

I enjoyed the movie as much as I did when I first saw it. The DVD transfer is of high quality. My old VHS copy of this movie was starting to deteriorate so I am pleased that I now have a DVD copy.

If you have ever seen Scream of Fear I would recommend purchasing this DVD. Even if you haven't seen it before, you are in for a real treat. I'm sure in the future I will watch the other movies contained on this 2 disc set, but for now I am more than satisfied at owning this DVD just for Scream of Fear alone. If this film were more mainstream I'm sure they would have remade it by now. Maybe it's better that it hasn't been remade though because the original is just perfect.
