So many times I see that people critique movies, such as this one. "Scary Movie" got that treatment, and this one will as well. I even saw one person review it before watching it, giving it the worst score. How is that?
Scary Movie 2 doesn't portray itself to be some meaningful movie, where there is a message involved. There is no message involved, and there wasn't meant to be a message involved. It's a movie that tries to get you to poke fun at the horror/supernatural movies out there, and it shows you that not everything should be taken so seriously.
If you want to go see a meaningful story with a message, I hear that "A.I." is good. However, if you want something that shouldn't be taken so seriously, try out "Scary Movie 2". You'll see stuff so outrageous that it will be funny.
I saw it and I didn't regret it. I expected a not-so-serious movie this time around and I knew what I was going to see, and that's why this was funny.
Stop critiquing movies so much and chill out a bit. Have fun. Life is too short to be so serious.
