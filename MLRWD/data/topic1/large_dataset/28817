Spongebob was first originated from the TV show back in 1999. Ever since it has become one of the most popular and funny TV shows ever. Nickelodeon thought of making a movie for this.

The movie is about two friends who go and save the King's crown on their own because they were forced and tricked by the evil Plankton. I am a huge spongebob fan and I watched the movie several times and it turned out to be really good.

The makers of spongebob wanted to make this movie really funny. When that happens the jokes turn out to be dumb, and that's exactly what happened in this movie. The jokes got a little weird and dumb, and it wasn't really funny after all. Normally, if the show is funny, the movie will be even more. But it didn't really happen here. I think any spongebob show is funnier than watching this movie. The jokes in the movie are okay.

Overall, the movie was entertaining and fun. If you are a spongebob fan, I suggest you watch this movie. It is really good, lacking a little laughter. More or less, it deserves 4 stars.
