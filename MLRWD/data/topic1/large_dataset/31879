I've noticed that people either love or hate this film. I've also noticed that the ones that hated it tended to be people ignorant of the details & circumstances of Basquiat's life. Something tells me that, when appreciating this film, it really helps if one is deeply interested in the subjects. 
Basically, if you feel that Warhol was unimaginative, or that contemporary art is obtuse & undignified, you probably won't like this film. Go watch M-TV or something.
My big gripe is that Miramax hasn't released this beauty on DVD yet.(*) I mean, come on! It's been, what, 5 years since it's release? Schnabel's second film, Before Night Falls, won Oscars, and you'd think that that alone would garner enough attention to get this work released in the format it deserves. Nope. &lt;sigh!> I just don't get it. If it came out on DVD I garuntee you that I'd buy it, friends of mine would buy it, my school's English department would buy it (heck, they already brought it to the campus theater for a "Film as Narrative Art" class). 
So, Miramax, what gives?
(*) It seems that somebody, somewhere likes me.  Not only does it look like there will indeed be a dvd edition, but it's coming out a week before my birthday (according to the fine folks at Amazon).  Whoo-hoo!
