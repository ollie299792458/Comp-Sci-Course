In "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf", Elizabeth Taylor says "something doesn't have to cause a 'gut-busting' laugh just to be funny."  The same - paraphrased - can be said of the Monogram Charlie Chan movies.

Sidney Toler, Mantan Moreland and any of the Chan offspring never won any Academy Awards, critical acclaim or broke any box office records.  But each one of these films was produced to keep Monogram Pictures alive and movie-goers coming back to see the latest "whodunit" and every one of these is entertaining.

The villians were villianous, the detectives smart and the police were dedicated public servants.  I didn't need a dictionary or a blueprint to follow the story and I definitely felt as if I got my money's worth.

MGM has all but disavowed producing the Chanthology Boxed set due, regrettably, to political correctness so along with the Tom & Jerry cartoons (and I'm not talking about the cat and mouse) don't expect these films to be available in an uncensored version in the future.

When these are gone, they're gone!
