This film  is a superlative memorial to those men of both sides that participated in the epic fight over the skies of Great Briatain and the English Channel back in 1940.  At the time this film was made, the producers had spent several years scouring The British Isles and the Continent for flyable aircraft that were appropriate for the period, a daunting task.  That they found over 50 servicable planes to use in flying and static scenes is all the more remarkable.  They were able to film on location at some of the original RAF bases with the cooperation of the Ministry of Defense.  The cast is stellar, and the film's language and presentation is authentic for the period. Special effects are state of the art for the time, and are impressive in that context.  I watch the film annually on the anniversary of the BOB. There used to be a gathering at the old Reggie's Pub at the Omni complex in Atlanta on the same day, and you'd meet veterans from both sides there most years.  This film honors them all.
