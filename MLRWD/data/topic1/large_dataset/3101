This movie was, in two words, entirely unique. 
They're promoting it as a 'romantic comedy' -- because there's no category called 'psychotic affair with undertones of love and violent outbursts'. 
Much like Magnolia (the director's previous film), this is unlike any film you've ever seen. 
Adam Sandler does an excellent job of playing an unremarkable plunger salesman -- Barry Egan. There is nothing special about this guy. He has the odd phobia, and is a little paranoid and superstitious, but is generally an all-around nice guy... if a little temperamental. An average American.
He is also painfully lonely; so much so, in fact, that one day he calls a 1-800 sex line just so he can talk to someone... 
The soundtrack & audio in the film are integral to the experience of it, which is completely unnerving.
It definitely arouses feelings in the audience -- mostly of unease, and awkwardness... and I laughed many times because of the absurdity of the situations -- all of which were completely intentional on the director's part (Paul Thomas Anderson). 
Amazing, unique film.
It is NOT what you're expecting... no matter what.
