I don't usually watch westerns but when my father told me about this movie, and I saw the awe that filled his eyes, I knew I had to watch it. I did and I was enchanted by everything about it. I loved the performances of Tom Berenger as the tormented Lewis Gates, Barbara Hershey as the bookish anthropologist Lillian and especially, Zip, the scrappy little bob-tailed dog that had so much personality! I also enjoyed Wilford Brimley's narration throughout the movie - it was entirely believable because he is so down to earth. The story is slightly implausible, bordering on fantasy - a bounty hunter and an anthropologist find a "lost" tribe of Cheyenne Indians living in an incredibly remote area of Montana. But the movie is so well done you find yourself wishing it were true. The actors who potrayed members of the lost tribe - especially the man who played Lone Wolf - were extremely authentic without being caricatures or stereotpyes. And the music - this movie wouldn't be as good without that marvelous music. And last but not least, the scenery. The mountains, the rivers where the escaped convicts and later Lewis run for fresh water - made me wonder if such a place really exists. This is a must-have movie best viewed when you are in need of hope and a reason to feel good about the world. And sometimes I wonder if Lillian and Lewis "lived happily ever after" with that lost tribe. I sure hope so!
