If you liked the Beavis and Butt-head TV show, you'll like the movie.
I happened to love it, not just because I like B&amp;B, but also because one of the major themes of the movie fits perfectly with some of my observations.  The movie goes out of its way to show how stupid Beavis and Butt-head are, and then goes on and shows them completely outsmarting all of American law enforcement and the entire US Federal Government.  And in the end (huh-huh), despite the presence of the army, the FBI, the ATF, the Secret Service, and a bunch of cops, it is Butt-head, a completely clueless moron, who saves the day.  
Besides that, the movie is jam-packed with loads (huh-huh) of hilarious moments and scenes.  There are literally dozens of laugh-out-loud moments.  The opening credits are great.  The beginning of the film is great.  The scene by the campfire in the desert (I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie, but listen closely for the voice of David Letterman in that scene) is brilliant.  Butt-head's line right after getting searched by a law enforcement officer (I don't want to ruin this one with more details either) gave me one of the biggest laughs.
