Some Like it hot is the name of the movie I reviewed. The film was done in the 50's and is in black and white.The director of this movie was Billy Wilder, he has also directed a film called The Apartment. The protagonist  in this film were the two main actors Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe. The  antagonists were the maufia me. The genre of the film was comedy. The basic  plot was of two men who wanted a musician job and the best one available  was for women. They decide to dress like women and take the job. Tony  Curtis falls in love with Marilyn Monroe and doesn't tell her he is a male  until the end of the movie. She wants a rich man which he pretends to be.  Then at the end of the movie he tells her he isn't rich but she doesn't  care because she loves him. The major conflict is that the characters play  women which they really aren't. The film this reminds me of is  called  Ladybugs starring Rodney Dangerfeild. The reason I say this is because it  is of a man who dresses as a woman and falls in love with a girl and at the  end they love eachother. I would highly recommend this movie. It was very  funny and I found it to be an oldie but goodie because of the good cast and  plot that is irresistable.
