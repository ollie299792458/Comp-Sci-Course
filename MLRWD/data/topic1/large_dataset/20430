IMO, a superlative combination of performance, stagecraft and songwriting. The story brings into high relief the paradox of artist worship- Dot loves George most of all for his painting, to be immortalized in his medium. The obsession that makes George's art so great is the very thing that prevents him from giving her what she really needs: commitment, connection. 
The music, while lacking the catchy, hummable tunes of mainstream Broadway, tellingly evokes Seurat's Divisionist painting style and limns the jarring temporal dislocations of the stage effects and scene transitions. 
The video may not have the gloss and precision of the original cast recording, but brings more strongly characterized and muscular performances from the cast and orchestra, vividly highlighting the brilliant orchestration. Patinkin's Seurat is more masculine, more French; Peters serves up her dialogue more naturally. The DVD commentary gives some interesting insights into the creation of this work, and shows a revealing portrait of the principals- Patinkin intense, passionate, narcissistic; Peters charming, laid-back, but somewhat less intellectually engaging. 
Highlights for me include the splendid opening number, the remarkable blending of song, dialogue and musical illustration in "Color and Light" and "Finishing the Hat", the rich didactics of "Beautiful" and "Children and Art". A real connoisseur's piece!
