This is what storytelling is about - and it proves the possibilities of the SF genre: While mainstream dramas often sacrifice their subject to public taste by softening it or going for laughs, the genre film has the chance to explore subjects in all their consequence behind the facade of phantastic gadgets. "The Man with the X-Ray Eyes" is the perfect proof of J.G. Ballards thesis that science fiction is THE fiction genre of the 20th century. Ray Milland alias X is the true visionary, may he be scientist, artist or philosopher, who sees his talent either misinterpreted or exploited (or both). The film's essential line is X's statement that he is no prophet, that he can only look and tell what he sees. Which makes him the perfect outsider of course (people want RELIEF) , if he is not able to hide or catalyze his ability. And his inner driving force will never stop - possibly resulting in introversion, megalomania, madness, selfdestruction or ...? "The Man with the X-Ray Eyes" has no hope to offer - knowing is suffering, as the Greeks would have put it.
Sure, some of the effects are phoney, and a few scenes (like the overlong title sequence) don't work - but these are 5 minutes out of 80. This is thought-provoking stuff, one of the primemovers of "serious" SF - see it!
(Great DVD transfer, too.)
