There can be no doubt, as if there ever was. Michael Jordan may be the most recognisable, astounding and truely awe-inspiring athelete to ever grace our life time.

I am privileged to be one of millions who watched him demolish the league all throughout the 90's. I remain, to this day, a fan.

This 3 disc edition of a previously released DVD set, includes, as additional bonuses, a select few of Jordan's most memorable games in their entirety without the commercials. The "Flu Game", Boston 63 pts, Cleveland 69 pts and others.....FANTASTIC!

The videos we've all seen before, but what a trip down memory lane, who could ever grow tired of watching His Airness doing what he does best. Air Time, Playground, Come Fly With Me and others..... BREATHTAKING!

Even if you're not a Jordan nut, maybe just a basketball fan... even if you just like sports in general. Do yourself a favour and allow yourself this highly, highly recommended indulgence...... MARVELLOUS!
