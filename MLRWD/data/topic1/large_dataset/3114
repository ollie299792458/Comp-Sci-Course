Fans of the Waugh novel should be warned: the spirit of this film is extremely faithful to the book, but author-director Fry has changed many of the details, especially involving what finally happens to the central couple, Adam and Nina. Vile Bodies was hailed (and blasted) when it first appeared in print as being one of the first "modern" novels, adopting the disconnected, racy pace of modern life. Waugh himself thought it the first book to feature a great many telephone conversations. The film is very much like that, with abundant quick cuts and a tempo so hurried you never quite get to absorb a scene. It's still wonderful--very witty when it keeps close to Waugh (and even when it doesn't) and quite elaborate in its art direction. The cast is filled with cameos by the great and near great. John Mills is very effective without a single spoken line, and Fry himself appears (I think) as a chauffeur in one brief episode. Julia McKenzie is terrific--I got more out of her than I did out of all the episodes of The Duchess Of Duke Street, supposedly based on the character she plays. It's fascinating, too, to see how Gilbert from Topsy-Turvy turns into the "drunk major" who may or may not be trying to pay Adam the unholy fortune he has won on a horse. I was disappointed that Fry left out Nina's father's obsession with the movies. But you can't get of a book into a film.
