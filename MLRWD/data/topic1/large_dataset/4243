i came across this film upon the news that rhys ifans may play one of the villains in an upcoming james bond flick.  if those rumors hold true, they have made one of the most bold and invigorating choices in the new bond enterprise.  while most focus on the chemistry between the leading man and the leading woman, this film derives most of its strength from the acidic chemistry between the protagonist, played by daniel craig, and antagonist, played by rhys ifans.  to call the dance these two actors perform twisted and shocking does not even begin to scratch the surface, this film deals with some of the deeper aspects of life while problematizing them with the distortions that obsession creates.  this film offers no answers, it solves no riddles, but in its journey into the depths of these character's lives, it manages to evoke gut-wrenching emotions and summon about unlikely moments of outright cinematic beauty.  i strongly recommend this film for all those who enjoy independent film and character driven story.  daniel craig displays some of his best in this film.
