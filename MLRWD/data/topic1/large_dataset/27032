Campbell Scott plays Roger--a "ladies man" on the prowl for his next victim.  Roger takes his 16-year old nephew under his wing to teach him the ropes.  In the end, it just may be the nephew who does the teaching.
The more I think back on it, the more I end up liking this movie.  The very underrated Campbell Scott pulls off a brilliant performance.  And it's hard to believe this is the debut of first-time director Dylan Kidd.  His script is polished and very sharp.  And although the picture is mostly dark, the colors are really vibrant.  I don't agree with the shaky-cam (a technique Kidd says he'll go to his grave defending), but I wasn't nearly distracted by it either.
So, the movie's good...but the DVD makes it a must-own.  So many DVD's today are loaded with trashy promotional featurettes--nothing that really tells about how the movie was made.  "Roger Dodger" does a whole lot better.  The special features are introduced by director Kidd calling it a kind-of film-school-in-a-box.  Interviews abound with all the faculty from Executive Producer to music and sound to casting director and more.  Also included is the trailer, a tip sheet for picking up women (repeated here from the movie), 2 audio commetaries, and a deleted scene with optional commentary.  The one throw-away feature is a guided tour of the New York locations from the movie.  A real good idea for a feature gets wasted here when the hosts (actors from the movie) turn it into 10 minutes of goofing off (and no, it's not funny).  Overall, a 4-star movie, a 5-star DVD.
