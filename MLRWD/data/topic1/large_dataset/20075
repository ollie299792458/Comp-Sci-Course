This movie was AWFUL! The cinematography was terrible. We were looking forward to this for a long time, we sat down to enjoy this as a family, with great anticipation, as we had liked the older Fatima movie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1MXTG">The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima</a>. Don't waste your time or money on the 13th day! The acting, cinematography, etc. are terrible.Tthe other version had a bigger budget I'm sure, but it sadly shows. We hate to give a poor review, and we have nothing against small budget films, as long as they are well done with what they have available, but the guys who made this film tried to show their creativity and it made the movie awful. The angel that's supposed to be a good angel was scary due to the special effects. Our Lady wasn't portrayed as she ought to be, like the other good movies about her apparitions do. The lead actress, who plays Lucia, speaks very fast and like she has a mouth full of marbles or cotton balls or something. A movie to portray such a wonderful story ought to be inspiring, this sadly was not at all.
