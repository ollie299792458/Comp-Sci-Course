I am a huge comic book fan, but I've got limited experience with Hellboy, a character from an independent label.  So I bought the DVD, and watched with an open mind.

First the bad news.  The makeup/costume work on Hellboy himself is not as good as it could have been. For example the makeup for Nightcrawler in X2 (though inaccurate) is more believeable.  Also, some of the acting was a little flat, and I actually would have liked a little more development of the minor characters.

Now the good news--these minor drawbacks weren't enough to take me below 4 stars. Why? First, the main storyline is STRONG. The basic conflict reminds me a bit of "Spawn", in the sense that the story highlights the idea that good and evil aren't always inherent but involve choice.  The special effects were dazzling, and the sets were dark, moody, and believeable.

I almost wish that this was a high-budget TV series instead of a movie. You can tell that there are layers of complexity in the relationships that Hellboy has with his colleagues, and we only get a glimpse of that in the film. Still, the balance between dialogue and action is excellent, and I was more than satisfied with the overall pacing.

Finally, for you fans of Russian history, one of the key bad guys is none other than...Rasputin! Nope, he didn't die after all!

I won't spoil the experience by giving away specific plot elements, but I'd rank Hellboy up there with Blade, X2, and SpiderMan (but behind Spidey 2) for comic book flicks.  If you like a hero with some internal conflict and some flavor, you'll definitely appreciate Hellboy. This movie mixes magic with traditional comic book action, and sprinkles in just enough history to capture your imagination.
