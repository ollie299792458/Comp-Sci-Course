I was extremely surprised when seeing Pirates,I had so much and I just couldn't wait for the Haunted Mansion,after all it had Eddie Murphy and a lot of ghouls from the original attraction.What could go wrong?
Well we all know the answer to that one,it amounts to nothing...
I've never seen Mr murphy playing such a bad role and don't tell me he's a bad actor,the guy is brilliant but it's pretty obvious that the script wasn't.It feels like a kids movie,but even kids won't like this and are used to more funny things then this.
Yes they wanted to keep the fun aspect of the ride....well...where is it?The jokes and punchlines are 3rd rate to non existant.
And what about the ghouls you ask?well that is still the question that is on my mind as well.Oh sure the hitchhiking ghosts are in it,for a split second and I can't blame Rick Baker for making great zombies but how scary do they become with such a bad screenplay,the answer is simple...nowhere.
This is one hell of a missed opportunity,the ingredients for a movie like this are so rich and wonderfull and yet they concoct such an abomination.I've seen Tower of terror(the movie) and even that one has a nicer story element in it.
Sorry guys,go back to the drawing board and ask Roy for some advice...
