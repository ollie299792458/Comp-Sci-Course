I enjoyed the movie! It was a fun and silly plot and I think as far as budget, this type of plot is most interesting when it's low-budget with simple effects. I liked when the Prius exploded because the effects weren't fancy Hollywood; it's quirky.

I think Nick Troy and Samba Schutte were both really funny actors and their performances were great for this film. Samba was HILARIOUS!

I suppose Amazon Test Movies wants viewers to see if the ideas are working, and they ARE! But I don't think this type of genre should be made into a big-budget movie. Hollywood wastes money on special effects and household names, but these actors were a great surprise. And I may add, "Pants," aka Nick Troy seems like the twin of Blake Anderson from "Workaholics." With that in comparison,it's a simple, fun plot that I was really engaged in.

One thing to note: The gangsters were so unbelievable. A rapper has a side-business of pimping, and has cronies who go around to clubs bullying these nerds..... it wasn't a believable plot twist, excluding the mistaken fear that Jessica was a whore - that was funny.
