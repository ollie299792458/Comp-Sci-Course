This is a movie you will find yourself watching over and over. If not, then you would not be able to change the station if you came across it while channel surfing on TV. Each character in this movie is wrought from the mold of a perfect suburbia, with one exception, the new weird neighbors. No one has ever met them, talked to them, or even...took them brownies! Who are these people and why did Ricky Butler say he sees them digging at night in the back yard? Tom Hanks character, Ray is the hero of our story. He's on vacation but when boredom sets in he is bound to unravel the mystery behind these mysterious neighbors. It's practically his duty since he shares a property line with these creepy Klopeks. With his best friend Art at his side and Mark an ex-vet they decide to embark upon an investigation. Watch the hilarity ensue. Are the Klopeks sacrificing people in their back yard? Or Are suburbanites so bored, they will stop at nothing to end their own torture by torturing the "new neighbors"? You'll have to watch to find out. Be prepared, the one-liners just keep coming in this one. You will laugh until your sides hurt and become an undying fan of The Burbs.
