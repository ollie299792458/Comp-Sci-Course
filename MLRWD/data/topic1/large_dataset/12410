This reviewer bought this 'docu-melodrama' based on these reviews, not knowing the prerequisite to enjoy this "masterpiece of American cinema" is to regard Jack Webb's "Dragnet" as perhaps the greatest TV production ever.  The mystery here is why so many reviewers gave this 55-year-old relic a collective 4 stars (one star for each 10 years perhaps?)

Richard Basehart (as Roy Martin, hardly a 30-ish "kid") introduces some dimensionality with acting talents that overcame even this dead-on-arrival script.  In comparison to the others' stone-faced wooden readings, his became the unintended, even sympathetic anti-hero protagonist.  To those pondering this character's motivations, the answer is simple:  Script writers couldn't care less.  To hell with motivation!  We want police action!

Maybe Carol Reed's "The Third Man" borrowed concepts from the sewer chase.  So what?  Does "The Fugitive" - and other such films - owe its' sewer chase to this source too?  "The Third Man" is a textbook example of real five-star cinema, as watching Criterion's re-mastered version back-to-back with this pathetic flick amply demonstrates.  (And revisit the five-star "LA Confidential" while you're at it.)  True, this sewer's noir cinematography is well done.  But the flick is overall a series of caricatures (hardly "promoting respect for police officers...") that are one-dimensional, crime-does-not-pay  parodies (unintended and at times hilarious), with siren-blaring hordes of antique police cars screeching out of garages galore; and corny voice-overs to fill in plot holes and extol the LAPD as wonder-boy saints.

Positives are Basehart's performance (one star); the crisp black and white noir cinematography with few (if any) glitches, and the sound being largely unblemished (one star); a very sweet and clever dog; an OK DVD keep-case; the mercifully short 79 minute running time; and the low DVD cost.  Noir collectors, crime film buffs and film historians may be interested.
