This not a review of the film, its a review of the Blu Ray TRANSFER itself from a non-tech language savvy guy.

If you've ever seen an 80s movie where the scenes take place in a smoke filled bar, then that is exactly what you are gonna be watching in this so called
"Stunning Hi Def 1080p transfer".... Uh....Yeah...Right. Hi Def mosquito noise more like it, but if you like watching mosquito noise in HD, then this is for you.
If you've ever watched the Blu Ray of Predator then you know exactly what I'm talking about.

This is worse.

In my opinon there are no artifacts or "jaggies" like you get watching an upscaled dvd. So its actually above an upscaled 1080i dvd, but below a true 1080p BD.

The colors are flat, they are not bright, but the picture is sharp in the sense that there are no artifacts. Just that never ending cloud of smoke, mosquito noise etc.

You feel like you need to wipe your tv screen down. These movies actually look ten times better on dvd watched on a standard tv (which thankfully I kept)

You have been warned.
