After viewing this film, I cannot understand why so many people gave this film a low rating. I thought it was a perfectly acceptable fun and light-hearted approach to The Lion King. The Lion King scenes that people said The Lion King 1 1/2 desecrated were not desecrated at all. No matter how sensitive the scene was. Of course, the movie cannot be compared to The Lion King...but only total morons would think that the makers of this film planned on making this film so that it would be comparable to The Lion King. It's a parody people - accept that. I agree with other reviewers of this film when they say that the people at Disney were just trying to make some easy cash by releasing this film, but how does that harm us if the movie fulfills its purpose? It does live up to the trailer, at least, and people often view movies depending on their opinion of a movie's trailer. This is not the type of movie which I would watch repeatedly, but it is a good flick to pick if you are a Lion King fan. It also reminds me a lot of the Timon &amp; Pumbaa cartoon series, so if you liked that cartoon series, then you will like this movie. I definitely favor this film over all of the other direct-to-video pre/mid/sequels, including Lion King II: Simba's Pride.
