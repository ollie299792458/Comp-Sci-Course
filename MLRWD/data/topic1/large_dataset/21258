Cold Comfort Farm is a wonderful mixture of offbeat characters and strange situations that make for some of the grandest comedy on screen in some time.  If you think you won't like it because it's an English period comedy  abandon that notion and dive in.  This movie is one you will enjoy. The  actors are perfect for bringing this off and it is a pleasure just to watch  them tangle with this material.  Ian McKellen and Rufus Sewell are  particularly quirky as is Maria Miles as Elphine, but Sheila Burrel as Aunt  Ada gets the best line: "I saw something nasty in the woodshed!"  But the key character is Flora, played to perfection by the delectable Kate  Beckinsale.  It is Flora's good sense and practicality that master the  situation and win the day.  She sets the world right with her refusal to  allow it to be otherwise.  This mix of wacky characters needs the grounding  of Flora to allow us a point of view and Kate Beckinsale establishes that  perfectly.  Ms. Beckinsale has done the kind of exceptional work here that  we've come to expect from her. Get this video and get ready to laugh long  and hard.
