We live in Indonesia where the postal customs place huge "taxes" on anything brought in by post over the value of 50USD...so two grand-nieces were due at our west java home brought in the 12 disc set which had been sent to one of the nieces in Geelong Victoria Australia. The 12 box set had gone from the US to Australia, then with my grand-nieces from australia's gold coast via Kuala Lumpur to Bandung Java........certainly a long way and a long time in getting here.
We all sat and enjoyed Oklahoma...yes I agree with other reviewers the transfer from the 35 mm cinemascope version is superior to that taken from the Todd AO print. We then sat through the Sound of music....and after a week my grand-nieces returned....and I've been enjoying selected songs from the King and I, and South Pacific. Sound and picture's are "superb". The many times I'd gone along to the movies even seeing original 70 mm versions on screen in Australia....the DVD's absolutely "sparkle". I had several "letter-box" R and H musicals and despite the 5:1 sound, this latest compilation even in NTSC looks great on our LCD Samsung.
Unless you move really close to the screen it is hard to determine if the pictures are standard definition. Computer restoration has meant that there's not a hint that the original medium was film.
"Happy Talk" (and her we only have seen some of the songs of South Pacific's road show version) to me is better than ever......computer restorers have excelled themselves in revealing more "shadow" details than the 70 mm print contained.
I could go on and on.....however anyone who has this latest R and H collection will not be sorry.....this is a true collector's item not only for us oldies, but for a whole new generation to enjoy!
