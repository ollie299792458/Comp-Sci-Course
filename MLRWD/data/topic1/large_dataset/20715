This film is getting horrible reviews here at Amazon, and I would like to put up a defensive review of this wonderful movie.
As one reviewer pointed out, I imagine this movie is not for everyone. No movie really is. However, for lovers of the kind of masterful weaving of character and story that Robert Altman is famous for, this movie is truly a gem. Robert Altman has grown to be one of my very favorite directors, and truly an icon of American directors. 
Robert Altman is not concerned with special effects, spine-tingling plot twists, edge-of-your-seat suspence. As is obvious through all of his films, Altman is concerned with character and story. His characters, especially in this film, are deeply rich. While most of them don't pour out thier souls, thier behaviors and particular choices allow you to truly understand each character as a unique patch on a giant quilt. When the movie begins, I began a journey to really know these people, and by the films end I wished that I could stay with each of them a little longer just to watch them live thier funny, and interesting lives.  This film is at once, sad, funny, touching, and fascinating. If you go into the film with an attitude that is prepared to take in an Altman film like Dr. T, this movie will not dissapoint. For those who hated it so passionately, I don't reccomend that you see Altman's other films. However, those who liked what this film did, Altman weaves similar magic in to the characters of Nashville, Short Cuts, Cookie's Fortune, The Player, M*A*S*H, and 3 Women. This film deserves far more credit than its getting, so please, judge for yourself.
