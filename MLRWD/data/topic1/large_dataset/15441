The Bad Seed is one of my all-time favorite movies.  It's creepy, suspensful and unpredictable (unless you read the other reviews on here, then you'll know every single detail of the movie and not ever have seen it).  It leaves a chill running down your spine and stays with you long after you have watched it.  The acting may have been a little too much (and scenes "laughable" and "unbelievable" as other "critics" put it) but we're talking about a movie that was made in the 1950's.  There were no special affects, computer animation and the such back then so producers had to work with what was available.  And in my opinion they did a good job.  I liked how you still got a chill just from the descriptions and dialogue.  There was no need for a scene or blood and gore (unlike today's horror movie where it seems the more blood and guts in the scene = the best horror movie ever.....as unrealistic as they all are).  That's my favorite part of the movie because I'm not a big fan of violence in movies and most of them today turn my stomach when I watch them.  I like movies that leave it up to your imagination without forcing you to watch something you really don't want to see.  I first saw the movie when I was a teenager.  I am now 29 and have seen it numerous times since I first saw it and still enjoy watching it every time.  My husband, who really doesn't like old movies at all, really enjoyed it too (and that's saying a lot for a guy who loves the blood and guts aspect of a horror film).
