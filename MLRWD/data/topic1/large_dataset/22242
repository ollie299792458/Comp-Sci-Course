I just finished the last part a few minutes ago. A week ago or so I started watching the DVD's after teaching myself about limits. Well, he jumped right into derivatives and I was okay with that. He was right where I needed to be taught and during his course he'll give you a lot of tidbits like, "You won't really be using limits." I thought that was pretty funny but relieved somewhat.

Everything he said made the topics easier to understand. I was able to follow through with what he did and he explained every step of the way so I never felt at any point lost or confused.

I'm trying to teach myself Calculus and his video lectures were a good starting point. I'd recommend him to anyone trying to do the same as long as you've got a good textbook and other valuable resources. I'm picking up things fairly quickly, so I'm hoping to get started on his videos on Advanced Calc II within the next few weeks.

He's not boring but he's not going to make you laugh either. The videos were purely meant for learning and demonstration of problem solving techniques. His job is to teach you how to work problems, not theory. I think he made that fairly clear.
