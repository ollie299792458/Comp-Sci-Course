'The Castle' is a charming, inspiring, family-friendly tale about an ordinary bloke who, with the support of his family ('ordinary' too, in terms of education/ social position/ cultural status, but far from ordinary in the unshakable love they have for each other) takes on 'the big guys' - in this case a corporation trying to buy his home for a paltry sum so they can expand the airport cheaply. As is proper for all heartwarming cinematic yarns, the everyman triumphs in the end but not without plenty of laughs - and not a few poignant moments - along the way.

As other reviewers have noted, this version has been re-dubbed for the American market; sometimes the voices are a little less wry than the Australian original, and there are a few moments where they're not quite in sync with the screen (mostly in places where the phrase changes don't add up in terms of syllables: ice-cream 'tub' rather than 'punnet' etc). I also object to the cutting of scenes ('Jenny Jenny?' 'Nah, microwave Jenny' was always one of my favourite lines and it seems to be gone for no good reason, excised in a particularly clunky edit) and the occasionally odd addition of extra or different background music.

Still, I enjoyed being able to show this to my American friends, who enjoyed it very much - perhaps especially so because they required fewer dialect explanations than is normally the case when screening Australian films. (They also enjoyed seeing a young Eric Bana on his native turf, in a supporting role as the kickboxing-mad son-in-law.) Next time I'll bring my disc from home and give them a chance to try out phrases like 'rabbit on' 'tertiary education' and 'servo'. And maybe after that I'll be able to reference Microwave Jenny to my heart's content!
