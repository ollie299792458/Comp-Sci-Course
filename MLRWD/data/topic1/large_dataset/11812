If you love Jews you will love this movie!

Or if you ephatically feel that the Jewish portion of the global WW2 losses is not getting enough world-wide recognition today, particularily by young, uneducated, and disadvantaged Americans, this is the movie for you!

This movie is in large part about a quest to find creative ways to come up with money, credit, and thanks to send to Jewish writers & survivors.

With movies like this, Jews will remain in the forefront of our thoughts.

There seems to be racial themes coming out of hollywood the past decade.

Characters with blond/light hair or light colored eyes;

if male are villanous, violent, morally dispicable, and disgusting.

if female are a cause of various troubles, and in need of help, particularily without knowing their role in it.

And old gray haired men are portrayed as having twisted logic, suggesting the wisdom of our elders should be discarded.

Where is this all going?
