I must say that those who dislike the movie are missing the overall picture of what the movie is saying.  Even though I do believe that children will definitely watch this movie and enjoy it, adults will enjoy it as well.  I first watched this movie when I was younger and loved it.  I watched it again years later and much older and I realized that this movie has a different vibe to it.  I finally understand what the movie was trying to say. Even though this may be labeled a kids movie, the true meaning of the story can only be understood by adults. The moral of the story is to live life to the fullest.  As what Peter Pan usually says, "to live would be an awfully big adventure."  It's about forgetting your childhood and trying to remember who you are.  As people grow up they tend to view life as nothing but work and they lose the innocence of being a kid.  Some people even end up as "pirates." This is what happened to Peter Pan as the point of the movie is to help him remember who he was as his childhood was gone and he grew up too fast. The fact that Peter Pan lived for decades as a boy and grew up way too fast when he decided to leave Neverland shows this.  Decades of being a lost boy was lost. The most touching scene was when he finally remembers.  I believe all people will enjoy this movie.  Don't think too much on the action scenes and how cheesy it is.  Think of the storyline and what the movie is trying to say. It's better than you think.
