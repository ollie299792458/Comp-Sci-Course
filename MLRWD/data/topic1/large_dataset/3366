Let me start off by stating that this review is just concerned with the new release Blu-Ray disc of the Hitchcock classic
"NOTORIOUS". I am being generous with the three stars for the release..two would actually be more accurate, but just for sentimental reasons for such a classic film.
1. I'll be very brief here: Shockingly poor picture quality..I will say that in many medium shots the picture is truly GRAINY..
almost as though this was a VHS transfer..I'm not kidding. It is an absolute CRIME that such a classic received such a shoddy attention..almost as if..the techs who responsible for the transfer hated the movie itself..or at least were not Hitchcock fans and treated this not as a labor of love or sacred duty (as it should have been approached), but like guys who watching a time clock and couldnt wait to leave work!!
2. The movie has an "automatic start up" and you can ONLY access the menu through the "Pop Up" button with the movie playing..
Truly terrible

** NOTE** I know I wrote earlier Three stars; upon writing my review I have def reconsidered that
