I liked Dante's Peak. This is the only 1990s volcano disaster movie that matters. It is well written, directed, and accurate.

The elements of suspense and surprise are maintained through the entire movie. The name of the town is foreboding. One gets the feeling as the movie progresses that the actors are proceeding through various torturous punishments of Dante Alighieri's Inferno. The characters experience real injuries and real human suffering. The shocking first scene drew me in immediately and set the tone for the entire movie.

Dante's Peak is a classic doomsayer-gets-it-right tale. Pierce Brosnan brings just the right personality to that role. While it is true that the USGS might have had sufficient information to sound the alarm even in the 1990s, if a team of USGS-sponsored geeks had alerted the mayor, he would have listened, none of the events in the movie would have taken place, and the movie would be called "The Orderly Evacuation and Rebuilding of Dante's Peak". Bo-ring!

Factual analysis: The portrayal of a volcanic eruption in the Cascades and its effects on the landscape is shockingly realistic. The special effects, pyroclastic eruptions, corrosive sulfuric acid mudflows, tephra and explosive eruptions, are very well done, and most occur in the proper sequence. The only part that required much suspension of disbelief is the scene where the hero's SUV gets stuck in a pahoehoe (Hawaiian, not Cascadian) lava flow and miraculously escapes without even a flat tire. I suppose that was inserted over the protests of the scientific advisers (and common sense) due to the need for "edge of the seat" suspense. This is an action movie, after all.

Overall, I thought the movie was very well made and directed, and I appreciate the fact that the writers insisted on realism over Hollywood spectacle (although in this movie, the realistic parts are spectacular indeed).
