The news from June 25 through September of 2009, was all about Michael Jackson, his death and the surrounding events and the great finale his funeral. Or, so we thought, but the real finale was the film, 'This Is It'.

I have been a fan of Michael Jackson, off and on for the past twenty or so years. In his final years, Michael had happier years with his children or so it seemed, and in death he claimed the fame that was due. We had all heard of the final tour of Michael to start in London. That was never to be, but we do have the the digital video footage of the stage show rehearsals.  It is a remarkable piece of work.  120 hours of footage, showed us the amount of time and toil involved in such a venture. One of Pop Culture's greatest entertainers has been proclaimed a pure creative genius. Kenny Ortega, who was the director of the stage show, put together the final footage that made the film. What we see is a film filled with the wonder of musicians, dancers, performers and members of the stage group in a remarkable film at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Sony paid a unheard of fee for this film, and I imagine they made more than that in spades.

The songs we knew from Michael Jackson are shown in a new reality. At one point, eleven dancers are transferred into eleven million via the green screen project. We see Rita Hayworth singing and the camera turns to Michael Jackson as he dances around Edward Robinson and Humphrey Bogart from one of their old films. 'Thriller' is remade and is remarkable. What we see during all of these remakes in the rehearsals is that Michale Jackson is really the one in charge. He knows his material and what he wants and when he wants it. The performers,dancers, musicians and crew are all n awe of this man. I can imagine the pain these people went through when his death was announced.

This film is a fitting tribute to Michael Jackson.  This Is It. For those of you who are not great fans, take a look and listen- this film is worth the time.

Highly Recommended.  prisrob  01-02-10
