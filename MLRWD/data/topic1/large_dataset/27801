When I first heard about this show, I was steamed. I love the original Kolchak and I was very worried to hear it was getting "reinvisioned". I watched the first episode and my disappointment was justified.

This is NOT Kolchak.

So I pretty much hated it and cheered with many other Kolchak diehards when it was canceled. Then...I happened to catch an episode on the Sci-Fi Channel and, much to my dismay, I didn't think it was half bad. Well, I finally broke down and bought a used copy of the series and, I have to say, I rather like it.

Again, this is NOT Kolchak and, to me, it never will be. If the guy could have just been called Barry Studabacher: The Night Stalker, I would have been much happier. They failed, in my opinion, when they brought on the comparison to the spirit of the old show, which they certainly didn't have. However, judging the new Night Stalker on its own merits, it's actually a pretty good little show. It would have been interesting to see where they would have gone with it.
