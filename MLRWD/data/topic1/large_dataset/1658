Sometimes it frightens me to think of what our future will be, in an age where most households have two parents that have to work and we rely on the village to help us raise them, I take comfort in knowing there is a place like this little town in TN.

They may be "poor" or in a "depressed" economy like the principal stated, but they are rich in the things that count most in this world.

I watched this film for the first time last evening with my 11 year old daughter, the tissue box was never far from hand because the entire story was so moving to us.

There is a young man who was in one of the first group of 8th graders that was at the time of the documentary getting ready for college, he stated that he can't wait for the question to come up in some of his interviews for schools about what's been the most significant event in your life to date, he said this project will be his answer how could it not?

From the survior who told his story of being seperated from his mother and younger brother at the camps only to discover that they had been sent to the cremitorium upon entering, to the vice principals admission that he was guilty of prejudice against not only other races but his students and their value as people,I was heartbroken.

If you can watch this film and not have a life altering experience from it I would be shocked.  I think every school should host a talk with survivors because as one of them pointed out the only way people will know about it after they are gone is by what they've read in books.

I've read books, I've read the Diary of Anne Frank for school myself, but nothing compares to hearing their accounts first hand, in print you can imagine it as fiction because you mind doesn't want to imagine such things could be true, in person you can't deny the power of their spirts and the events that shaped their lives.

If you could only view one documentary in your lifetime I think it should be this one.
