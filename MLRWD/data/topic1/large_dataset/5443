This is a great movie, I love it, I want to show it to all my friends!  I just wish there was a little more "meat" to it.  I've always felt they stopped about halfway or 3/4s of the way through the process of getting hard facts and data into the documentary.  There's a lot of great information, but from the title, I was expecting more of an expos&eacute; on the specifics of the "birth industry" in America than this is.  I like the way the documentary ended, so it didn't wander into "All medical interventions are bad and just a grab for your money!" territory, I thought it really balanced out the whole thing.

The personal stories are wonderful (though I wish we had spent more time with the midwifery practice to personalize that story more), the information is fascinating, the births are amazing, and it's all packaged beautifully.  Again, the only complaint is that I would have liked -more- specifics on insurance company profiteering, policy trends that care more about protecting against liability than making sure the woman is really cared for, and things of that nature (the Business end of "The Business of being born").  Usually I would object to some of the language that is occasionally involved that is not edited out and could have been, but I've been at births, I know how it can be when you're right in the hea(r)t of it and I think it's not wrong to show it.  It's a good movie I just think more could have been done.
