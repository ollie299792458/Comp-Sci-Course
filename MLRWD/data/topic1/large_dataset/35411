Mr. Uyeshima's review provides a wonderful and accurate description of this film. I have little to add, but do recommend Then She Found Me, if the viewer understands that this is not a mainstream Hollywood romance. Those seeking yet another reprisal of a Colin Firth as Darcy to a modern day Elizabeth Bennett treatment probably will be disappointed. The film has many layers, with a primary focus on betrayal, not just formulaic romantic love. I read some complaints that reviewers didn't find the characters likable and found Ms. Hunt not glamorous enough. One of the things I enjoyed most was more realistic, complex portrayal of human foibles than we're often given in film today. I laughed when I read the comments about Ms. Hunt's appearance, because this basically is what you look like when it all comes crashing down around you. You can relate to these characters. They are quite imperfectly human.

I like it. This is a film for adults, which is a such rarity these days. There is a lot of heart to the story and its characters. Lots of lovely subtleties in scenery, music, costuming, etc. The cast is superb, comedy is generally smartly written and well delivered. Formulaic aspects to some story lines, but it was thought-provoking overall, and well worth viewing.

I'm a fan of Helen Hunt as an actress and am proud to see such a strong directorial debut. I hope she continues. I really recommend checking out the Special Features section of the DVD, especially the interviews and featurette. Those interested in film making will enjoy Ms. Hunt's commentary, much of which focuses on the creative detail of telling the story, especially with little budget and limited time.

I think this film deserved more of a chance than it got. It's not a "chick flick," fluffy romance or Lifetime movie. It's an adult comedy-drama with a thought-provoking theme and wonderful performances. Not a perfect film, by any means, but better in its genre than I've seen in awhile.
