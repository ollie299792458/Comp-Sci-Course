Quentin Dupieux's movie is supposedly about a tire that comes to life and kills using its mind. While this would appear to be the main plot, it ignores the fact that there are 3 stories happening at once.

the first being the the tire bit. The other 2 parts revolve around the stories of the audience and the actors. this not literal as these 2 groups are actually movie characters but there is the idea that there is a film taking place and there is an audience to see the film. they are aware and the actors are aware of the events being a film but the other characters are not. for them this is real life.

The idea of no reason is the idea of this movie and it is adressed in many ways. A lot of reviews for this movie complain about the pacing and nonsensical story as well as the stupidity/gimmick of a movie about a tire. The point that is largely missed is that it is a critique and satire of the movie experience and goes back and forth as to the reality for the characters. while the movies plot was made for no reason the audience's interpretations are what makes the film have value. It asks the audience to analyze what it is doing and rather than focusing on a silly plot, it shows another side to the movies that the typical viewer doesn't think about.

Rubber is a nice mesh of surreal and absurd abstractions of ideas. Its not for everybody and isn't a movie you want to watch if you just want to veg out. If you go into this movie thinking it is just a typical B-movie with some lols and over the top action about a tire that comes to life and kills everything..... your going to be disappointed. Go into this movie in the right mind set and it actually is pretty good.
