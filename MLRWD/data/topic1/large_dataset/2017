I loved this movie. It was funny. The Wayans always make me laugh.  Their comedy is not for people who are sensitive to jokes about people's racial feelings.  I read some of the reviews for this film and found them to be truly stupid.  People are saying that the film is racist.  Well if you look at the history of theatre you'll find that it was racist long before the Wayans Brothers came along.  What about white actors in Black face.  Why do you think Black people went crazy when Ted Danson did that Black face bit.  How many white people have you seen play Native Americans in Westerns and why is it in every Western the Native Americans are depicted as wrong when the bottom line is Europeans came over here and took over a land they had no right to.  So before you start screaming racism when a Black person makes a film poking fun at racial feelings you need to look back and see the blood on the hands of theatrical and film productions done by white people.  Also remember that at one point Black people couldn't even get in theatres unless they were the cleaning crew.  This film was funny for what it was depicting and the people who starred in and produced the movie were excellent for what the plot and purpose of this movie was about.
