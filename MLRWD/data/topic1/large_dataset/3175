This Is It movie is a Must See!!! The best documentary this year bar none. It's inspiring, riveting , bittersweet and funny. Watching this movie brought tears to my eyes, made me smile, made me dance, made me sing, he rocked it all over again! MJ looked happy, healthy and exuberant. The scenery and dance moves were fantastic .Inspiring creative genius throughout the entire film. Sometimes you forget Michael is dead, because he's so alive in "This Is It." Other times, you're struck with a profound sadness when you remember that what is on screen really is the last piece of history from an artist who truly cared about his craft and excelled at executing it. And that we'll never see him again

Michael was astute, polite, compassionate ,a great leader and teacher  both as a performer and as a human being. The world lost a genius and great humanitarian. I am saddened by this great loss. I felt like I was at a concert and He was just rehearsing. Everybody at the theater were dancing and clapping after each song.  What a great concert this would have been? I did not want the movie to end. The energy of the concert stuck with me well after watching it .  I loved every minute and I am going to see it several more times. I cannot wait for the DVD.  MJ was really all about L.O.V.E. Run to see it!!!!!!
