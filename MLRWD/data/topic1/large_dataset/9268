Like the Brian DePalma remake, Howard Hawks' original 1932 "Scarface" is a comedy with bullets telling the tale of the rise and fall of one Tony Camonte, an apish thug whose motto is: "Do it first, do it yourself, and keep on doing it." As he effortlessly rises to the top, climbing over such lesser lights as the cowardly Lovo played by Osgood Perkins--Anthony's father and a renowned stage actort in his day--and the hot-headed Gaffney--Boris Karloff, accent and all--he accidentally or purposely loses his friends, the coin-flipping Guino Rinaldo (George Raft in his star-making role), the bumbling Angelo (Vince Barnett), the icy-hot blonde Poppy (Karen Morley) and the sister he not-so-secretly lusts after (Ann Dvorak). When all are gone and he stands alone, he's an actor without an audience and the show is over.
Don't bother trying to decide which version is better--both are execllent genre entries in their own way. But be aware that Hawks' film caused as much outrage in 1932 as DePalma's version did a half-century later--and for good reason.
