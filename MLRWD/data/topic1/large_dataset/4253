I'm not a ballet dancer; I have never had a day of ballet instruction in my life, so you don't need any history in dance to do this workout.  I bought this because I found yoga challenging, yet very boring.  I love running, aerobics, and rock climbing.  I have completed marathons in the past and I consider myself in good physical condition; I enjoy pushing myself through challenging endurance workouts.  This definitely fits the bill.  Tracey Mallett pushed me to my limits, but I felt very good (rather than destroyed) at the end of the workout.  Good total body routine.  It's hard to pick out the "good" barre workouts from the mediocre or too easy, since this is apparently the new fitness trend.  However, this one definitely ranks among the best.  I expect to use this DVD several times per week for strength training (this workout will have your heart rate elevated and the sweat pouring, so it does not skimp on cardio--I'm just more of a cardio purist, so I'll still hit the treadmill every other day or so).

A few reviewers have complained about Tracey's voice or cheerleader-like attitude.  I have no issue with her voice at all; she has an accent (Australian?) and she will encourage you to "shake your booty" or "work your booty," but certainly not in any offensive of phony way.  In my opinion, anyone who dislikes this workout on the basis of her voice alone is making excuses to avoid pushing themselves through this challenging workout.
