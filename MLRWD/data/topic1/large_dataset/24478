In scientific terms, the Event Horizon is the precipice of a black hole, the point of no return before one is hurled into the endless unknown.  How appropriate for this Sci-Fi set gothic Horror.  I loved this twist on the  derilict spaceship plotline.  At the beginning of the movie it feels like  another Star Trek - Battlestar Galactica-esque movie; you are in deep space  searching for a lost ship and then when you find it there are no life  signs. The movie stays calm for exactly 15 minutes.. then all Hell breaks  loose, literally. I have seen such darkness come from H.R. Geiger as and  artist, and Clive Barker as a writer so you will understand my shock when I  found neither name attached to the film. With a feel like "Hellraiser" and  nonstop action like - well, anything with Bruce Willis - "Event Horizon"  grabbed my attention from the first pulse-pounding chord of it's soundtrack  to the very last (?) scream.  I enjoyed seeing the dark transition of Dr.  Weir from a seemingly normal scientist to an individual so obsessed that he  becomes the darkness we all fear.  Sam Neill has shown a tremendous expanse  of acting through the past several years, from a Palentologist in "Jurassic  Park" to the fantastic "Merlin" even as far back as "Dead Calm" he has  unerringly played the good guy, it's a delicious twist to have him cast as  the antagonist in Paul Anderson's horrifying tale.  The one hard point in  the movie is the decision one must make as a viewer, can you really hate  this man?  From the beginning of the movie we share his pain and loss, we  share his desire and then are challenged to share his mania a truly unique  psychological horror. I must give this a perfect "10" as this movie shows  no signs of a "cheese factor," no overacting, nothing overdone and  everything played and built to perfection.  This is where reality and  fantasy meet to push the envelope within the mind.
