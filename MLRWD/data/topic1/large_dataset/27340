I missed this one at the theater, but bought it on DVD. Sound is excellent. The Steel Dragon tunes are awesome and in my opinion make the movie work. Stephen Herek and crew did a great job putting together Jason Bonham, Jeff Pilson, and Zakk Wylde on percussion, bass, and guitar (respectively) along with vocalists Jeff Scott Soto and Mike Matijevik to form an actual band. STEEL DRAGON would make a great 80s style rock band and these talented musicians make the songs work. I have already ordered the soundtrack. If you enjoyed the "larger than life" concert productions of 80s style bands with melodic and driving tunes, you will enjoy the movie and soundtrack of Rock Star. 
  Oh yea, Mark Wahlberg does a fine job along with the other actors holding down the plot of the movie which showcases humor and melodrama mixed with the wild "lifestyle" of many major rock bands. Still, the music makes the movie and the concert scenes are the most powerful. I give it five stars for the music.
