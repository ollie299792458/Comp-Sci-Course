Vampires are everywhere. It seems at least 3-4 vampire movies come out a year(thanks to crappy Twilight)and most suck. Take for instance The Vampire's Assistant, it was awful. Hollywood is treating vampire movies as after school specials in light of Twilight's sucksess. However, Daybreakers shows some potential but still falls a little short.

Set in a post viral outbreak world in 2019, Edward (Hawke) plays a reluctant vampire who is a hematologist at a blood farming factory. He is hoping to find a synthetic substitute for blood in an effort to solve the shortage crisis and stop the hunting of humans. In a fateful car accident, he runs into a band of humans who may have found a cure. Edward soon finds himself caught up in corporate lies, military  operations and betrayal. The fate of the human race is in his hands.

Sounds pretty good, right? The problem, is that it is only 90 minutes long. Character development is thrown at you like bullets from a military vampire's machine gun. Yet, this a much better vampire movie effort and deserves some praise. 30 DAYS OF NIGHT is still one of the best modern vampire movies to date, I recommend it to anyone who is sick of teenie-bopper like vampire films.

NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: An excellent disc. The film is very dark, and that is where the power of blu ray lies. Images are sharp and clear even in pitch blackness. Wonderful sound and decent special features. FINAL THOUGHTS: A must own for fans.
