I consider myself an educated film buff. I seek out the how, when, who, why, of each film. The social, global climate at the time, and political power over film maker's. Which is just as much a character of a film.

This is a film with stories that mirror people, values, institutions and a period in global history.

The author, Sinclair Lewis, was one of the best novelists to date, recognized as a "gem" one of many that disturbed wealthy mover's and shaker's, industrialists, political lobby's, and "black marketeer's".
His authenticity, uncommon perspectives, and immunity to mass appeal and $$ are evident as he takes on subject matter that doesn't distract, but rather disturbs.

William Wyler's film honored the original story, it is universal and timeless. While pleasing the viewer with period icons, scenery, styles.

Thank you to IMBD and Amazon for giving me a collection of "masterpiece's",  without the combined help I wouldn't have these obscure "gems" .
