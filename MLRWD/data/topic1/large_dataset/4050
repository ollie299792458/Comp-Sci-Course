I read the other reviews before purchasing this movie; even though the consensus seemed to be that it was just a vehicle for Mr. Shatner's ego, I had to have it, being a many-decades-long fan of Star Trek.

His interviews were insightful, astonishingly honest, intelligent, and humorous.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!

Does Mr. Shatner have a "big ego"?  Perhaps.  But how could he not?  How could any one of us not have a big ego, if walking in his shoes?  The scenes from the Star Trek conventions, where he walks nonchalantly through the halls with people gasping and exclaiming in delight and, yes, awe, are very telling.  People were genuinely thrilled to see him and/or talk to him.

Sure, you might say that any Hollywood celebrity experiences this kind of adulation.  But what living celebrity created a universe of entertainment spanning 45 years, all based around his original depiction of a character?

I say if any entertainer is justified in having whatever amount of ego he has, it's William Shatner...
