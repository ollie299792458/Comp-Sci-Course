An ex car theif makes a "come-back tour" to save his little brother who got himself in over his head.

Besides the fact that it features Nicholas Cage, and Robert Duvall among other big names, I liked the story a lot. The actors work together beautifully in this movie and the result, I think is like MAGIC. If I had to name a part that I didn't like, well, that would hard. The part where Memphis is driving "Eleanor" was a little drawn out (in my opinion) but it was very relevant to the story, and action loving people who have a thing for cars, I'm sure will love it.

 I loved the role that Nicholas Cage played in this, he comes across as very masculine and fearless, and brave but very loving of his family, as he does what needs to be done -while being well aware of the dangers involved. In a situation (business) that requires quick reflexes and action, he knows when to be slow and calculating and I loved the scene where he stops and it seems listens to his 'intuition' (by remembering a small detail) and backs away from a trap. The writer's/producers of this really did a superb job with this!

This movie is on my top 10 of ones I love and could watch over and again.
