At long last, The Andy Griffith Show is finally getting its due. I received Season One for Christmas, and it was (and still is) beautiful. The picture is as sharp as 'ol Andy's mind. It was a dream come true, in a manner of speaking, to finally see the greatest show of all time get the treatment it has deserved since DVDs were invented. And now we're being treated with another slice of sweet, heavenly Mayberry pie. Now, after this, we should have six more luscious servings to go. And the funny thing is, I'll never get stuffed.

But the only bad thing about these sets so far is the lack of extra archival bonus features. To me, stuff like that is fascinating to watch. And also some new documentaries would be wonderful as well. Not to mention commentaries by some of the original cast members like Andy Griffith, Ron Howard, Don Knotts & others, and the series' writers, as well as writers/historians like Neal Brower, Ken Beck, Jim Clark, Joey Fann and Richard Kelly. That would be incredible. And what I think would be interesting would be a documentary on all of the writers of the show (Aaron Ruben, Jim Fritzell, Everett Greenbaum, Harvey Bullock, etc.)

But, all in all, this is the most minor (albeit a bit lengthy) of complaints which will not stop me from going out and getting this the day it is released. Keep 'em comin', guys!

And lots of luck to you and yours.
