I'm not a big fan of Britney Spears and I've never been much impressed by her singing. Recently, I've almost felt sorry for her the way she's been dumped upon from a lot of quarters of late, including in criticisms of this movie. She seemed one of the main ones provoking a "singers shouldn't try to act" attitude of late. In light of all that, her performance in this was a pleasant surprise. Acting didn't seem to put her out of her league at all, in fact I believe her performance is what carried this movie. CROSSROADS is no major classic. It is a minor feel-good movie that thrives on stock characters - a circle of friends remaining true to each other, stock surprise heroes, and stock lousy parents and lovers. Just maybe minor new twists, like a mother who abandonded her child while the father strives to be the good parent, where stock characterizations would more likely have had the situation reversed. Not a lot of gray area or tremendous depth of characters, but on the whole this is a minor feel-good romp, not a waste of a night at the movies. And I believe its success owes in big part to Britney's surprise moving performance.
