Possibly the best season in the entire series, Season 3 is an amazing tale of what the strike team is willing to do to keep their Money Train problems under wraps. Season 3 is really the one season in the series that defines who the characters really are, that's what really makes this season work.

First off, Shane's character really shows his true colors in this season. His major conflict with Tavon shows what many suspected in the first few seasons, and much more. Lem's character in the show is really developed when he decides to take drastic measures to get rid of the Strike Team's problems, while Vic is just trying to keep his team together and his life on track. Meanwhile, Dutch slowly begins to suspect the Strike Team had something to do with the Money Train.

The story really ties up some loose ends that I've wanted to figure out since the end of season 1. This makes the story very interesting throughout the entire season. The Money Train issues are finally resolved and the stike team begins to fall apart. Also, Michael Chiklis makes an amazing directorial debut in the episode Slipknot.

A very excellent season.
