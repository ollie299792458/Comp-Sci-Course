When I purchased this Blu-ray I did extensive searches on review trying to figure out what type of glasses they used for the movie and nobody talked about them. When you look at the outside of the case they show cardboard glasses with what looks like they grey style lenses you get at the movie theater. So I was interested to see if our glasses we kept from the theater would work. Upon getting the movie last night and opening the case i was very disappointed to see that they were using green and pink lenses instead of the grey lenses they showed on the cover. We watched the first 10 minutes of the movie because they said they it could take up to 5 minutes to get use to watching the movie with the glasses. As soon as the movie starts Coraline looked like her hair was green for the whole time we watched in 3D even though when i took of my glasses i could see that her hair was blue. When we switched to the 2D version and got through the opening credits we noticed that they were showing a whole different scene then where the 3D version starts. In the 3D version it starts with Coraline looking out the window at the rain and getting a package from Wybie. But in the 2D version you see them unpack the truck and Coraline go up the hill to the hidden well where she meets Wybie for the first time.

I give the Blu-ray a 3 star rating only because the 3D was so bad and they left out a very important part of the movie in the beginning. Other then that the 2D version gets a 5 from me. I loved the story line.
