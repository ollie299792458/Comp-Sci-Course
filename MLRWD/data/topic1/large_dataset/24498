The most recent DVD release from MGM/20th Century Fox of The Fabulous Baker Boys, in spite of indifferent sound, is still a wonderful viewing experience.  Thanks to the latest copy protected but still crisp video transfer, the glorious photography of Michael Ballhaus is well served showing Jeff and Beau Bridges, Michelle Pfeiffer and the mostly cold wet city of Seattle in spot on performances.  Released to the big screen in 1989, The Fabulous Baker Boys, (performed by the real brothers Bridges,) is a timeless journey into the mysteries and intrigues of a fifteen year- two piano - lounge act made fresh again by the addition of an engaging and beautiful singer, (suprisingly underplayed by Ms Pfeiffer.)  While most of the keyboard music in the film is provided by the great Dave Grusin, Ms Pfeiffer more than adequately holds her own both as actor and singer.  And yes her wonderfully choreographed scene atop a piano of "Makin' Whoopee" is in a class by itself.  So here is a bare bones and economically priced DVD release of a film which begs for a deluxe makeover but for the moment still shines handsomely in spite of its sub run treatment.  Enjoy.
