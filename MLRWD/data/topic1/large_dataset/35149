While I really liked the original Wii Active, I found I had to take frequent lengthy breaks from it because it really abused my knees and thighs.  I'm 31 and a fairly fit person who only has 15 pounds I want to lose, so I didn't think it should have been so hard on me!  With this version, though, there appears to be a lot more variety and the new format better disperses the exercises so that I can actually still walk when I am done :)  I used to get excited for the arm exercises in the old game just so I could get my breath--while the abdominal moves really work you hard, I feel it gives further break to the other areas in my body.  In fact, I've been so excited by this I've been doing the 6 week challenge every day in a row so far (difficult level) rather than taking the prescribed breaks!  For me, I also feel like this version is better responsive in regard to the controllers.  I've had fewer hang-ups, and most of them I blame on using a stronger exercise band that doesn't "flex" as well as the included band.  Of course, I did take a lot of time working out my frustrations with the controllers on the last game, so I may be one step ahead of new users!  I also feel like a lot of the cues given by the instructor are more effective in correcting problems.  This version took about 95% of what I thought was less-than-ideal in the old version and made it substantially better in my opinion.  I really prefer the tropical resort setting of this game too, silly as it sounds!  I'm really excited by this new game and I feel bad that my Wii Fit is now gathering dust...I strongly recommend this game if you're trying to make something good happen for you on your Wii!
