Enough people have labored here about how good these shorts are, so i won't add to that.  However, before you purchase, please be sure you get the CORRECTED discs from Disney.  Read on...

Back in the 1950's, Walk Disney had many of the earlier Silly Symphonies title cards replaced with cheesy ones featuring a big Mickey Mouse head. He did this because the early Disney shorts were distributed through other studios. Now that he owned all the distribution rights, he didn't want any other studio name to be seen on his films (Columbia, RKO, etc).  In case you didn't know, a title card is the first thing that pops up in the short.  It announces the title, the credits, production year, etc.  The 1950's replacements were pretty plain.  Many purists, myself included, prefer to see the original title cards, to put them in an historical context.  They also make the opening of the short different, as the correct ones set you up for what you are about to see.  It's kinda weird seeing a big Mickey Mouse head drawn in the 1950's, followed by a cartoon with 1928 animation.

Anyway, when this set was first released, Disney announced that it had corrected all the 1950's-era title cards, and given every short their original title card, as when each short was first released.  This didn't quite happen.  After many fans complained, Disney fixed the problem, restoring all the original title cards....but only through replacement discs.  They did not correct the ones already packaged.  So, if you DO want the corrected discs, you must contact Disney, and they will replace them for free.

In the end, it might not be something that many will care about, but i noticed it, and it's so much more fun to watch these as they are supposed to be viewed.  The 1950's changes aren't quite as bad as Greedo shooting first, but i like to see films as they were originally created.
