WATCH THIS MOVIE! This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time...
My cousin and I decided to challenge our boredom and watch a movie the other day. I left my house with high hopes of ridding myself of redundancy but never expected that one movie could change my whole perception of an all-too-corrupt world. The title of this brilliant artwork is Pay it Forward. Although it features a list of talented actors who without-a-doubt add to the movie's success, the poise of this movie lies in the plot. A quick summary would never be enough to pay tribute to the movie's excellence, but carries out the message nonetheless.
A local social studies teacher, Mr. Simonet, seems to have his life in perfect order. This perfection, his facade, is put to the test when he assigns his class a project: to think of one way to better our world. One of his students, Trevor, takes the assignment seriously and comes up with a beautifully sorted utopian idea. He presents his idea to the class and the teacher is impressed but not convinced of it's effectiveness. Pay it Forward is easy to understand. When someone does something for you that you could not achieve yourself, you must do something good for three other people. Then it's their turn to "pay it forward." 
I think the message in this movie was beyond motivational. What I love most about this movie is that Trevor's idea is possible to achieve. This practice could start off as a mere chain but can eventually turn into an unconscious good-for-all event. People might even start doing good deeds because it comes from the heart, rather than to complete "their part of the deal" like the original concept of Pay it Forward implies. Overall, the movie is realistic and the concept is admirable. We can only hope that this movie's script will be acted out in our everyday lives.
