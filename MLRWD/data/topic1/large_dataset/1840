I dig Buffy and to a lesser extent I enjoy an occasional mindless  action flick, so I expected this Asian vampire slayer dvd would be satisfying on some level. Nope.

The film starts out as if it were trying to be set in the real world, where an agency of solitary blade-wielding heroes are dealing with the vampire problem. But after that set up the story becomes more farcical, with one of these heroes' sisters trying to date a young vampire (who covers himself in the equivalent of shoe polish to go on a date in the daytime). None of this farce raises itself to the level of actually being funny, it just leaves you scratching your head saying "what sort of film is this, where we're supposed to believe the sister of a vampire hunter doesn't think it might be iffy to date a vampire?"

And by the way, some may expect vampire films to be sexy. Some may expect Asian action films to be sexy. The vampire effect is both a vampire film and an Asian action film, and it has no sex appeal whatsoever. It is rated R, but aside from the bloody opening scene the film is G. This film is a mess of different styles, as if different directors gave up on it.

There's a random scene in the middle where Jackie Chan is trying to get married but his fiance is drunk (oh the hilarity), which seems like it might have been leftover footage from an entirely different film. But no, it was made just for this one. We know this because Chan turns up again later that evening, inexplicably working the late shift at a hospital (don't they have honeymoons in Asia?).

Don't bother.
