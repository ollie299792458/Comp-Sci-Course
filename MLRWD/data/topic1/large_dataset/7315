THE PARTY is a movie whose title gives away the plot.  Ooops!  Should I have said "spoiler warning" before I wrote that?

The fact is, this movie is a showcase for Peter Seller's comedic talents.  Just as in the PINK PANTHER movies, he plays a fish out of water (here an Indian rather than a Frenchman).  There's a bit of a dramatic arc to the movie, which is why this isn't just sketch comedy, but the real point is to see how funny improvised pantomime can be.  Yes, a few minutes could have been edited out of the ending where the slapstick level rises dramatically, but that was the style back then.

Reasons to watch this film:

a) To see a 3-wheeled Morgan.

b) To see how Sellers be amazing funny without pulling faces (a la Jim Carrey) or even dialogue.  Seller's character is a real person and not an over-the-top characterization.  This is the type of film that Charlie Chaplin could have made 50 years prior to it's release.

c) To see a stylized version of 60's fashion.  Blake would shoot another extended party sequence 10 years later in SOB (1981) and it's interesting to compare the passage of time via fashion and social behavior.

d) To learn comedic timing from one of the masters:  Peter Sellers.  This movie would simply not be possible without him in it.  Watch and see how much humor he can derive from such simple actions as retrieving a shoe, flushing a toilet, or finding a men's room.  This is the reason why you can have surprisingly long takes (and in master shots no less!):  Sellers knowns how to pace the timing and doesn't need the film editors to do so.

e) To see Gavin MacLeod before he became a TV star on Mary Tyler Moore and the Love Boat.  (And he plays a nasty guy here!)

f) To remind yourself that sometimes very subtle gestures can be the most funny.

This movie plays like an old-time silent film and you might be inspired to look at the works of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, or Harold Lloyd if you like this movie.
