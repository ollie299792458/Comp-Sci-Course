Years back we had "Love Story," with Ali McGraw. Anyone remember that movie? A beautiful rich guy in love with a beautiful woman who dies beautifully, rather than live happily ever after. "The Fountain" is another clever film that takes some ideas,  myths, and cliches mainly about death, mixes them  up, then uses sophisticated imagry to create a film without much of a plot, just two beautiful people in love and dying, thru the ages this time..... but oh, does this film look good! And you can argue endlessly about the story, the symbolism, and its "meaning."

The macro photography creates elegant eye candy that conjures up a convincing trip thru a nebula. Kudus to the film's producers, who used limited funds creatively, rather than skimp on fancy computer imagry limited by human capabilities. For my money, the space trip bests Kubrick's famous space "trip" sequence in the movie, "2001: A Space Odyssey," and Hugh Jackman looks great with and without hair, as conquistador, scientist, and budha, and you can play with the ideas and interpret the film in many ways. The title has only a vague and tenuous relationship to the story, to make of what you will.

If you are looking for a film maker buring with a message to convey, go see a documentary. This film is like a piece of clay. You can have your fun pulling a lot of philosophical ideas out of it.
