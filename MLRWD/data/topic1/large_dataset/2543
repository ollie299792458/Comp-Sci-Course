Imagine the entire world covered with water, save for a small area called "dry land" by the handfull of survivors, a patch of land that none of the survivors have ever seen.  So the basic plot of the movie is the search for this mythical "dry land".
Where does the poetic license come in?  Most of it is in the form of the bad guys, called "smokers", led by Dennis Hopper.  The "smokers" get their name because they smoke cigarettes.  So...where does the tobacco come from?  Naturally there is no explanation, plausable or otherwise.  The "smokers" ride the waves on (of all things) jet skis!  Where do they get their gasoline?  Hmmm, well, obviously not at the local gas station, which is now several hundred feet below the surface.  In one of the early attack scenes the "smokers" have what appears to be a twin .50 caliber armor piercing machine guns.  Any guesses as to where the amunition comes from?  Didn't think so.  Later in the movie the "smokers" are seen flying a Piper Cub or some such small aircraft.  The world's only Air Force, flying on the same mythical fuel that powers the jet skis.  Finally we learn that the "smokers" live on (ready for this?) the Exxon Valdez!!  And of course Capt. Joe Hazlewood is the patron saint of the "smokers".  Whoever thought that one up must surely be a top executive by now.  
There are others things that just don't make any sense in a world covered by water, they are rather easy to spot.  But don't let my sarcasm about the smokers fool you.  In SPITE of all of these things, "Waterworld" is an entertaining movie that is fun to watch.
