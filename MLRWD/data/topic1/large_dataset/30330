This movie is way funny. More funny than any of John Hughes films. Let me tell you this movie will keep you smiling cause this movie is laughable. Lane's obsession with his old girlfriend Beth drove him to attempt suicide numerous of times in humorous ways cause he thinks he has no future with a woman. His mom cooks sea creatures and other weird creatures for dinner. He gets a job at the burger-joint but his boss doesn't like him that much. He goes to the school dance and finds the beautiful french girl there who finds him very attractive and appreciates his well-being. So Lane should be a lucky guy to have her. So he should get over with Beth and just focus on someone who is more loyal to him than she.
Oh and don't forget the lovely Elizabeth Daily who sung at the school dance with a lovely voice. She's one heck of a singer that I totally admire for her talent. How could anyone forget her?! Well, she should never be forgotten cause she's my idol!

Better Off Dead is a movie never to be missed cause this movie is worth seeing and a true teen comedy classic at best. And I do hope it comes on blu-ray real soon cause it'll look alot better on that disc than on dvd barnone.
