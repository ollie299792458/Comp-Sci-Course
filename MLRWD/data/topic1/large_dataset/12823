Children of the Living Dead is an awful, low budget zombie film that is about, well, the living dead.  It opens with a zombie plague being crushed completely by humans.  However, one zombie escapes destruction and (after the film jumps ahead in time) ends up causing the demise of some snotty teens.  The film then commits the cardinal sin of cinema of jumping ahead YET AGAIN in time and now we're treated to a car dealer wanting to build his car lot on top of a graveyard.  Because the lone zombie is more of a vengeful ghost/killer than an instinct-driven flesh-eater from Dawn of the Dead, he starts reanimating more bodies to stop this.  This film is extremely dull, has AWFUL "acting", and an extremely small budget which shows painfully throughout the movie.  (I'd guess only a film shot by a teen armed with a camcorder in his backyard could have any lower of a budget.)  One can only guess why Tom Savini decided to be in this dog of a film. 
Pass on Children of the Living Dead.  You won't be sorry you did.
