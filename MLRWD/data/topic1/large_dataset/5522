As A Fellow Amazon.com Reviewer Told Me, "Always be Honest and Speak Your Mind." And That's What I'll Do.
  Remember the Titans is the true story of a small town in Virginia during the 1970's. The "white" high school and the colored "Black" high school are forced to combine into one school, the T.C Williams High School. From then on, everything turns to trouble, there are rallies, fires and fights. But just as the current football coach Yoast is about to enter the Virginian high school football hall of fame, he is replacded by his job by the new head coach, Coach Boone (amazingly acted by Denzel Washington), an experienced African- American Football Coach, from North Carolina. He asked Coash Yoast, to be assistant head coach when the two high schools combine. On top of this being between the two coaches, they both have to figure out how to bring the two teams into one team, the Titans and try to end the prejudice between the white and the colored players. Despite of the above description, the movie does a great job balancing itself so that it is dramatic and you are able to understand what racism was like during that time period, but there is plenty of humor to cause you not to be upset during the entire film. This Movie is Defintly a Must Buy, becuase I have seen this movie numerous times, and never get tired of its humor, drama and prejiduce. This movie has made me laugh, cry, and made me very much wiser about the world. I suggest buying it, but if you are always like me you always have to see it first. But I Can almost guarantee that you will absolutely love and enjoy this film. The Soundtrack, is also worth checking out, which features the hit "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Tarell. It really is fantastic.  Thanks for Reading,  Jordan
