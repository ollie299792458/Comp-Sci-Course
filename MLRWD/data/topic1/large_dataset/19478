I don't have HBO or anything premium, so I can't say for sure if this is the best comedy on television.  But without question it's the best network comedy and in the top three in network shows.

A lot of The Office UK purists trash the US version and I don't think that's fair.  First of all, I don't think they've watched enough episodes to pass judgment.  Second, even if they had watched several, I doubt they'll give it a fair chance.  I personally think Ricky Gervais is hilarious and I liked the UK version.  Unfortunately, the fact that this is a remake of a beloved show in the UK will make it instantly unappealing in many eyes.  But let's remember that Gervais has his blessing on this show as an executive producer.

As far as the third season goes, it's superb.  The Michael and Jan storyline progresses quite a bit, much more so than the Pam-and-Jim saga.  The passive-aggressive Ryan character gets some further development.  The addition of Ed Helms as goofball Andy Bernard, like him or hate him, adds another dimension of humor to the ridiculously talented cast.  Rashida Jones plays it effectively straight as Karen.

In all, this is another great chapter in The Office series.  I have to say Season Two is still my favorite.  But Season Three does not disappoint.
