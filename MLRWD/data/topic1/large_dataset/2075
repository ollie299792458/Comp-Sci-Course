I went in the theatre with high hopes. I watched it. And I left feeling satisfied. This is a great movie, but that isn't to say that it is without its flaws.
First off, this movie is way too similar to the previous movie by Dark Castle Entertainment, House on Haunted Hill. Here are a few examples.
- Both have a slightly (initially) crazed, pessimistic, comic-relief character
who knows the ropes around the house. This was Watson Pritchett in House on
Haunted Hill, and Dennis Rafkin in 13 Ghosts.
- Both have basements. In both versions, when the main characters first go
into the basement, they get a shock. Both have henchmen of the crazy
millionaire who die in the basement (the mantainence guy in House on Haunted
Hill, and the lawyer guy in 13 Ghosts.
- Both start off with music playing as we follow the main characters initial
arrival at the house. (While House on Haunted Hill had a very cool, very
memorable scene with Marilyn Manson's rendition of 'Sweet Dreams are Made of
These', 13 Ghosts unfortunately seems to attempt to capture the spirit of
the previous outing in an almost parody of itself as we hear weird pop music
playing, seemingly slightly out of place.
In my personal opinion, Dark Castle's first film far surpassed the much inferior 13 Ghosts, though I no doubt found myself grinning madly through most of the film. The script seems rather weak and jokes quite lame, but this is no reason to miss the film. Don't go in expecting a Citizen Kane, but do expect a pretty good B-Movie rendition. P.s. They should have given us ghosts viewers.
