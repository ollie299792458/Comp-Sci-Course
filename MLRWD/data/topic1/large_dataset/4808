Other reviewers have accurately stated what a great cinematic achievement this movie is. More enduring for me has always been Prokifiev's score. This is one of those brilliant combinations of the visual and musical arts. Each is wonderful in its own right, but the combination is greater than the sum of the parts; each makes the other that much better. A few years ago I had the extreme pleasure of seeing the movie at Philadelphia's Mann Music Center. The film was projected on a huge outdoor screen and the score was played live by the Philadelphia Orchestra. Gives me a chill even now thinking how stunning the whole experience was. I'm sure other orchestras do this kind of thing. If you *ever* get the chance to see it this way, jump on it! You won't be sorry! In the meantime, the DVD is a great addition to the library of any serious fan of cinema, history and/or music. And while you're at it, why not buy a copy of the score? Personally, I like Andre Previn's 1987 version on Telarc CD-80143, which also includes the Lt. Kije Suite (just do an Amazon search under Classical Music for "nevsky previn kije" and you'll go right to it.)
