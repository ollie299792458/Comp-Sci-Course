This is a wonderful show about teenagers living in a town called Tree Hill.  They all have had there share of trouble.  This show is not like any other series that I have watched in the past.  This series is not just based on one single person everyone has there problems and they are not all the same.

There are essintally five main characters, I would say, they include: Lucus, Nathan, Haliey, Payton, and Brooke.  Lucus is a boy that is struggling to met his father and get to know his own half brother Nathan, both of them do not accept him as family.  Then there is Nathan a trouble boy how is captain of the basketball team and a real party animal.  When dating Payton he is not a very nice guy, he does not like the pay attention to him.  Then he mets Hailey a good girl that decides to totur him, they suddenly become interested in each other and Nathan becomes changed.  Then there is Hailey she is Lucus' best friend nad Nathans newly became tutor, and an all around good girl.  Then there is Payton who is now became Nathans ex-girlfriend and sudden single.  She is a good artist and loves music in every asspect, she begins to like Lucus.  Then Brooke, she is a party girl who likes to have fun, she is Paytons best friend.  She too likes lUcus and this suddenly becomes a love trianlge between the three.

This is a fantastic show for many to watch.  It deals with all the pressures of being in high school and nto knowing what you are going to do with your life.  This is not just a show for girls, it has a story line of basketball as well.  It always shows the realtionships that they have with there parents and some pressure that parents put on their children.  This is a great series and I for one have been hooked since day one, never getting tired of what is to come out of everything and everyone.
