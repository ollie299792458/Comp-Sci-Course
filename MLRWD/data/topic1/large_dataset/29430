Only one deserved hers.
I think even Denzel was shocked by the face-slappingly obvious statement made by the Academy via this token gesture (ie. ""Racism?" Hahaha! That's a funny word. But we don't know what it means! Nuh-uh! Not us!"), since I think even he knew that he never slipped out of 1st gear in a role he could have sleepwalked through. So... you're implying that he was better in this than he was in "The Hurricane"? Don't make me laugh. Oh well, slap another zero on the end of his salary.
The frustrating thing is, the movie itself isn't that bad. In a bloated genre, Training Day plays out like an above-average episode of NYPD Blue, until the eye-rollingly cheesy ending where the crooked cop gets his comeuppance (a combination of a bad spaghetti-western and a ripoff of the Sonny Corleone death scene), completely undermines any credibility the film desperately tried to establish and proceeds to urinate on the ashes. Ho hum. Next on the "Corruption is Naughty" Hollywood conveyer belt, please.
