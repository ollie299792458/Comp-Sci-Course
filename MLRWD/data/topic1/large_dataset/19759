I agree with other reviewers, in that Chinatown is definitely in my top-ten list of all time, as well. I received the BD the end of August (2012) and have just now taken a look at it. My screen is a Panasonic 42 inch Plasma-- absolutely right-on in its video quality, color balance, and all adjustments (made by myself -- and not some Geek-Squad guy!!). I used to be a photographer for many years, so I'm very quick to spot any resolution and color saturation,  tonal discrepancies quickly. My BD player is the Oppo BDP-93 -- fabulous video processor! Read some of the many reviews of this BD player online -- and get one!

Anyway ... back to Jack, and Chinatown. I am very pleased with the quality of this incarnation of this movie: excellent resolution-looking at the rocks, for instance, in an early scene, at the dam (in daylight) where Mulwray is watched by Nicholson from a distance - every rock could be discerned sharply outlined, and crisp. Shadow detail is very good also. Overall contrast is also excellent. I want to say simply, that this BD for me, and on my system, audio included, is first rate, and an easy recommendation for any Chinatown lover. Sit back and enjoy !!

I forgot to make a comment on graininess, mentioned in another, excellent, review. I personally did not see any objectionable, if any, grain at all, from what I have watched so far. I think of the old B&W print days, and various degrees of grain,  be it intended or not. So, in that context, I did not see any obvious grain. I'm not as well versed in the video world yet -- I do wear my distance eye glasses (prescription) for critical viewing on-screen, so I will let you other guys write in more detail about the technical end! :-)
