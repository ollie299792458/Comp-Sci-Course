First of all, I'm not a SCI-FI fan and have never read a single comic book in my life so this review is not based on my previous love/hate of this character or the comic book it is based on.

The one thing I really like in the movie is the lead character of HellBoy and the actor Ron Perlman who played it to near perfection. This was the first time I even knew there's a comic-book character called HellBoy but watching Ron Perlman playing him felt like I know the character for a long time. The plot of the movie in reasonably interesting and you won't feel bored by different twists and turns. The director could've done more on the character development of the other characters except the lead role but the lead character's interestingly funny performance compensates that to quite an extent. This could be because I don't know other characters (as I've never read the comics it is based upon) but many other characters are just like two-dimensional pictures filling the scenery. A little more effort could've brought this movie at par with Spiderman2 where every character is alive and fitting in the movie.

I played this movie for my 4-year old son but both my wife and I ended up watching it and we actually enjoyed this as a family movie. There's no blood and guts flying all over the horizon, there's no vulgarity in the dialogs even when they're spoken by the villains and there're no super-sexy barely dressed female heroes/villains so you can practically sit with your kids and watch this movie ... and enjoy it.
