I am not a comic fan but this is by FAR AND AWAY the BEST Comic Movie of all time.  Seem's like the Comic Punisher fans are "Punishing" this take on the character but really if you look at the movie instead of the character it is a pretty good action flick.

Very Mad Max in your face stuff and I like that kind of "shady" hero.  Because a real hero is just a human with all the faults of a human.

The Character does though have a keen sense of right and wrong and ultimate justice.  Really, Frank Castle is not a hero in the film.  Just a man out to set thing's straight.

Jane is the real star of this flick and does a great job.  I think they could have got someone a little better instead of Travolta though, I would have liked to seen Al Pacino in the role of Mobster Howard Saint.

The best and most disturbing part is the whole family being whacked scene.  Notice how the tension was built up before it actually happened i.e. no music. and little kids playing at the family dinner table.

Very Sergio Leone "Once Upon a Time in the West" stuff where Fonda smiles and then shoots a little kid.

It made the emotional response for Frank's revenge even greater.

Along with Gladiator one of the Best "Revenge" Movies of the decade.
