I believe that this may be the best movie I have ever seen.  It is very profound.  Taking place in a world ravaged by nuclear war, one man dares to stand up against tyranny and oppression and be counted for something he  believes in, even though he stumbles across his belief quite by accident.  This film is about what we can become, united by a common good, as a  nation, to put aside all petty differences, and fight for what is right  even in the face of death and impossible odds.  Freedom is never cheap, and  must always be paid for in blood, which makes it that much more precious.  Once again the critics have failed to see, understand, and comprehend the  significance of this film.  It is not about what we as a nation are, but  what we can become.  
This movie has a tremendous plot, and will draw you  in with its truth, and leave you stunned, in awe.  The acting is great, and  it has some incredible cinematography.  It clocks in at just under three  hours long, on one video cassette, but I promise you will not be  disappointed.  It transpires the original novel by David Brin, which it  follows only loosly, and encapsulates the human race.  In short, just a  really good flick.
