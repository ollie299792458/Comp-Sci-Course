Love this movie....but I don't remember hearing much about it the year that it came out, 1993. It apparently has gained more popularity SINCE it's release. If you grew up in the '70's, as I did, there'll be alot there to bring back memories for you. The director commentary was a bit disappointing for me, as it seemed like the director was reminising more about his own memories from highschool rather than the memories he had of casting/making the film itself.  I think that I recognized Renee Zellweger in a scene: at the beer bust at the moontower, she's the girl in the striped shirt sitting in the back of a pickup truck helping the Parker Posey character dring beer from a funnel. Oh, and another Zellweger sighting in the movie takes place shortly before the Wooderson (McConeghy) line, 'that's what I like about these highschool girls....I get older, they stay exactly the same.'  It's pretty cool to see actors like Matthew McConeghy and Ben Affleck before they became famous......and even actors like Parker Posey, Milla Jojovich, Rory Cochrane, and Adam Goldberg who have since gained fame in more of a character actor genre. Before there was MTV, video games, cell phones.....pretty much all high school age kids had to do during summer in the '70's was ride around in cars and see what was going on. And the whole plot of this movie takes place the last day of school before summer break. And the rising freshmen boys were running scared from the senior boys who were only interested in their hazing ritual.....paddling them with thick, wooden paddles. And the rising freshmen girls didn't escape, either, they were treated like babies, complete with pacifiers, covered with food, and forced to "propose" to senior boys. It's fun to follow the Mitch and Sabrina characters, each fresh from their hazing rituals, being allowed to follow along with the older kids during the day's/night's events. It's alot of retro fun.....
