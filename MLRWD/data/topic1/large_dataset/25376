Season 1 of this show was amazing, so I was delighted that season 2 is even better.  Every character on the show becomes more multi-dimensional this season.  Caroline as a vampire is so amazing.  Her storyline with Tyler has its very own spin-off potentional.  Bonnie turns even more bad-ass as a witch Goddess. Fans of Willow from Buffy will love her power and growth as well as her new love interest this season.  The first half deals with Katherine and the fallout of her arrival.  Then the introduction of the werewolfs takes this show up a notch that Twilight's New Moon couldn't match. The introduction of the original vampires Klaus and Elijah was a work of genius.  I can't think of one thing that would have improved this season. Fans of both Stefan and Damon will find plenty of moments to cheer about this season. However, the best relationship in this show for me is the relationship between the two brothers, Stefan and Damon.  Seeing them come together and often clash to protect Elena is spell-bounding.  Stefan proves over and over he will always do what Elena wants him to do while Damon will always do what he believes is BEST for her or what she needs.  The contrast in the two approaches is amazing. The length Stefan goes to at the end of the season to save his brother is heartwrenching.  This show is for all ages and all fans of the supernatural genre.  My 63 year old father started watching season 1 with me and loved it.  I can't wait until he watches all of season 2.
