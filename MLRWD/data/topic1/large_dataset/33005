BR>I can not get enough of this movie, I have watched it over and over and over again, and it just gets more exciting and funny with each view.
The characters play superbly in their roles. All the relationships are quite admirable, because of their realism, minus the usual hollywood sugar coating! I sympathise with all the characters, despite their dispicable actions in some scenes. Travolta is the most adorable of them all, as he is the type to do things from his heart for other people, but looking cool always comes first (or scoring the chick of his liking!)
I particularly love the scene where he performs the dance sequence to the BeeGees, mesmorizing the whole disco. I also love when Tony and Stephanie hang out, both acting so pretentious, showing each other off, but Tony acts cool, not bothering to even chew his food! And what about the guy who gets a girl pregnant! Poor guy he has SO much on his mind, when his mates go retaliating against a gang called the Spitts, he pussy foots around! THIS IS SO HILARIOUS! When asked, "Where were you??" He says, "I was just driving around, LOOKING FOR YOU!" That cracks me up. But poor Catholic kid! I wont tell you what happens to him.
If you're looking for a good wholesome family entertainment movie, this is not for you. Try Rebel without A Cause, may be.
