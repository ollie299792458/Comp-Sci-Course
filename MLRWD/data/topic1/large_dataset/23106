I'm writing this review as someone who absolutely loves the film "Amadeus."  It really is one of the top ten films made after 1980 -- a gorgeous, engrossing, funny, hugely entertaining achievement.

I'm also writing this review as someone who does not own the Blu-Ray edition and in fact refuses to buy it in its current form, even at the low, low sale price of $13.99.

Why?  And why only two stars?  For one reason and one reason only:  this Blu-Ray edition does not (as far as I can tell) contain the original theatrical release.

When "Blade Runner" was released on Blu-Ray last year, I snatched it up immediately.  I even paid $30+ for it -- gladly.  Why?  There were FIVE DIFFERENT VERSIONS of the film included in the package, including the original release with Harrison Ford's voiceover.

When "The Godfather Trilogy" was released on Blu-Ray, I paid more than $40 for it -- gladly -- because they had ALL THREE Godfather films included in the package.

So it's baffling why they didn't do the same thing with "Amadeus."  At $30+ or even $40+ it would've been a steal.  Without the original theatrical cut, I wouldn't pay more than $5 for this Blu-Ray disc.

I own the standard-definition DVDs of "Amadeus" -- both the original theatrical version (released in 1997!!) AND the Director's Cut that was released a few years later.  While the Director's Cut DOES make some things a little clearer in the story, nothing in the Director's Cut -- NOTHING -- makes it a better film.  With all due respect to Milos Forman, the original theatrical version is VASTLY SUPERIOR to the Director's Cut.  The storytelling is tighter, the film more engrossing.  The scenes that were added in the Director's Cut with Kenneth MacMillan and the barking dogs would've been better in a Deleted Scenes section of the DVD -- they're extraneous, superfluous.  Too many notes.

It's like the French plantation sequence in "Apocalypse Now" (ANOTHER DVD package that was smart enough to include both the "Redux" version AND the original theatrical release), where you can't wait for the director's self-indulgent digression to end so you can get back to the story.

I would MUCH prefer to watch my 1997 standard-definition DVD of the original theatrical release than pay more than $5 for this Blu-Ray edition.  If you've never seen the film, I envy you -- you'll love it.  But don't buy this version.  Get this one instead:  http://www.amazon.com/Amadeus-F-Murray-Abraham/dp/6304712936/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1237481543&sr=8-2

The picture quality won't be as good as Blu-Ray, but you'll be seeing a better film.
