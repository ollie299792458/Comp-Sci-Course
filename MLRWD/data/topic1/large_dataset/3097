I had the great luck of screening the US release of this film recently.
Before I list the good, I'll list my one and only complaint:  
It is quite gory.  If you have difficulty with gore, bring someone with you to the theater who can tell you when you can look up again.  On video or DVD, there's always fast-forward.
Now on to everything else:
This movie is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.  The cinematography is inventive, unique, and truly gorgeous.  The use of odd camera angles and slowing of time (more subtle than The Matrix) make the simplest shots (i.e. feet landing in a puddle of mud) a thrill to watch.
Some of the most incredible fight sequences grace this movie, most starring cult-favorite Mark Dacascos.  This is probably some of his most beautiful work, giving us a broad spectrum of his great skills.  It's also quite obvious that the cuts used during his fight sequences are only there cinematic effect, and not for lack of ability or stamina.  Some of his moves (all without wire-work) will leave you breathless.
See it in the theaters, and buy it when it comes out on video.  You won't regret it.
