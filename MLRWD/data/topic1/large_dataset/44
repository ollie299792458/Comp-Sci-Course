Not being knowledgeable about movie techniques, I base my comments strictly on feelings aroused by the movie:

puzzlement - if they are immigrating from Ireland why are they driving across a border (finally realized they came in illegally through Canada)?  Who is this Frankie they keep talking about (Oh, it's the deceased son)?  What did they say (wish they wouldn't mumble some of the important lines)?

Sadness - Once you get tuned in, the family's adjustment to America, to being poor, to living in a slum, to not finding work, to finding each other after the horrible loss in their life... it's sad.

Joy - the moments where the family successfully connects or communicates with each other, or with their neighbors, particularly the black artist evoke feelings of joy.

Beauty - despite the depressing setting and the depressing loss of Frankie, the family is beautiful and their innocence touches even the dying neighbor who before was consumed with anger at his fatal disease.

In the final summing up, it is a movie that touches you, makes you think, and sticks in your mind.  Isn't that what movie making is all about?
