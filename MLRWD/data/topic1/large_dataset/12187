I am basing this review on the IMAX, as the DVD is not out yet.  I cannot comment of the audio / video quality (although I reckon it'll be top) nor on the extra features, so the following is a comment on the content and the story.
Captain Shacklton embarked on a journey to reach Antarctica, with a handful of courageous and well-spirited crew persons.  Before long, their ship was blocked before reaching shore, and then sunk (8 months later), by the mounting ice, and they started fighting for their survival.
Even during the most depressing times, the men always trained the dogs, played soccer, and teased each other, waiting for somebody to rescue them.  But shackleton finally realised that only they would be able to save themselves.  He went on a colossal journey with a few men on a tiny boat, to save all the others that were still waiting.
This is a story of courage, strength, endurance, and devotion that perhaps would never be matched again.  An extraordinary story of people who place there fate blindly in others, and of team spirit.
The scenes also include many footages (B&W) that were taken by the ship cameraman.  These too are amazing.
Not to mention that the cinematography and the directing are outstanding.
