I didnt see this film at the theatre, however it was one that I wanted to.  I was just too lazy and didnt take the time to see it.  However, I did pre-order, and I couldnt wait to see it.  As a big fan of African American romance on film (my favorite Love Jones, shot in my home, Chi-town), this movie really moved me. The characters were so real, and you cared what happened to each of them.  Right now, Im in love with Sanaa Lathan, and what man wouldnt be, after watching this film?  She did an excellent job, as did Omar.  The chemistry was unreal, or I should say, too real.  When she loses the basketball game against Omar, for a split second, I felt MY heart break.  There are few films where the love scenes have a real effect on my heart.  This is one of the few.  We need more movies like this for African Americans.  The DVD package is great.  They've offered so much more than the film here, with the DVD ROM stuff to the blooper reel and deleted scenes, which were all great to watch.  I couldnt get enough of this film, if I could give it 10 stars, I would.
