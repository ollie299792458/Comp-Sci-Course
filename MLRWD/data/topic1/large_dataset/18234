For anyone who loves a good western, the "Lonesome Dove" movies are a must see. I ordered Comanche Moon and soon realized it was part of the Lonesome Dove story. After ordering more movies, sometimes out of order I finally got them all. Here is the list according to order if you want to watch the story from beginning to end.

#1...Dead Man's Walk
#2...Comanche Moon
#3...Lonesome Dove
#4...Return To Lonesome Dove
#5...Lonesome Dove The Series
#6...Lonesome Dove The Outlaw Years
#7...Streets Of Loredo

A few years pass between Comanche Moon and Lonesome Dove. Lonesome Dove & Return To Lonesome Dove are like watching one movie. It picks up right where Lonesome Dove left off. In my opinion the best two movies of the seven, although all are worth watching.
Lonesome Dove The Outlaw Years has the same charactors, but it is 22 episods. It reminded me a bit like Gunsmoke, the same town, the same people, but a different story each week. They are all good, just not a continous story. If you watch all 7 movies you will have approx. 60 hours of entertainment. Very enjoyable, and you will feel like you're back in the 1980's. There are so many different charactors and so much happens, I plan on watching it over again many times. You will follow the lives of Gus McCrea & Woodrow Call. It is quite addicting. You will enjoy each movie and wanting more.
The only complaint is there is a few things left un resolved. It's almost like there should have been a few more movies to tell the entire story.
I highly recommend these movies.
