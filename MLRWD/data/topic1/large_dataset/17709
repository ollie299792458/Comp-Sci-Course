Hero is a Directed by the fatastic Zhang Yi Mou. A very respected and highly recognized Asian Film director. Hero is his first Martial Arts film and he has done the right thing with this.
The story is about "nameless" telling truth and lies about the journey to assinate the Qin King. Other characters are Broken sword and flying snow and moon. The acting is very good. The special effects are extrodinary. The story line may be allitle confusing for some but because the film is so addictive, you will want to watch it again and go deeper into the film and once you get the film's deeper plot, you will say "yay/wow"
In amtial arts films, the fighting films aren't that exciting, just punch kick, punch kick. This one, the fighting is so graceful and smooth. This IS AUTHENTIC fighting and you can see how nice they move. The camera work in the film make the fighting scenes very dynamic and calming, like the fight in the chess court. The acting is very good, script is good ( subtitles are easy to understand) There is actually meaning to this film than just swish and slashing. There is emotion in this film. This film should not be compared with Crouching tiger Hidden dragon as Crouching tiger hidden dragon is badly made. Crouching... is a lame, try-hard asian film only directly for international audiences (no offence. The plot is horrible, the fighting is silly, the acting is horrible and the whole thing is just plain awful but Hero is a fantastic film that should be watched and appreciated. Some people avoic international films as they don't get the power and dynamics of the film but they are wrong. Reading subtitles is no harm, it is actually good!
Watch this film! don't avoid! []GOOOD!
