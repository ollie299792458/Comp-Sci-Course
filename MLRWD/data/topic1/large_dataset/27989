I bought "Under Suspicion" in the first place because it is with Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman, both favorite actors of mine. They both give a great performance but on the whole I was a bit disappointed in the movie. The plot drags along somehow maybe because there is not much suspense or action and the ending is predictable. There are no scenes which touch on human emotions and the characters are not very likeable. But it is worth watching just for the acting of Freeman and Hackman. Both actors are brilliant and sure made the best out of their roles. The theme is nothing new. For me it was a bit strange that a character like the one Gene Hackman is playing couldn't hold out such an interrogation without getting completely confused and disconcerted about what had really happened. But who knows? No one can hold out indefinitely. There is probably a limit for everyone. But if you like Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman you definitely have to see this movie just because of their acting is brilliant, no matter whether you like the story or not.
