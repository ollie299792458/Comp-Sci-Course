One line: Amazing movie.

At first I was dismayed when I heard that Pixar was making another Toy Story movie.  This came after their relationship with Disney was shakey, with rumors that a separate non-pixar team would take over the work of this production.  I stayed away from looking up anything related to this film, anxious that what I would learn would break my heart.  The trailers deliberately did not reveal much regarding the plot of the film so I was pretty much kept ignorant right up to watching it.

My goodness, it was breathtaking when I finally saw it.

Anyone who has felt that little tug when they left home, when they had just launched from the nest, will understand immediately the hart of this movie.  The nostalgia, the sentimental feelings.  All of it, distilled perfectly.  This movie somehow has kept that same charm and personality from the first film.  Wonderfully inventive and with that irreproducible Pixar polish, this film will grab you in a big bear hug and not let go, even after the credits have stopped rolling.

Regarding the blu ray.  Sharp, clear, good sound.  It's a digital film w/ a digital transfer.  Straightforward.  The Incredibles still has the better behind the scenes stuff, though.  This one is OK.  Fun commentary.
