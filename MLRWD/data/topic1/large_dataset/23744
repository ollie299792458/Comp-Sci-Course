I have to say, my expectations were low going into this, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I've seen a lot of Arnold's movies, some great, some not so great.  This one is definitely near the top.

Arnold plays a firefighter whose wife and son were killed by terrorists.  This is actually a multidimensional character.  He is enraged by the killing of his wife and son and wants revenge, tries to be a killer as well, yet at his core, he remains a man who wants to save lives.  I was reminded of how good an actor Arnold can be.

Yes, some parts of the plot are a stretch, but frankly, no more fantastical than the story of a kid from Austria becoming a huge Hollywood star, then California governor, all after getting through the door by way of bodybuilding.  This movie came out around the time Arnold began to let his political aspirations be known, and I can't help but think it's politics that colors many of the negative views expressed here.  Also, this movie definitely took a hit at the box office given its subject matter, following so closely on the heals of 9-11.

If you're on the fence with this one, don't get turned off by some of the poor reviews here.  Check it out.  Citizen Kane or Chinatown it ain't.  But it is a thoroughly entertaining action movie, with a little bit of depth and shades of grays.
