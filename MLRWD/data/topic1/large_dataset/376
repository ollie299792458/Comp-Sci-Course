I just went an saw "The Great Raid" this evening, and I enjoyed it.  I recommend that others see it to.  As a child of two survivors from this war, I would say that it has great athenticity.  My father was a civilian who was held prisonner at Cabatanuan, but was unfortunately shipped to Japan in a hell ship prior to the great raid, so therefore he did enjoy freedom yet.  He was one of ten men...and a civilian involved in the smuggling of food and money into the camp.  My father was an American who had learned the filipino language and was put in charge by the Japanese to lead the water buffalo caravans to transport food to the camp.  He was in contact with Margaret Untinsky via the underground fighters.  This was a nonfictional story my father participated in and is written about in a book by Margaret Utinsky called "I Miss You".  My father like Margaret Utinsky was awarded the "The Medal of Freedom".  I enjoyed and respected this movie because of the honest portrait that it attempted to dipict of how war is hell and not some fictional heroics of "Saving Private Ryan".  War is very straightforward and people suffer and get killed. People do not stand up and utter lines of grandeur for the purpose of garning an oscar.  They do what is necessary to survive and help others survive.  I am a half breed of Filipion and American parents, and I have heard my father and mother talk about the suffering from which a lot of good people died.  They did what they had to do as is portayed in this movie.  If you want to see a straightforward story see this movie.  If not then stay home.
