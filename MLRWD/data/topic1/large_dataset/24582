Same material, if it was given to a Hollywood A-list director, one would undoubtedly get an action-packed summer blockbuster, complete with super-duper pyrotechnics, simultaneously impressive and uninspiring stunts and special effects, melodramatic heroism, and perhaps even licensed merchandises at your local burger joint. The slow-burning first half of the movie, which perfectly accentuates the sense of existentialist ennui? Not likely. Hollywood knows what the average attention span of a popcorn muchin', soda guzzling audience is. A subtle sub-context, which extends the surface material to a powerful three-dimensional structure? Sorry, Jose. The big guys want you to watch a movie, forget it, and move on to the next action-packed extravaganza. A decidedly pessimistic, totally ironic ending that pushed the envelope of absurdity? Not a chance. Hollywood folks are such a fun bunch, they want everyone goes home happy. It's quite sickening to see that most movies come out Hollywood are not even bold enough to a story as is, and to portray life as is. Contrary to what Hollywood wanted people to believe, life is not all that happy and cheery. Life is filled with absurdities, cowardice, ennui, and ironic turns of events. What makes this 50 year old movie stands out of a sea of mediocrity, is that it has the audacity to show life's ugly underbelly without a sugar-coated Hollywood ending.
