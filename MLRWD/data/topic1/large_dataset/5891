Maureen O'Hara does a great job portraying the grand dame.  This movie shows an older John Wayne with weaknesses such as needing glasses to read.  The best part of the movie, for me, is that John Wayne's character has been separated from his wife and family for nearly 10 years and has not been in anyone's eye.  This is the basis for the line the character is faced with throughout the movie, "I thought you were dead." Richard Boone's acting is superb and, at times, John Wayne's acting is especially good.  However there is so much hokey in this movie, that it is laughable.  There are also a great many mistakes and it is fun to watch for them.  One that I haven't heard mentioned is when John Wayne is browbeating the head of the Texas Rangers, and the head of Texas Rangers admits to having no water.  However, the three cards are shown on the road in a prior scene with a water bag on each side of the front bumper.

This movie is a fantasy and to enjoy it, we must suspend disbelief.  If you have the right attitude, this is really a fun movie to watch.  If you must have a good plot, good acting, and good film cutting, this really isn't a movie for you.  It is what I like to call a fun movie.  You can put your brain in neutral and just coast along with it.
