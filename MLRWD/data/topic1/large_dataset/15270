Gal pals Thelma and Louise hit the road for escape and adventure and the unknown. Are they looking for a new life or running from life?  Or both?  From the opening shot of an empty desert highway stretching to the horizon, we intuitively know that the end of the road is coming.

Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are terrific as two lost souls trying to take control. At times bitter and angry, this is a feminist manifesto that forces the viewer to ride along on this fatalistic trip to the edge and beyond.

Ridley Scott's superb eye and confident direction give writer Callie Khouri's compact screenplay the emotional sheen it needs to keep the viewer aligned with the protagonists.

We think, if we could only love them, then everything will be OK.  We feel the damage and abuse they have suffered and are sympathetic to their dilemma. But it's too late. They have made up their minds to take us over the edge and it is horrible and beautiful.  Ahhh, sweet release.

This has been called the first mainstream lesbian hit film.  (R, widescreen, 129 minutes)
