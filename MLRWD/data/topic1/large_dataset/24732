Well, I walked into the theater not knowing what to expect at all.  It was opening night, so I hadn't read any reviews yet.  The trailers looked awesome, but the trailers for Darkness were also good trailers.  And anyone who's seen Darkness knows how bad it is.  Ok, on with the review.  Michael Keaton's character has lost his wife, who is an author.  He soon meets a man on the street who says he can help him contact her again.  Naturally, Michael Keaton's character doesn't believe this for a couple of months.  It's something called 'white noise'.  The spirits can be detected through recorded video tapes, and also audio tapes.  He does manage to contact her, and becomes obsessive...until he releases something evil that is seeking him.

I enjoyed this movie THOROUGHLY.  I can tell you that much.  It's very underrated, and I wish that all these people would stop bashing it.  The slow pace helps build up for the great little ending, which I personally enjoyed.  The storyline was pretty good and had a mixture of many different supernatural flicks in it.  Like, Poltergeist and Ghost for example.  It ends up being a very creepy and entertaining flick, and one that you can walk out of the theater feeling good that you just spent 8 bucks on it.  So, overall, I'd definately reccomend this and I'm getting the DVD.
