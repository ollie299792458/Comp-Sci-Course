Words, words, words -- Hamlet is just that: woven into our consciousness; or as text on the page; or delivered on stage. And when enacted, pacing is everything, and staging can be minimal, as is so clearly demonstrated in the current Globe Theatre tragical-comical race-built touring production (UK & USA) with Dickon Tyrrell and Michael Benz, Hamlet in a nutshell, in which most of the cast play many parts. [The closest thing on DVD being The Taming of the Shrew by The American Conservatory Theatre of San Francisco.]

The other extreme of this spectrum is the infinite space of this widescreen movie, in which Hamlet is played by Kenneth Branagh; Claudius by Derek Jacobi; Gertrude by Julie Christie; Ophelia by Kate Winslett; and Laertes by Michael Maloney (always matchless in the clarity and energy of his delivery, himself a perfect Hamlet on stage). And so it goes on, Branagh's dream team. Even the minimal parts are all played by major actors, each adding his own weight of experience to this full-text production.

Branagh's precision choreography of the camera is equal to anything in the movies of Orson Welles or Miklos Jansco, the big lens forensic in its microscopic dissection of the protagonists entangled in this murder most foul.

Easily the best Hamlet available on DVD.

It can not give you such delights as seeing Miranda Foster's player queen, hilariously overacted while at the same time sinuously beautiful, or her pop-up gravedigger (2nd Clown), but you will find that buying the DVD is much cheaper (though a lot less fun) than trying to follow the current Globe production on tour. But catch both if you can.
