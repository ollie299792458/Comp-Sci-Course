Don't get me wrong, I *adore* this DVD. The special features are fantastic, including things like a glossary for the vocabulary-challanged, like myself, and an interview with the guy who did the soundtrack (blanking on his name) which gives one a new appreciation for the music of Akira. Like we needed any more proof that it was a masterpiece. I probably would've given this a three, however, if it were just the movie. I saw the movie once about a year ago, and forgot most of it because I didn't understand what was going on half the time. (Although watching it in the middle of the night probably didn't help.) Then a friend handed me the manga (all six of them!) and I devoured them in three days. After that, I watched the movie again, but was somewhat disappointed, as the plotlines are subtly different between the two. But don't let me disuade you! The incredible animation and enthralling music *alone* are worth the buy. Add in the special features, and what is still a pretty damned good anime, dispite the flaws, and I don't think you could get a whole lot better.
