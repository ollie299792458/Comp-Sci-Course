This movie was ok... It was one of those films you walk out of unchanged...like it didn't matter if you had seen it or not.  The movie didn't quite hold my full attention...I found myself wondering when it was going to be over but there were some good aspects of the film.  I really enjoyed the documentary-like feel to the movie- it made the story really come to life as if the viewer were there.  It was also a good depiction of highschool football, in that, these guy's lives turned into a fight to win and nothing else.  They had one motive and no other aspects to their lives.  However, as good a depiction it was- I think the movie lacked character developement.  Some of the guys we get to know- but others not so much.  The film opens with the quarter back and this makes the viewer assume that he will be a driving character for the movie but we really don't get to know him all that well.  This is a flaw with numerous other characters as well- the movie really only shows you the surface level of some the guys.  So I couldn't really get that emotionally involved.  But the movie did stur up some tears, so i do reccomend seeing it if you are a football fan- but maybe as just a rental-
