This is a review of the movie, not the DVD. Ellen Burstyn plays Alice, a widow with a young son, whose dream is to make it as a singer in Monterey, CA. After her husband's death she and her son go on the road. She hooks up with a cowboy (Harvey Keitel) but runs away from his violent temper. In another town Alice gets a job as a waitress at Mel's Diner to save up enough money to complete her trip to California. This is the basis for the TV series "Alice", starring Linda Lavin. Alice gets to know co-workers Flo (Polly Holliday) and Mel (Vic Tayback) and a rancher played by Kris Kristofferson. She becomes romantically involved with Kris but is afraid that getting tied down will destroy her dream of fame and fortune as a singer. Her son, meanwhile, finds a new friend (a pre-teen Jodie Foster). She's more worldly than he is and that's all I'll say about that. All in all the movie is a charming tale of how your dreams can evolve and move in directions you never expected. There are laughs and tears and even some pretty good songs. Ellen Burstyn's performance as a woman approaching middle age and trying to make it in the working (and dating) world is excellent. I hope the DVD does the movie justice.
