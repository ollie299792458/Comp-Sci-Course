To be sure, Something's Gotta Give is a formula movie populated with formula types. Nicholson, for example, plays the same sort of hate-to-love-him misfit who redeems himself before the credits that he played in the more original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767811100">As Good As It Gets</a>. Having said that, the quality of the acting and directing make this as good as formula gets; which is to say, quite enjoyable.

The characterizations, and the choices the characters make, are sure to ruffle the feathers of those with an ideological axe to grind. But ideological commitments are hardly the basis for a romance, or a successful relationship. Reeves is charming as the earnest, smart younger man who does everything right. The dilemma for Keaton's character is that he doesn't understand her the way that Nicholson's character does.

My biggest disappointment is not with the choice Keaton's character makes--the movie would work either way. What's disappointing is that a character who has been portrayed as an intelligent, mature adult ultimately has her choice made for her. In that sense, the ending of the movie is a cop-out.
