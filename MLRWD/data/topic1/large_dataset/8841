Will the two stars get it on, make-out, or at least have a pillow fight? That's the question you the viewer will spend the movie asking, waiting in breathless anticipation for an answer. Well I'm not gonna give it to you. You'll have to watch it to find out. I wouldn't want to spoil the delicious anticipation you'll feel especially since it will keep you tuned in when things get slow. I will say that the girls have a scene where, dressed as French show girls, Salma teaches Penelope how to kiss a man so that he'll never forget her. Also Penelope as a crack pistol shot is hot, and Salma as an expert with knives in even hotter. There's some kind of plot and cowboys and such although really this could have taken place in medieval Europe, feudal Japan or Jupiter's third moon (Ganymede smart guy!) and still have kept most of it's appeal. It was made mostly to get the two lovely stars together. And what a constellation they make! (Sorry!) Salma throws some decent bad girl attitude and Penelope is just as fetching as the sweetie-pie trying to act like a Toughie. Steve Zahn does his thing, this time as an Old-West CSI-type Pinkertonesque detective, which is always welcome. There's also a bit of an anti-corporate, pro-little guy message, and some corny humor, which makes for good viewing when mixed with the stars' natural charm and beauty. A good time. I actually look forward to a sequel.
