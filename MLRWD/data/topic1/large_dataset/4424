This Criterion release of Vampyr is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.19:1, a European format that is narrower than a 1.33:1 image.. This new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit 2K Datacine from a 35 mm fine-grain master positive which removed thousands  of instances of debris and scratches from the negative.
Criterion also tells us the DVD was encoded at the highest-possible bit rate for the quantity of material included.
This edition includes a wealth of extras including:* Audio commentary featuring film scholar Tony Rayns
*  a documentary by J&ouml;rgen Roos chronicling Dreyer's career
* Visual essay by scholar Casper Tybjerg ( commentary on "Mikael" by Eureka video) on Dreyer's influences in creating Vampyr
