Vera Drake is set in post-war 1950's and starts out as a lovely film about an endearing, kind, caring older woman, almost the ideal grandmother.  Then we are introduced to the subject of the film, abortion.  But the way this is done really shows the broad range of people involved with that issue, from judges and police, to psychiatrists and money-grubbing profiteers and somewhere in there is the lovely well-intentioned Very Drake who truly convincingly does what she does out of 'love' for troubled young women.  Its a fabulous film on so many levels, inviting us to question just how dangerous the actions of even the best-intentioned people can sometimes be.  On another level its about responsible medicine and the dangers of non-medical people assuming knowledge in medical areas with no recall or follow up for those they 'treat'.  The ultimate victims here end up being the family and the film captures brilliantly Vera as the blind optimist who seems never even to have considered this side effect of her actions.  Its a powerful film which seems almost politically neutral on the subject and yet manages to shed light on every facet of it in the most starkest of ways.
