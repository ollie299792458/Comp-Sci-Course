This review is regarding the awful packaging of this product, and not of the merits of the show itself. Eureka is a show that you either love or hate. If you fall into the hate category, you're not going to be considering buying it anyway.

The DVD trays are made out of potatoes. Really. The product is so soft, the discs will not stay in place no matter how careful you try to close the case, and they wind up slipping out of the bottom. It's sort of like a fine grain Styrofoam. The sliding around smudges the discs, and leaves tiny specks of material clinging to them.

The material is supposed to be environmentally friendly. That would be great if this were a disposable product, but who buys DVD sets and throws away the packaging? I also can't imagine that this material is going to have a very long shelf life - especially if it were to get exposed to humidty and/or heat.

Stoopid, stoopid, stoopid. I might have to cannibalize plastic inserts from somewhere else and glue them into the sleeve.
