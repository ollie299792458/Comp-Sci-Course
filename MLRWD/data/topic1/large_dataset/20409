For a long time, I thought about writing a review for Death at a funeral. It is one of the best films I've seen this year. It is infact the funniest film I've seen in the last 2-3 years. The story is based on the happenings at a funeral, there are several characters and they all are English. There is something about the English which seems more tolerable, maybe it's their accent or that particular side of their personalities to choose to be a bit lowkey about. Whatever it is, it works alarmingly well. I think I had tears in my eyes laughing. I've made all my good friends see this and they all loved it. My sister just finished watching it and she thought it was the best film ever. I thought it was an instant cult classic (Whether that's true or not, who cares)

Strengths of the film - No boring characters, it's only 1hour 26 mins and ridiculously funny, character growth, druggy behaviour, old people, irritation and more irritation. Jerry Seinfeld recently said on Conan O Brien that "irritation" is the single funniest thing in humor. He was right. Death at a Funeral will not irritate you but seeing how irritated the characters are becoming, you will fall of your chair or couch or  seat. Some people said this film was predictable. I think the same people should go and watch Scary Movies.
