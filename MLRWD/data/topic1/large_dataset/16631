Some critics might call some of these classic action heroes "dumb" characters based on their past performances with all brains and little brawn, but they've already missed the point of what these heroes, like Stallone (Rocky, Rambo), Jean Claude van Damme (Hard Target, Blood Sport) or Arnold Schwarzenegger (Conan, Terminator) are all about: Kicking @ss.

And from the start to finish, that's what Expendables 2 does, blasting off with an intro action scene that's usually reserved for the ENDING of most action movies, just to put things in perspective for what's in store. Most of the classic 80's heroes are here in top form despite their age, and this movie is a celebration of action movies in general.

Great pacing as there is an action scene waiting around the next corner, with Stallone offering a brutal, gory tone no doubt inspired by his latest RAMBO film. Expendables 2 has plenty of light hearted moments with a comical tone despite the vicious action of bullets and martial arts.

For great, fun and no holds barred action, buy Expendables 2 to add to your action collection.

Suggestions for Expendables 3 cast are debatable, but I wouldn't mind seeing Wesley Snipes (pending release) Jackie Chan, Hulk Hogan, The Rock, but also quite a few other overlooked heroes of the past make at the very least, a cameo action scene as they did with Chuck Norris in part 2.
Some might even suggest for some female heroes, Milla Jovovich, Sigourney Weaver or Kate Beckinsale, but that's probably pushing it for the future films if the series goes past 3.
