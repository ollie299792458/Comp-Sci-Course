I first purchased this movie in Hong Kong as I'm a fairly faithful Jet Li fan.  However, I always felt that the version I saw was missing something.  It seemed as if it couldn't decide what genre it wanted to belong to.

Then I saw the director's cut on blu-ray.  It was a double whammy!  The movie as told in this version is a tale of a man who must come to terms with an unspeakable tragedy.  How he overcomes his own trials and becomes a hero to a nation.  What it is not is a "Wi-fu" flick.  In fact the kung fu seems to serve only one purpose:  To show the viewer the difference in fighting for selfish ends and fighting for a more noble purpose.

The picture and sound are noticeably better than the DVD release, but the greatest treasure is the story itself.  You understand his motives, his grief.  If you go in thinking Unleashed or Fists of Fury or even Crouching Tiger (not that he's in the last), you'll be disappointed.

My wife typically does not watch "kung fu" movies, but she sat through it.  She even asked that I pause it when she needed to get up.  A sure sign she's hooked.

The only gripe, was the very beginning with Michelle Yeoh.  I didn't think it was necessary.

As always, rent before you buy, because otherwise, you have noone to blame but yourself.
