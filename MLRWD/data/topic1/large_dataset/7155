Clint Eastwood is Gunnery Sergeant Highway, a Korea and Vietnam war veteran who survived a horrific battle in Korea referred to as Heartbreak Ridge and received the Medal of Honor for his actions.  He's a warrior on the battlefield, but his aggressive, hard-drinking, and frank attitude has cost him promotion and his marriage.  Nearing retirement, he receives orders to return to his elite specialty of Force Reconnaissance.  Upon arrival, the battalion's operations officer treats Gunny as an outdated warrior, and he finds his new platoon comprised of misfits.  He also learns that his ex-wife still resides locally earning a living as a cocktail waitress.  Gunny commences to whipping his young Marines into shape while tangling with his ex-wife to repair their failed marriage.  Meanwhile, Gunny is one step away from  being under-mined and kicked out by his nemesis.  The film culminates with Gunny's Marine battalion deployed to intervene the crisis on the Island of Grenada (actual operation in 1983), with his reconnaissance platoon leading the way into combat.  It is here where the plot unfolds to reveal if Gunny's training has worked, and if his wife will return to him.  The story is likable, but it suffers from immature male humor, and a lot of profanity.  The feature has significant technical flaws such as an absence of other officers in the battalion, and Gunny's dangerous training methods that would probably result in his being relieved from duty - not to mention a particularly disturbing scene during the Grenada operation when Gunny is portrayed killing a wounded enemy soldier.  The movie is entertaining, but definitely not to be taken seriously.
