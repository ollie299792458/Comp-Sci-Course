Thank god, FINALLY a horror film that doesn't simply follow all the rules, doing the paint by numbers routine that Hollywood has developed.  The Host is refreshingly original, moving, sometimes hysterical, and other times terrifying.... I like to describe it as Jurassic Park meets Little Miss Sunshine.  You've got your monster (which, even though the CGI is sometimes lacking, the animation, movement, and personality of the monster is brilliant), and then you've got your (sometimes funny, sometimes sad) dysfunctional family trying to get through the disaster and be there for each other.

Note 1) Do not watch the English dubbing, it is awful.

2) For those reviewers who mention the anti-American slant, it's not quite true - the opening scene (the origin of the monster), where a Korean is told by an American general to dump tons of formaldehyde into the Han river is NOT anti-American propaganda, it is a recreation of an actual event that happened in 2005.  So, uh... yeah.

3) It is very different from American monster movies... this is a good thing.  The characters and their relationships to each other are actually fairly engaging.

Check out The Host, go in with an open mind, and have a great time.
