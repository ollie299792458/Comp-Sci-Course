This edition of the 1967 classic is so far the definitive edition. The featurettes are very informative and entertaining. Seeing the Bergmans (lyricists) on screen to talk about their creations on the soundtrack, and the entire segment about Quincy Jones made the purchase well worth it. It was neat to learn that it is Glen Campbell singing "Knock Kneed Paul", but I would have loved to have learned more about the song "Foul Owl", the funky theme for Ralph.

One complaint that I would have liked to seen rectified was that the transfer was not a remaster. It was the same transfer from the previous DVD release, with no picture quality improvements. There some washouts and some points where color correction is needed, even though the film has held up rather well over the years.

If you are searching for a very memorable film about one of the core points of humanity, with a satisfying climax and a plot that will leave you thinking, then watch "In the Heat of the Night". If you are looking for good featurettes and interesting commentary, then this version is the one you need.
