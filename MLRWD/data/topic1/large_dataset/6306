My wife rented this movie last week for our almost-three-year-old son. Little did she expect that he and I would watch this movie about six times before returning it, and now we just bought it for him (us) as a gift for Christmas. The first run-through, our son didn't always pay his full attention to it, mainly because he's used to his mainstays (Cars, Toy Story, Nemo, Monster's Inc., and The Incredibles -- he's already following in Daddy's footsteps as a Pixar junkie), but the next day when asked what movie he wanted to watch, he asked for Kung Fu Panda. Since then he's been infatuated with the entire cast of characters. He especially likes the villain (should I be worried?).

This movie reinforces the lessons of "aspire to dream," "follow your dream," "don't judge a book by its cover,"...and also, of course, "always do your best." Anyway, this is a great movie, great animation, great story, and a great buy. Even for almost-three-year-olds as well as 38-year-olds. :-)

Oh yes, and don't be afraid of exposing your kids to the craziness that is Jack Black. He knows when to turn his Tenacious D off and on a la School of Rock or even King Kong, for that matter.
