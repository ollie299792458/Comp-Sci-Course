This movie is terrible, nothing -absolutely nothing- is original about it, the plot is cookie cutter ad the characters are cartoonish at best. So the story goes like this: A widow and her two kids ( a teenager, and a brat) are moving to a house on the hills of pennsylvania, so the mom is driving when all of sudden the brat screams and she sees someone crossing the road so she must make a hard steer. Then, they arrive at the house and oh surprise it's a sty, so they all go to bed and the mom has a dream where she's stabbed and wakes up panicked only to find blood on the door of the house... And so begins the journey filled with trite 'scares' and situations:

*teenagers smoking and drinking in the woods
*the little girl who befriends someone only she can see/hear
*the same little girl getting lost on the wood while playing with her 'friend'
*teenager gets out of the car to play a prank on their friends and gets killed
*Weirdo character who understands how the curse works, yet won't tell anyone
*Evil character who must die in order for the 'things' to rest

And a ton more, it's like whoever directed this embarrassment saw every friday the 13th, halloween, 90's n&uuml;-slash, etc. movies and extracted every stock situation and put them in 'Wicked little things' it's just shameful. Stay away from this lazy movie.
