Whether one wants to admit it or not, if you were ever in a relationship that was going through a rocky time I'm sure there is some aspect of this film that you could relate to in some way, shape, or form.  This is a film that hits a real emotional element in people who are going through or who have gone through a rocky relationship.  The Story of Us is a film about two people who have come to a critical point in their relationship where it's time to decide if they go on to the next phase of their relationship or if they put an end to their story.  In every relationship this point comes, whether the couple is married or whether they are just dating, there comes a point in all relationships where it's time to decide if it's a relationship worth sustaining and striving to improve, or if the relationship has reached it's end.  The Story of Us does a good job in showing both sides of the relationship, the starting out point where everything is fresh and exciting and full of passion and the diminishing side which shows the fights and anguish.  It's a poignant movie that anyone who is in a relationship or who has ever been in one should see for it almost forces you to look and examine how you are in your own relationships.
