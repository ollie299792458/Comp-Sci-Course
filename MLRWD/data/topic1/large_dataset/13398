Broadcast News is a minute glimpse into the world of the Fourth Estate. It provides the viewer with an insight into the lives of three budding journalists. Amidst their differences, these three journalists have two things in common. All three of them are highly ambitious and share a sense of determination that it takes to achieve their goals. The movie also reveals the hard work that goes into the creation of a great journalist, and the thrills and spills that come with being a member of the media. But the movie also provides the viewer with a glance of something different - the loneliness that accompanies all the pomp and glory. It is as though it is a mesage to those aspiring to be journalists - "The road is rough, and if you don't think you can handle the ride, get off before it's too late." In other words, the view that the life of a journalist is standing in front of a camera and reading a script is a facade. The movie reveals the reality and the harshness involved with living the life of a jornalist.
