It's interesting that this late '90's franchise derived from the 60's first major example of what the folks at "Seinfeld" might refer to as the "about nothing" syndrome. That original film was little more than a visualization of the tabloid interest in the lives of the Rat Packers, and a sad late career addition to the resume of the estimable Lewis Milestone ("All Quiet on the Western Front", etc.) I would say that the original producers, at least, knew enough to stop at a single installment. However, such marginal "entertainments" as "Sergeants 3" and "Robin and the 7 Hoods" were sort of sequels. Obviously, the new series also exists primarily because of the interest in celebrities named Clooney, Pitt and Damon. I found even the superior first entry to be of limited interest. I missed the roundly panned second, and was uninvolved in this ultimate sequel...... except when Al Pacino is present. Hardly his best work, but he's just such an interesting actor. His "Sea of Love" co-star Ellen Barkin is wasted in a demeaning turn as a tough as nails, yet unbelievably mooney minion of Pacino. Finally, I concur with another review which mentioned the quality of the regular DVD. This is by far the worst major studio transfer I have seen. It's chock full of artifacts, visual distortion, and Low-Fi sound.
