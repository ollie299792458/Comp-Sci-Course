Growing up as a Catholic, one is taught of the realm known as Purgatory to be something of a neutral holding tank for the departed earth souls awaiting their final destination in either Heaven or Hell.  Beyond that, not much of Purgatory has been mentioned in my personal Catholic back round.  A Jewish friend of mine has described a similar place (of his teachings) as respite, a place of healing, for souls to recover in, before moving on.  So, it was interesting to see the point of balance of this realm shifted to such a dark and heavy force. I found the parallels between this Purgatory and our own earth realm very interesting to wrestle with through out the film.  'Gabriel' presents the dark night of the human soul so very acutely with all of it's repulsive splendor even unto the Angels sent to deliver this place, and the inhabitants thereof, unto the hands of a light and benevolent God of which they represent.  This place, "...where even Angels fear to tread" depicts the thick, intense, struggles with the seven deadly sins of the flesh and the forces of light under fire by the fallen angels near complete in their control.  To see the Arch's (Archangels) succumb, one by one, to the starless landscape is of some comfort and yet abominable simultaneously.  For if the highest and strongest of the Angelic realm struggle so in the dark - then is it no wonder how the human spirit can also become so wretched?

'Gabriel' is no "chicken soup for soul", but certainly good food for thought.  It was unexpectedly well acted with a cast of unknowns battling light against dark in very effective cinematography noir, portraying gritty action sequences, interspersed with some very poignant insights gleaming from the shadows.  You may, or may not, feel delivered by this story, but I felt it certainly delivers.  This film was an unlikely, unexpected gem in the rough for me.  I purchased the DVD for myself and a few more for gifts.
