Depp plays the famous John Dillinger, if you haven't heard of him well that's sad because he helped the (what we know as) the FBI form and made the work bank robbery a common fad. He was an intelligent young man who started in Indian and moved cross country during the early 30's to make history. This film however does not play as a biography, rather a character summary. It gives us a look at Dillinger what he was like, as being in 2009 its hard to say, but Depp actually researched where he was born (Just a few miles from Depp's home town and found that he knew what Dillinger's accent would be like) After watching this movie I compared it to the real deal. In many books Micheal Man actually did make a film worth while historically (I have not seen any other Mann movies though) Mann doesn't go overboard this film actually feels REAL, like a Cinema movie, as if your in it so to speak. Trust me if you want a nice Gangster Movie, with by far the best actor in Hollywood Buy THIS! Also this movie shows another side of being a criminal its not always murder, sometimes its self defense.
