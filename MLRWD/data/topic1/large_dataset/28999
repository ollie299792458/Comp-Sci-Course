Right off the bat I knew I would like this book because of the logical layout its authors, Mark Driscoll and  Gerry Breshears, used.  Vintage Jesus is written like a catechism (i.e. question & answer).  This format makes it easy to follow the dialog and also makes this book a nice resource to come back to latter (I've already pulled it off the shelf a couple times to reference the responses to certain questions).

I also loved that this book didn't try to be something it's not.  There's not a lot of fluff in this book, it's simply questions about Jesus followed by concise, well thought-out answers.  It's a lot of red meat, but not so much that its confusing (the authors did a BIG favor to those of us who love to dig deeper though by including extensive footnotes for every argument).

Vintage Jesus hits on a wide range of issues like: Jesus' humanity, Jesus' Divinity, the Resurrection, why He should be worshiped, and Jesus' effect on history, which make it a great read for someone who's investigating the claims of Jesus to a seasoned minister, and all those in between.

I've already recommended this book to a couple of friends, and I'd recommend it to you as well.
