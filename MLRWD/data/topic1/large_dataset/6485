I found this version disappointing.  It's as though Robert Louis Stevenson's short story was turned into a novel by somebody other than him. In other words, I was left wondering whether the director ever read the story.  
First, one of the great things about the story is Stevenson's description of London.  A dark, Victorian, setting, generates a mood that helps create the drama.  In this production, mood is practically nonexistent.
Second, Hyde assaulting a young child on the sidewalk helps define Hyde's brand of evil early in the story. That scene does not appear in this movie, leaving the audience guessing at his character.  
Third, as others have noted, the women were miscast and Bergman's British accent made me wince.  
But the greatest flaw is the change, or rather, the betrayal of the ending. Stevenson's ending dramatizes Jekyl's despair over what he's unleashed - an increasingly important theme as the story progresses. This production ignores that entirely.
While a director should not feel bound by an author's every word, they should honor the spirit of the original, particularly when the original ranks as one of the best of its genre.  Here, there are a few dramnatic moments but, in general, it's a two dimensional movie that does a disservice to a great story.  
I give this 3 stars because of the cast, not because of the production.
