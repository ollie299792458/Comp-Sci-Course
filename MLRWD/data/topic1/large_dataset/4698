I find it very surprising that of all the lawyers praising this film, non of them know or if they know, never mention the fact that John Voelker AKA Robert Traver was a lawyer himself. As a matter of fact, he graduated from the University of Michigan law school supporting himself as a waiter through school, was prosecutor for Marquette County where this murder actually happened and he prosecuted this case. He went on to be appointed a Michigan supreme court justice in 1957 by  Govenor G. Mennen aka"Soapy" Williams and was re-elected. During that time he wrote the book "The Anatomy of a Murder" which was a feature  on the Book of the Month club selection. NO WONDER the guy knew how to write court room drama so realistically. This is a great film, its fun to see my mother's home town of Ishpeming which is where John Voelker actually lived, and cool to see the beautiful Marquette court house. But...I have to agree that Duke Ellington seems a little out of place if anyone is familiar with the demographics of the UP of Michigan. Love his music and him, though.
