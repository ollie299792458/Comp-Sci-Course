...and I don't even own a Blu Ray player yet! (That's how much faith I have in the UK product and as a Harry Potter fan!!!) I've never bought anything from Amazon UK either so this will be interesting.

UK's version is Region Free and doesn't have any 50i encoding so these UK discs will work on all US Blu Ray players (when I finally get one). This is how Warner Brothers makes all of it's Blu Rays.  If you are STILL not conviced this will work on your US blu ray, then you ought to go check out Amazon UKs site on the last Harry Potter Region Free Box Set (movies 1-6). Plenty of our USA compatriots had no issues with the films or bonus material, and reported great experiences buying from the UK. Also it comes with 3 extra discs that the US version doesn't have. And did I mention it's twice as cheap?! Yes, it came out to exactly 30 pounds, which is ~$48. Finally if you are a big Potter fan, youll have the irreplaceable value of telling your friends you bought Harry Potter from the UK. That's hardcore and I guarantee nobody will ever doubt your fanship after they know that.

Let me ask you something now, other than having to wait a couple more weeks for release,  why would you NOT get it from Amazon.co.uk? :D

By the way - Best Buy/Walmart's Black Friday Ads leaked today and I did not see a deal on Harry Potter Blu Ray box sets. Plus even if they were, I doubt they could beat $48. That's why I jumped on this deal today.

Hmmm....Now I need to buy a Blu Ray player and a new TV. LOL.
