This is one of those films where it is the main character - and the portrayal thereof - that makes it worth watching. In other words, the "story line" is of secondary importance (my favorite example of such being "Bullitt"). Wilson's laconic laid-back portrayal of a gypsy-like serial killer - the most difficult to catch, by the way - is spot on. This is no
Texas Chainsaw Massacre style of movie, even the violence is dispensed with via a poison that just puts the victim to sleep (eternally).

Beneath the calm demeanor, however, we are made privy to many of Vann's thoughts, which are as chilling in their sociopathic amorality as his exterior is bland.

The story takes on a more quaint dimension when Vann (the protagonist) finds his way into a small coastal town, where he rents a room from a somewhat dysfunctional middle-aged couple.
They, and his on-again off-again relationship with a girl working at the post office where he works, offer a degree of "color" to the film. Yeah,I have a couple of "problems" with
the film's story, including a couple of detectives that are figments of Vann's imagination, and a conclusion that has more than a couple of holes in it.

But it's Wilson that carries the film and makes it an enjoyable watch.
