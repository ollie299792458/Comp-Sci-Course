I enjoyed this phenomenal series. Loved the casting of the lead characters. The chemistry between them felt very real.

 L.A. private eye Mick St. John played by the gorgeous Alex O'Loughlin, has a secret. His bride, Coraline (Shannyn Sossamon), turned him into a vampire on their wedding night 60 years prior.
Now a vampire, he's living in a covert netherworld complicated by memories of his alluring ex-wife Coraline, and his relationship with a human, Beth Turner (Sophia Myles) whom he feels drawn to protect (since he saved her from his then vampire-wife, when she was a child). Now as an adult, Mick is in love with her. But no matter how he feels, Mick knows a vampire-human romance is eternally dangerous. What can he do about his very human feelings for her?
And so he struggles in the present day with his dealings with other vampires in the city and his love for the mortal Beth. It was wonderful viewing watching the love between them develop and unfold.
Then there's the charming, boyishly good-looking, happily amoral Josef Kolstan ( Jason Dohring), the undead finance honcho, with centuries of wisdom and his own sad past. Josef is the only person whom Mick trusts and values his friendship. Loved their at times off-beat dialogue.

A truly enjoyable series, a great pity that it ended after only one season.
 Oh well, at least they gave us a decent closure.
