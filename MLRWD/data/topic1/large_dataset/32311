I totally agree with the people who are peeved with PBS for cutting these episodes. It's shameful! Having said that, however, both Series 1 and Series 2 are worth watching (and owning) even in their edited forms. I, too, was (and remain) an avid fan of Inspector Morse. That series was the very best of what television has to offer and nothing will ever be able to take its place. However, since this isn't an "either or" situation, I highly recommend adding Inspector Lewis to your collection of British mysteries. It's thoroughly enjoyable to see that Lewis has come into his own--and that his nature has remained essentially the same as when he was Morse's young sidekick. Lewis isn't the type of fellow who changes much, because he's comfortable in his own skin. The rather enigmatic character of Hathaway is an excellent complement to the down-to-earth Lewis, but at the same time has wisely not been written to simply be a younger version of the complex Morse. The series hasn't entirely found its footing yet. Some of the plots are a tad convoluted--and every now and again Lewis makes an observation that doesn't seem quite "Lewis" - as we've come to know him. But...all in all the continuity is there, and there's rich soil in which each of the main characters, and the series, can grow. And of course, it is SO very good to be back in Oxford!
