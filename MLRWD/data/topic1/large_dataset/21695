Primal Fear is my most favorite thriller of all time and we have two wonderfully talented performers, Richard Gere and Edward Norton to thank for that. They really brought these characters to life big time on the screen. Originally they wanted Leonardo DiCaprio for the role of Aaron/Roy Stampler but apparently DiCaprio turned it down and Edward Norton took over the role and I must say he was the best!!! No other actor could have played that role to powerful perfection the way Norton did. Same goes for Richard Gere as big time defense attorney Martin Vail. He was the best for that role too. You could see the chemistry right there between Gere and Norton in that movie. They certainly were "A Great Team" as Roy puts it at the end of the movie. It certainly was him, boy! It certainly was him!!! And that is the first biggest twist of the movie, when we are lead to believe that Aaron has multiple personality disorder and has the Roy side to him that comes to his rescue whenever Aaron feels threatened. The biggest twist shocker is at the end when we find out that there never was an Aaron side to this criminal and that the Roy side of him existed all along and he faked the multiple personality disorder syndrome to get away with the crime by being declared insane. This was an absolute 10 star well done shocker! I own the movie after seeing it back in 1996 and have enjoyed watching it all these years and still look forward to watching it many more years to come. I hope Edward Norton will do another surprising psycho role like his Aaron Stampler character in the future. His stuttering and acting was indeed priceless and au natural in this flick. A highly recommended numero uno thriller.
