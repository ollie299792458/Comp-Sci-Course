WE are huge fans of Little einsteins in this household. I hate the baby einsteins DVD's with a passion but little einsteins is different! It introduces music, instruments, timbres, italian musical terminology, geography, science, art... All of which can be built upon by the discerning parent! I am a music graduate and taught music for 10 years and am very hard to please! This fantastic series brings the arts more mainstream! I love the way that the plot is not dumbed down and has language that is approachable and extends sufficiently. My 2 year old is a massive fan, has learnt the italian terms quickly just from the show and recognizes the pieces from the DVD. It's funny to hear a 2 year old asking asking to listen to Beethoven's 9th - and not just the parts that are known from the DVD! A great intro to 'classical' music if you haven't got your child hooked into it yet.

Do yourself a favour and leave this for a weekend only DVD - and grab an hour more in bed knowing that your child will be interested, learning lots of stuff and not seeing anything you'd really rather they didn't!
