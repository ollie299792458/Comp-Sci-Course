I have just read an article by someone on this website, who suggested burning every copy of this film, because it is 'dirty' and 'evil'. Firstly, burining this film would be like burning the Bible. And secondly, this person should stop being so incredibly sad. GET A LIFE, A PERSONALITY AND A SENSE OF HUMOUR WHILST YOUR AT IT! This is a fantastic film that should go down in history for it's exciting and witty respresentation of the story of Jesus. No-one should take any offense in the film and call it sacreligious as it is so funny and zany, it goes beyond the level at which you can take offense! I mean, come on. There is one scene in whcih the title role, Brian (played very well by Graham Chapman)is inadvertantly abducted by aliens and taken for a ride around the cloar system. Any one that can not see that this is just a film that runs along the same lines of the story of Jesus, and not one that it is a piss-take, should take a good hard look at themselves and all other films set in the Roman era. Are they blasthemous for being in the same time zone? If so, take a deep breath and 'look on the bright side of life!!!'

And for God's sake, I'm 13 and I can even spell and write better than the person that wrote the 'evil' review. Maybe that isn't such a coincidence!

Oh and also, I'd just like to add that over here in the U.K, this film won 'Best Comedy Film Ever' recently. So shove that up your pipes and smoke it all you people that said no-one likes it!
