Disappointed by Meet The Fokkers, we were at first hesitant to get Guess Who. After reading reviews here, I was even more prepared to find another trite, tasteless bit of film fluff.

I was pleasantly surprised to find this to be a very well done and touching film, in spite of its comedic overtones.

Bernie Mac gives one of his best performances yet, as the seemingly stern, overprotective and loving Percy Jones. In spite of his gruff and cranky surface, inside lies the soul of a man deeply committed to his home and family. His role plays off beautifully against Judith Scott as his wife. Although I felt hers was one of the weakest roles in the film, she managed to be the ideal foil for Percy.

Much has been said about the trite or superficial stereotypical racial handling of the subject matter in this film. I disagree. I found it to be one of the more realistic films of this type. Both Percy and Simon (Ashton Kutcher) create tensions relating to his being white in a very understated manner. The producers didn't go for the easy, but rather created a quieter tension, that leaves the viewer wondering how much is the dislike between Simon and Percy motivated by race or by other things entirely.

Simons fiancee, Zoe Saldana gives a fine sensitive performance as the daughter torn between needing her fathers approval and her deepening love for Simon. She's an actress to watch, I believe she has a great untapped range in her, that should lead to bigger, deeper roles.

This is a great film for whiling away a hot summers afternoon. The only problem I found with Guess Who, came near the end, where Percy's female in-laws, take the moral high ground and in what I feel was the only truly racist stereotyping of the entire film occurs.

I recommend this film for it's low key humor, thoughtful performances, and for the sheer pleasure of watching Bernie Mac hit his stride.
