SHE (1935) is a classic fantasy adventure that was produced by KING KONG creator Merian C. Cooper and was shot in black and white. It's unfortunate that the folks at Legend Films, who are distributing this new version (as well as other titles that are magically in color) feel they need to use Ray Harryhausen's name as much as they can in order to promote their colorized version. Though the film was originally "intended" on being shot in color, the bottom line is that it was not. This is ridiculous then that in this day and age-- after the failure of Ted Turner to colorize classic black and white films-- there are still people out there trying to make a buck by tampering with classic films in order to open up a new market. As Ray Harryhausen points out in one of the bonus interviews, there are, admittedly, some kids today who wouldn't even look at a black and white film as though this is sufficient justification to alter them. Fine. Let those kids grow up with their video games then but leave the other young movie fans to appreciate these films as they were originally filmed. Fortunately, the producers at Legend Films were smart enough to include the black and white version, as well as several worthwhile bonus features, such as an audio commentary by the great Ray Harryhausen & Mark Cotta Vaz, the author of the recent Merian Cooper biography. My advice is to watch the film in black and white first if you've never seen it and then watch it in color with the commentary track. The colorization still does not look natural and this is all done by the whim of a computer crew-- not by anyone connected to the original film. If you already have your Kino version, I wouldn't bother with this one.
