The long anticipated final installation of the "Sex" series is finally out on DVD.  I have watched season after season as my girls have lived through life's trials, tribulations and threesomes, and now that the end of Season 6 is here, all i want to do is go back to the beginning. You know, when Carrie had just met Big, Charlotte's had a love affair with the Rabbit, Miranda and her pre-Steve, untamed neurosis, and Samantha's relationship with the guy the size of a cocktail weinie. Does it get better than that?? I dont know what I'd do if the series wasnt out on DVD. And the Sixth Season DVD is even more full of fun than its predecessors. Extra features include ONE delated scene from each season (believe me, you'll be begging for more. I'm not sure why they didnt include more), each of the alternate endings that they decided not to use for the finale (each are good but I think they chose the perfect conclusion to "Sex"), and a panel discussion with Sarah Jessica and the writers. I was consumed for hours the day it arrived in the mail. I'll miss ya "Sex", but all good things must come to an end. After all, seasons change. . . People come into your life and people go. But it's comforting to know the ones you love are always in your heart. And if you're very lucky, a DVD player away!!
