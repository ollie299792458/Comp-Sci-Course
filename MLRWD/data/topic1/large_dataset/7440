Salomon Perel's war story is all the more unsettling for being true.Directed by the Polish Jewish director, Agnieszka Holland in 1991.Salomon(Solly)Perel(Marco Hofschneider) is a young German Jew,whose father is a Polish Jewish shop-keeper living in Germany with his family.There is a Pogrom against Jews on Kristallnacht,Solly and his brother Isaak,flee east into Poland.His circumcision is shown at the start of the film and will be the defining event in his identity.Solly gets split up from his brother and ends up in a Russian orphanage in Grodno,where he learns to be a fervent young Stalinist infatuated by his tutor.He becomes a model Komsomol and learns to speak Russian.He spouts indoctrination like `Religion is the opium of the masses'.

With the German invasion of Russia the school is uprooted and moves east,he gets separated and becomes a young German to the German soldiers,an interpreter who usefully speaks Russian for his unit,known as Joseph(Jupp) Peters,a favourite of the German soldiers.His ethnicity becomes known to a homosexual German soldier but he keeps it secret.He becomes an accidental hero after all his unit are killed and he surrenders to the Russians,only to find out that it's the Russians surrendering to him,with the German army behind him.The Commanding officer wants to adopt him and wants to send his `son' to one of the best German military schools,an elite youth academy.He falls for lovely,Jew-hating Aryan lass,Leni(Julie Delphy).But by this point the effort of hiding behind so many masks,not to mention hiding the most tangible physical evidence of his identity,is beginning to take its toll.

The film covers the absurdity of adapting to every changing event and yet the need to to survive at all costs. Ironies bite hard and occasional farcical moments add an unsettling edge to Perel's fortunes,e.g. in the class about Aryan racial superiority,when Solly is judged as not pure Aryan,but `Aryan enough'.This shows up racist pseudo-science.He also makes friends where he can,even with Germans who are anti-semitic.Perel is ambivalent towards all these people,Communist or Nazi,his chameleon-like skills bring him among.The film does not evade the horrors,but it alludes to the Holocaust only obliquely.There is no time  to reflect or moments of conscience. Perel's brief but chilling glimpse of the Lodz ghetto is all the grimmer for being set against his picaresque, spirited progress.The real Solly is shown at the end  as he is now in Israel,singing a song.This film covers a lot of history with a light touch.
