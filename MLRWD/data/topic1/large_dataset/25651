I had the honor of being a late comer to the Seagal DTV series.  I rented Out For A Kill, Submerged, and Today You Die all on the same day.  I'm still spitting the sour taste from my mouth.  I couldn't even get thru the first two and clenched my teeth to get thru Today You Die.  Why, oh why does he use stunt doubles for such simple things?  Were these snippets filmed after he left the set for the day so the double was used?  Even if he is getting too old for this stuff, anyone can choreograph these types of moves fairly convincingly.  Hell, The Duke and Bronson continued their own fistfights well into their 70's and even 80's for Bronson. (check out Hard Times to see Bronson in multiple extended and very convinving fistfights without the use of a stunt double and with his shirt off at the age of 54)

Now I own and can enjoy the likes of what some say are Seagals  worst - Fire Down Below, On Deadly Ground, and Half Past Dead - and I even found I found the Foriegner an okay watch, but Today You Die, Out for a Kill, and Submerged are altogether garbage and unwatchable. Not that Seagal is bad but everything else involved in these films absolutely stinks.  Maybe they're not paying the man enough to make a complete film?

Attn Hollywood:  Seagal has lots of fans and considering the trash that makes it to the theatre these days(The Core, The Cave, etc), lets give the man a good script and a budget worthy of a good film...
