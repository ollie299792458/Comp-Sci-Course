I was expecting a lot out of this movie when I went to see it and after seeing it, I was a little impressed, a little disappointed, but mostly impressed.

 "The Manchurian Candidate" is a difficult movie to remake and update and still make thrilling and relevant which is exactly what this one did and did quite well. Instead of the threat of communism, we have the all-too cozy alliance of politicians and multinational corporations (in this particular case, Manchurian Global).

 The acting was excellent. Denzel Washington plays the panicked Capt. Marco, Liev Schreiber is fantastic as Sgt. Raymond Shaw (he even looks like Laurence Harvey), and Meryl Streep steals the show as Raymond's evil mother.

 There are, however, some things which I disliked. First of all, Johnathan Demme implemented some images and extra blood and guts just to add to the shock value of the movie which was completely unnecessary (the Arab woman with her face tattooed holding the brain for instance...sort of laughable). Another thing was that the film was almost completely devoid of humor, which I found unbearable in some places. I understand that "The Manchurian Candidate" is not a comedy, but maybe a joke per hour just to lighten the mood?

 Also, I was just a little bit disappointed by the ending. It was a good ending, but the way it was dragged out didn't give it the same effect as the original.

 Overall, good movie, well worth seeing.
