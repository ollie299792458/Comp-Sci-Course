Ronin is a hidden gem. If you haven't seen it, you have missed one of the best-made movies of the last 20 years. It is an action movie with emotional power. It is a film of subtlety as well as heart-pounding, beautifully-filmed action. Courage, love, honesty, and loyalty in the midst of betrayal are all themes that the movie artfully explores and develops. Alert viewers will note how the theme of "waiting" is woven through the plot. The development of the relationships between the characters is wonderful to watch. The conversation between Sam and the Ronin model-maker is especially delightful, as they speak a "language" they both understand, but you don't. My only caveat are several instances of unnecessary profanity ("Unnecessary profanity" is, of course, redundant). I watch the movie with a ClearPlay DVD player and filter so the profanity is muted out when I watch it, but if you don't have a ClearPlay DVD machine, you will hear it. Also, there is considerable violence in certain scenes as "civilians" get caught in crossfire. I rate it only four stars for these reasons. Otherwise, good movie.
