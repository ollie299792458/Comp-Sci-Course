This movie is bound to be a timeless classic. The directing and acting were superb. The story probably reflects the most interesting time of Howard Hughes life and Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job portraying Mr Hughes. In fact I feel it is his best performance so far.

Hughes is one of the most interesting characters of the 20th century and in this movie you will find out why. He was an amazing man who made decisions quickly and decisively. I think you will learn a lot about the man and it will also leave you inspired to think bigger then you have been. One of my favorite lines from the movie is when Howard tells his engineer to stop thinking like an insect!

I own this one and have watched it numerous times sometimes by just fast forwarding it to my favoite parts. I was truly inspired by it and especially at the end when you see him as a young boy saying he was going to make the biggest movies and fly the fastest planes and become the richest man in the world. It just goes to show how a boy with some dreams can become a man with great realities.
