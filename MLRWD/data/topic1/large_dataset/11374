Ok, so you've read the scenario.  Let's get to the meat.  We have a very analytical "scientific" ghostbuster,his wife  and two very true mediums cast in this movie.  One fails to see, though each's  theory is  technically right, that it is not the whole. At one point it is extremely  ironic though Mr Scientist's  theory closely  coincides with the spirtual  "medium"'s he fails to see his mistep comes from his  unwillingness to see they are talking about the same thing, trapped in his  own verbage he could not cross the bridge of true understanding. The result  of such myopic thinking is of course death (sorry if I spoiled the  surprise). After seeing the movie it is interesting to note the spirit  protaganist suffered from an extreme sense of "less than" and  focused his life to feed, fan and blaze man's (and womans)negative  lasciviousness into a maelstrom of evil energy which survives physical  expiration.  Only when Roddy Mcdowell understands, gets mad and calls  Belasco to the carpet, that the truth set his spirit free.  And prays that  the good souls guide his way to peace.  This movie is truly fantastic,  believable with good acting and tone.  It is a leader amongst many due to  its tasteful, yet artfull way of dealing with the subject matter.  Any  student of life would appreciate this movie, and liken to the  "Poltergeist" it is entertaining for all.
