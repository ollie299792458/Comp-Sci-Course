I really appreciated and could relate to this movie. I adopted a dog from a pet orphanage whose male owner had died. She immediately became attached to my husband.  One day soon after I got her, my husband left for work and  she kept going in his closet, the shower, etc. looking for him.  I thought she was sick and I took her to the vet because she was shaking in fear.  Now I realize she was afraid my husband would never return.

This must have been how it was for Hachi.  Like Hachi, she tried to escape when we first got her, and still goes up to any man she meets thinking maybe it is her deceased prior owner.  She is now happy, but at around 4 in the afternoon, she waits by the utility room door for my husband to come home through the garage.

Too bad Hachi could not have found peace or closure. I guess the heartache was too much to bear and the love he had for his owner could have never been transferred to another.  It was his since of devotion and duty to wait for his owner's return.  This movie is priceless and the director captured the pain and heartbreak in the dog's expressions.
