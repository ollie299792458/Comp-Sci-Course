The first thing you will immediately notice about A Serbian Film is the quality of the production and acting. For a film of this nature, one would generally expect a B-movie atmosphere. This is simply not the case, and is perhaps the one major reason this film has intrigued me so much. The character development in the early portion of the film was also surprisingly well done, and was very convincing to boot. It has been a long while since I've seen a good horror film that allowed me to feel something for the characters on screen. The family is relatively normal, albeit Milos' taboo job of being a porn star.

As far as porn is concerned, we see very little gratuity in this area. Certainly there is nudity, but it is mostly done in a tasteful fashion. It is a paradox of some sort. To see this piece of cinema that undoubtedly falls under the moniker of "torture porn," yet so much is held back. Indeed, the gore and the themes presented are taboo and will not appeal to everyone. The film is genuinely intense. However, I did not feel that the gore or the nudity itself was the reason why this film was intense. While there are a few scenes that will stick in mind for a long time, the overall somber atmosphere and psychological torture you (as the viewer) will undergo is what I found most gripping.

When it comes to adult themes, this film holds nothing back. We see rape, child rape, genital torture, and similar things. Still, so little is shown. But, what will stick with you is what is said. The final words in the film change the dynamic of the movie, make it far more disturbing, and ultimately cause this film to be one of my favorites in the horror/thriller genre.

So, in conclusion, if you can stomach a good amount of gore, don't mind gratuitous nudity, and are interested in seeing a movie explore such adult themes, you will enjoy this for sure.
