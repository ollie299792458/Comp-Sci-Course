I saw this on tv back in the 60s, maybe early 70s, as a teen, young adult. I remembered that it was about a bunch of old guys in suits who rob a bank then have a falling out. Nothing much.

Since I've now been looking into Film Noir and re-discovering alot of gems, I thought I'd give this one another look, especially since it was put out by MGM and wasn't a public domain cheap job (hint...ALPHA).

My God, what a great movie, delivering just like the dvd cover states, "A Tough and Taught drama, bristling with Suspense!". And the MGM dvd is a beautiful print, crisp and sharp, making for me a viewing experience akin to sitting in a theater in 1952. And how refreshing seeing REAL-TIME action from real men instead of some lame preppy-boy backflipping while firing pistols in both hands during a 30-story fall from some corporate building in Computer City.

I was really amazed at just how good this little Noir crime thriller actually was! The acting, cinematography, direction, story-line, all top-notch. And for 3 henchmen we get Neville Brand, Lee Van Cleef and Jack Elam all in the same movie! It doesn't get any better than that!

...I wasn't expecting much and it floored me.
They often say that you remember movies viewed in your youth with a certain fondness that rapidly dissolves into reality when rewatching that same film many years later. Well, the exact opposite is the case here. As an impressionable lad KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL left no enduring mark on my psyche. Viewing it many years later left me stunned that such a great B-film could be made in 1952, looking so fresh and "new", especially when compared against the current video-game action crap that we're forced to digest today.

Buy this film, the MGM dvd only.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
