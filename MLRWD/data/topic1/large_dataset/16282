(Sorry if it seems boring at first, but don't worry, I get to the point.)
 I remember the first time I saw this movie. It was sitting on our video shelf upstairs, and, despite having this movie for years, I had never watched it. My sister was babysitting me(she had moved out of the house) and it was a special time for both of us. We wanted to watch a movie, and  she brought "Aladdin" downstairs. I informed her that I had never seen this movie, before, and that I wasn't sure that I would like it. My sister told me that this was a good movie, so I agreed.
 Boy, am I glad that I did! From the first scene(with the merchant displaying his products), I knew I would enjoy "Aladdin". To this day it is one of my favorite movies of all time(and I'm a teenager!). Why do I like it so much? Three reasons:
1) The plot. Even as a kid, I loved the romance, laughed at  the jokes(excluding some of the many references by Genie, of course), and experienced the emotions of the scenes as the crew intended.
2) The voices. The characters just seem so real! From The Sultan- a joyful, peppy, and funny little fellow- to Jafar- who doesn't seem as real as the others, but, I admit, the way he is presented in this movie is kind of hard to work with. I absolutely LOVE the voices! They are so good at portraying the characters!
3) The soundtrack. I am completely in love with the soundtrack(I have the original CD and the Spanish version of it. Can you tell I'm obsessed?). Kudos to Lea Salonga and Brad Kane. "A Whole New World" is by far the best Disney vocal song EVER when it comes to romance(in my humble opinion).
 If you have never seen this movie before, please do. You're really missing out.
