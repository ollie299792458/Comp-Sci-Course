I almost gave the film 4 stars simply because I wanted more than 81 minutes.  Mr. Garrison's line about why he doesn't trust women with PMS had me rolling on the floor. 
Some people have complained about the decision  to make this film into a musical, but I think that it was a great idea on  Parker and Stone's part.  The songs are very catchy, and I often find  myself singing them in my head.  I even went so far as to buy the  soundtrack. 
As far as the quality of the DVD goes, there are 3  theatrical trailers.  I wish that there had been more than that-such as a  director's commentary or even better, deleted scenes which were taken out  in order to acquire an R rating.  The fact that these special features were  not included does not surprise me-Paramount made this DVD and so far, their  DVD's have been real letdowns in terms of special features.  
Warning:  DO NOT allow children under 17 (perhaps even that is too young) to view  this film.  There is no way in the world that this film can ever be edited  down to be shown on network television-the profanity is staggering.  Now,  if only the TV series could return to being as funny as this movie was.  Some of the recent episodes have been awful (ex:the meteor shower episodes,  the Korn episode). I don't know what will become of the series now that the  woman who did all of the female voices recently killed herself.
