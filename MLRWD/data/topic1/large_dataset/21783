And I'm not sure why anyone would say different.  This movie is funny throughout every single scene.  Given the title, you shouldn't expect some finite time travel physics like Terminator or Back to the Future.  It was a movie that you could laugh and follow along with as easily as any other great comedy.  The combo platter of comedians made terrific chemistry.  This movie was destined to be a horrible afterthought of the Hangover, but instead it standed on it's own two feet and differentiated from that film by being its own hilarious animal.

The only minor complaint I have is the disc's lack of special features.  It's not something I demand more of usually, when it comes to comedies.  However, there was close to nothing here.  For most blu-ray customers, this should not be a problem though.

In a world filled with horrible comedies, this one proves that America still has creative funny juice in it.  It has a lot of playability due to its enormous amount of jokes.  Don't listen to the haters, Hot Tub Time Machine is the bee's knees.
