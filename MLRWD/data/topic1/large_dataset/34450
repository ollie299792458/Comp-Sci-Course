Robocop was one of the two mega-science fiction movies to hit theaters in 1987. The other was Arnold Scharzenegger's Predator. Predator was expected to be a big hit before it was even released, while Robocop became a suprise hit at the box office. In addition, Robocop's fame transcended move theaters, and soon Robocop served as the inspiration for toy action figures, an arcade game, a Nintendo Entertainment System game, and a pinball machine.

The original Robocop is easily one of the top science fiction films of the 1980s. The DVD edition, unfortunately, does not live up to all it could. The only extras are three trailers. It would have been nice to see some footage on the creation of Robocop's well done special effects, such as the designing and creation of ED-209. Also, the DVD transfer does not have the greatest picture quality. The picture quality seems more along the lines of VHS than DVD.

Nevertheless, Robocop succeeds in large part due to its adrenaline-pumping action and shoot outs. Robocop's haunting memories of the life of a murdered Detroit police officer, Murphy, add some nice humanity and drama to the intense action. I love the Robocop theme music, which plays whenever the cyborg is crusing the streets of Detroit in his patrol car.
