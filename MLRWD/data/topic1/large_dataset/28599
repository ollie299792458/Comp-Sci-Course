It is almost a shame that they decided to title this film "House of Wax," for it caused many, like myself, to see it in terms of the 1953 "House of Wax," Andre de Toth's 3D Magnum Opus. Credit is given to Charles Belden, author of "Mystery of the Wax Museum," the 1933 film that both "Houses" are based upon, which both surprised and pleased me. The script follows a well-worn path, first beaten down by "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," but is given new life by the lively direction of Jaume Collet-Serra and Stephen Windon's slick cinematogaphy. The performances are solid, for the most part, with Elisha Cuthbert stalwartly working amid gooey wax and animal carcasses. Brian Van Holt does double duty as the twins Bo & Vincent--but which one is the crazy one? Jared Padalecki endures the most uncomfortable scene (and makeup) in the film; I have a feeling that if he was in the position he is in now in film, he might have gotten a meatier role. Chad Michael Murray makes a good latter day Steve McQueen and although most people have jockeyed for first position to badmouth Paris Hilton, she does fine for the part she was given to play. The real star is Graham "Grace" Walker's wonderful production design of the creepy little town and in the center of it all the House of (literally) Wax. Another high point is John Ottman's evocative score, which is often spoiled by the overlapping of some fairly obnoxious modern "music." All in all, a fun and appropriately icky horror film for Our Modern Audiences.
