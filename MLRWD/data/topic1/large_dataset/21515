first and foremost i was very satisfied with this movie, normally movies based on reality dont always show up right to me. im a movie guy! i love good movies! i seek out good movies. the acting in some wayz was cheezy and time seemed to fly by thoughout the movie, ha well what do you expect, your not looking for a 127 hour movie! in the time to illustrate a mans experience in this movie was good enough for me! it was moving, illustrative, encouraging, adventurous, inspiring. IT'S A GOOD ONE! WATCH IT. but only if your into movies. i'm not a book reader, and of course there will be missing words from a book. but as a movie! it's great.
 as far as the environment and setting. it really illustrates mans way of thinking. like all man before, explorers, adventurest, scholars scientist! is to conquer everything... i grew up in the terrain such az this, in northern arizona. a native american growing up on the navajo reservation. i was taught growing up to live in HARMONY. "WALK IN BEAUTY" as the navajo tribe say it. meaning to walk in harmony. man cannot conquer the land or the sea. but to live in harmony they can. respect mother earth, because she has provided all our needs.
 well that's what stood out to me, was we can enjoy life, enjoy the fruits this land has to offer with respect. but to become over our heads and think we are the top of the world. one small step, and you slip and roll back down the mountain! haha.
