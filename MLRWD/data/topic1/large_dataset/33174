Like Roman Polanski's "The Ghost Writer," this British show is a spy-thriller railing against the U.S. ties to the British government.  "Page Eight" also has a sinister Tony Blair surrogate.  The similarity between the two films is so great that even most of the same locations were used - including a roadside diner (probably in Germany).  They were probably filmed by  the same people, at the same time, for the same political purposes.

Despite all of these cookie-cutter similarites, "Page Eight" is somewhat subtler, and therefore more tolerable.  The cast is also stronger; for example, Ralph Fiennes replaces Pierce Brosnan as the evil-Blair.

Besides the U.S., this British production also targets Israel; a sub-plot involves Israeli culpability for the cold-blooded murder of a Palestinian-British woman's brother.

The silliest aspect of both films is the British self-portrayal of duped innocence.  Battalions of British writers have made a good living by writing espionage novels about the moral compromises inherent in intelligence work (Le Carre inevitably comes to mind).  Here, we are supposed to believe that the British are dragged into a quagmire of American brutality, torture and mayhem, only to finally realize - when it is far too late - that perhaps they should have held back.  Amusing stuff coming from the country that invented the term "concentration camp."  Thanks, Lord Kirchener.
