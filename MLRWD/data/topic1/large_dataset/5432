I have watched this movie numerous times.  Owen Wilson is mesmerizing in it.  Although his character is a serial killer, he is not shown to be creatively violent the way that most movies (such as The Bone Collector) do.  He is the kind of nice guy that you want to meet, like when you do meet them, and never would suspect that they kill people they don't even know.  The voice-over by Wilson's character gives you an idea that although he doesn't really seem to want to kill, and certainly doesn't want to kill violently, he still has the compulsion to kill.  In the film, he finally breaks his own rule about only killing strangers, but he does it believing that he is doing the victim a favor.  I never get tired of this movie, and it shows Wilson's dramatic skills, as pretty much all the other movies I have seen of his have been comedies (Zoolander, Shangai Noon, Night at the Museum, among others).  I highly recommend this movie to those who like a thoughtful character study.  Do not recommend to people expecting a highly charged thriller with a violent serial killer whose motives are never explained.  Also, Janeane Garofalo plays a serious character (she was hilarious in Mystery Men, with Owen Wilson's buddy, Ben Stiller), and Dwight Yoakem has done some good work in terrific movies like Sling Blade and Red Rock West.
