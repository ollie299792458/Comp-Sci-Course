I have already watched the entire DVD set and extras.  I thoroughly loved it and was left wishing they'd made more episodes.  Too bad the "lessons"/"morals" had been omitted from the master episodes in the 1990s.  I really missed those tagged at the end of every episode.  On the extras, however, there are a few gleaned from video transfers.

The stories are surprisingly relevant and I was happy to get my 6 year old niece into Isis.  She loved it!  It's just long enough to develop a plot, but not too long to bore kids.

I found myself surpised at how many episodes I remembered from childhood.  It was just great and I wholeheartedly recommend the set.

One teensy thing: I was really wishing Joanna Cameron was interviewed for the DVD extras, but oh well. *shrug*  The other principal actors are there.

Now, if we could just get Shazam! released, we'd have ALL the Isis-containing live action episodes made by Filmation, since Isis guest starred on Shazam! several times.
