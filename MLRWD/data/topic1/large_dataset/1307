This is far from Jackie Chan's best film, however it still contains some great scenes and I would definately recommend to any true Chan fan.  First off I have to applaud Columbia Tristar for including the Cantinese language  option on the DVD.  I have been waiting for someone to do this for a long  time.  Much of Jackie's redubbed Hong Kong movies have lost something in  the translation to English.  I would recommend that anyone who wants to  view movies like First Strike, Operation Condor and Police Story 1 and 2 as  they were originally intended should track down the Cantonese versions.  Anyway, one of the best things about Gorgeous is the opportunity to see  Jackie Chan in a new and different role as a business man.  I applaud his  attempts to continually try different roles.  He displays an often unseen  confidence in this role.  I really love his English language films like Who  Am I?, Mr Nice Guy and Shanghai Noon.  However we all have to admit that  his English is none to good and this will definately hinder him at times.  The action scenes in Gorgeous are top notch and Brad Allen, his nemesis in  the movies two outsatnding fights, is absolutely incredible.  Jackie Chan  may be approaching 50, however he still proves that he can still  choreograph the best fights in the business.  The movie is somewhat bogged  down by 2-3 overly silly scenes, however this is a part of Jackie Chan's  persona.  Not his best film, however it is one that no Chan fan should  miss.
