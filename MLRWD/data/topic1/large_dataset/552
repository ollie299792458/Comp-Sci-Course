A Christmas Story is about a young boy named Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) and his dream of owning a Red Rider BB gun.  Ralphie decides to ask for his dream prize for Christmas only to hear his mother, teacher, and even Santa Claus give him the typical adult response, "you'll shoot your eye out".  The movie focuses on Ralpie's life and his endless scemes to win his coveted prize.  The setting takes place in the early 1940s in a middle class, midwestern small town.  The movie does a wonderful job of telling the story from a child's point of view all the way down to his daydreaming and scemes.  The subplots like the "Scott Fargus Affair", and the "major award" that Ralpie's father (Darren McGavin) wins in a silly crossword puzzle contest only add to the humor and charm of this holiday classic.  Melinda Dillon plays Ralpie's stay-at-home mother, and Ian Petrella plays Ralphie's irritating baby brother.
If you are looking for a funny and charming trip down memory lane then this movie is a  must see.  It will take you back to the innocence of your childhood when you and all of your friends still believed in Santa Claus and the true magic of Christmas.  This movie was written primarily for adult viewers because of the nostalgic feel, but can be enjoyed by people of all ages.  For the past several years, the TNT network has run this movie 24 hours nonstop on Christmas eve and Christmas day.  However, I would strongly suggest buying it and putting right next to the other Christmas classics in your collection.
