I can't believe I'm saying this but this is the best animated movie Marvel has done so far! And believe me, when I first saw the trailer and read the premise I did not like it.  I think what scared me about this one is that after several offerings from Marvel animated movies (some ok, some decent, and some great), suddenly we're getting what seemed like a "kid-friendly" movie which to me completely went against the point of doing these direct-to-DVD movies.  Kid friendly Marvel stuff should be left for regular T.V.  Well I'm happy to say I was wrong about this one.  I think the fact that it's an original story is where its strength lies.  First off, the setup for the story is well executed.  Ultron defeats all the original Avengers and Tony Stark escapes with their offspring.  Another strength is the characters.  James Rodgers, the son of Captain America and Black Widow, is first portrayed as a slacker so it's cool to see his father come out in him as things progress.  Torunn is the daughter of Thor and I think she may be my favorite character.  Plus she has my favorite scene in the movie where she prays to her dad and the way he `answers' her is awesome!  Azari is the son of Black Panther and Storm (not a spoiler, they're now married in the comics).  He's kind of the level headed one and it's cool to see the powers of his parents combined in him. Pym, the son of Wasp and Giant Man, was the only one I really didn't like because he's basically the annoying one of the bunch.  And Francis Barton is the son of Hawkeye and he's pretty much identical to his dad.  They really portray Ultron as a real threat here and they make me believe that he could actually defeat all the Avengers.  We also get some action from an aged Hulk and it's great to see him let loose.  I wouldn't be surprised if Marvel includes these characters into their comic continuity somehow because they've got some really great material here.  Highly recommend checking this out.
