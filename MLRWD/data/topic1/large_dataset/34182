You have to be a genius to be this silly.  Monty Python has done a fantastic amount of research into Jewish history and the birth of Christianity to make a total mockery of the hypocrisy found in people who  claim to practice these religions.  As a deeply spiritual man, I found this  film completely unoffensive.  This film doesn't poke fun at those who are a  part of their religion because of an informed, knowledgeable decision, but  rather at those who believe what they believe despite all evidence to the  contrary and can't offer any valid explanation for it.  Most people have  probably been embarassed by people of that sort even in there own religion.  Anybody who thinks that Monty Python's sense of humor is stupid isn't  smart enough to understand the vast amount of research they must have done  to turn verifiable history into such a ridiculous commentary on unchanging  human behaviour.  From the political issue made out of Stan's irrational  desire to be a woman so he could have babys (You haven't got a womb.  Where's the fetus going to gestate?  You gonna put it in a box?) to the  embarrasing meeting where the PFJ finds out that maybe the Romans aren't so  bad (Okay, they did provide the roads, the aqueduct, public sanitation,  education, the wine, etc.) to Pontius Pilate's speech impedement (Who do  you want weleased?  And no more Wudolph the Wed-nosed Weindeer.) followed  by his best friend's linguistic problems (Thampthon of Thithily the  Thaduthee thtrangler wanted for theveral theditious crimeth) to the finale  of optomistics on crosses singing "Always look on the bright side of  life."  If you don't get this epic joke and at least appreciate some  of what they deleted to keep the plot tight (DVD--Criterion Edition only) I  feel sorry for you.  But I'm not your judge.  Review this film for  yourself.
