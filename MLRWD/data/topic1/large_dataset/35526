Alot of the time people tend to turn their nose down when it comes to gay movies. Whether because they just don't like them, they contain too much sex or because the ones they have seen, are so poorly written that it insults the very definition of the words movie and writing.

Were The World Mine is none of the above, except for the gay movie part. Instead it's one of the few gay movies that is well written. And not only that but is also very beautiful in terms of style and song. And yes, while the word song might also make you second guess if it's a good movie or not, here it's actually a good thing because the actors involved are capable of it and know how to get all the emotions out through it. I could listen to the songs alone all day. The dancing? well the few dance scenes are pretty funny but it doesn't matter that much because it is a good movie.

A fun movie that relies on the spoken word to get it's romance across instead of graphic sex, I found it to be quite sweet and something that I would tell everyone to see should they ask what's worth watching.

The rest of the plot well, so many ppl reviewing it have already told you that so I don't feel the need to repeat it.
