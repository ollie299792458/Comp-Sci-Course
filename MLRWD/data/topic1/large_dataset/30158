A lot of people have criticized this movie due to it's historical innacuracies.  I am curious as to whether or not they had the same reaction to "Amadeus" (which is also based on a grand premise that has been dismissed by most historians.)  Still not satisfied?  Okay then, how about this... no one billed this film as a documentary.  Like "Amadeus" it uses well known facts to weave a fantasy.  If the producers are to be criticized, then let us now and forever more abandon the realm of historical fiction, and declare the area off-limits.  Hollywood will surely not comply.  Beethoven's personality itself was the stuff of rumor and legend, and many of us (myself included) place him on a gilded throne, and are unwilling to accept a portrayal of him that is (as is presented in this film) not without his serious human flaws. (If you think the guy didn't have issues, check out the biography by Maynard Solomon.) We want to LIKE Beethoven, and many scenes in this movie make it hard for us to sympathize with him.  Our hero brought low... oh the horror. I think this film has taken him from the ivory tower and laid him out like a tragic Greek hero, who's passions become the source of his undoing.  Yes, it was hard to watch.  I do not know If I could watch it again, but I appreciate it.  It is a fictional tale meant to give a more human interpretation of a man we hold in pristine glory.  That's it.... an interpretation.  Don't buy it if you don't want to.  Keep in mind, though, that none of us knew the Maestro personally.
