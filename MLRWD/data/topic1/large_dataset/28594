I have been a huge Batman fan for over 35 years. Have collected many comic books, own different videos including the 1943 & 1949 movie serials. This version of the Dark Knight was the most eagerly anticipated version in years. I enjoyed the movie so much that I saw it twice in the theater. The only thing that I was a little disappointed was with how Bruce Wayne became Batman when his parents were murdered. The original version in the comics says that they were killed by Joe Chill, a lowly thief. In the movie version, the killer was a young Jack Napier who later became the Joker. I understand why the producers made this change. So that Batman could have a double motive to kill the Joker. The Joker's origin was changed also. In the comics he was first The Red Hood who later fell into the vat of chemicals & changed into the Joker. 
Except for those 2 changes, the movie was basically the same as in the comics. The costume was incredible & so was the Batmobile.
The 3 sequels later on were more or less okay. Only Batman & Robin was bad. It looked like the 1966 TV series. BIG MISTAKE.
I can't wait for the next one. Hope this review helped.
