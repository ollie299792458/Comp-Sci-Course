I've always enjoyed westerns. As a younger kid I almost grew up on John Wayne. So, when I saw this movie for the first time I was quite surprised.  Not that John Wayne isn't great. The Searchers and The Man Who Shot Liberty  Valance are both fantastic films and 2 of my all time favorites. However,  the level of violence in this movie immediately set it apart. The shootouts  are spectacular and have influenced virtually all of today's action films,  especially those by directors such as John Woo. Of course, this wasn't the  main point of the film, but merely a technical flourish, and it's a shame  it's the aspect of the movie that's most remembered. The story is fairly  simple but highly moving. There's a large amount of symbolism and the movie  has a very melancholy feel to it. All in all, it's fantastic. The acting is  stupendously done by an unbelievable cast, the script is quite good, the  directing, editing, and cinematography all are amazing and primerally what  made the movie famous/infamous. Highly recommended. Buy it or at least see  it, but make sure it's the director's cut.
