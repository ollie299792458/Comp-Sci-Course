I understand that this piece was only 45 minutes, and did not have the luxury of space as a series would, but it was still one of the worst titles I have ever seen.

So you have a female vampire named Saya, who is supposed to be the last vampire left in the world.  She knows how to fight using a samurai sword, and she has about as much emotion as a stone.  There are so many holes in this story that I don't know where to begin.  For one thing, why is it that Saya is the last Vampire?  What happened to the others?  Where did she come from?  Why is she working with the government of police or whatever?  What is she searching for?  What is her purpose?

There is no character development whatsoever.  If there was at least a little, then Blood would have been vastly improved.  I do not think that its length is the disadvantage here.  I think it is just bad writing involving lack of a plot and character development.  The animation was great.  I haven't seen much out there like it, but that is the only good thing about this piece.
