I would have given this movie 38 stars if I could. This is not just the greatest movie ever made, it's a pretty safe bet that it's the greatest movie that ever will be made, since the talent quotient of this country, and this planet for that matter, has been on a downward spiral since the 1970s.  There are so many amazing things about this movie they can't be listed here; the acting, the writing, the casting, the music.  The movie is almost a word-for-word portrayal of the book.  Probably never has a movie stayed so true to the book, which was once called "the largest selling fiction book in the history of publishing." Maybe Harry Potter has surpassed The Godfather book in sales, but while the literary community sits around waiting for someone to write 'the great American novel,' they don't realize it has already been written, and it was called "The Godfather."  Like the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, Einstein's Relativity Theory and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, "The Godfather" is one of the high points of human existence, having earned its way into that exalted realm in which perfection is the MINIMUM standard.
