According to the commentary track included with this DVD, David Byrne may be considered to be the central character in this Talking Heads concert documentary.  In the course of the film's 90 minute duration, he is transformed as "a stiff white guy who sheds his inhibitions, gets loose and lets go.  He is both changed by the music and set free."

The concert starts on a bare 60 by 40 foot stage with a solo performance of "Psycho Killer" and then slowly adds both equipment and musicians during the first five songs.  By the sixth song, "Burning Down the House", nine musicians are present and will remain fully engaged for the next 10 tracks. Three additional tracks are included on the DVD as a bonus.

Seven cameras were used to record the performance, with much of the footage being shot from the perspective of the audience. Indeed, the viewer of the documentary is made to feel that they are actually witnessing a live event.  The director takes great pains to record the artists not just as musicians, but also as "characters" with their own individual performance personalities.

The stage is lit solely by white lighting, with both the type and positioning of the lights permitting an amazing visual variation.  Backlit slide photography of both text and representational images are sometimes used in the stage design as well.

The title, "Stop Making Sense", refers to David Byrne's approach to writing song lyrics during the early 1980's. His lyrics are often irrational and illogical, not making sense from one line to the next, yet they still tend to remain both intuitive and emotionally involving.

"Stop Making Sense" is resplendent in its entertaining divergence from the commonplace.  Watch, listen and be moved by its wonderfully liberating creative energy!
