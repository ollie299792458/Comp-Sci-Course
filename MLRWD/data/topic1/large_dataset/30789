Not since the brilliant Howard Ashman and 'Aladdin' has Disney managed to create a perfect movie. Fifteen years later Ashman's partner Alan Menken has found a new lyricist equal to the task, in Stephen Schwartz. This wonderful movie is guaranteed to delight children, and there's plenty for adults as well. Everyone will respond to 'Happy Working Song', a hilarious and magical reworking of 'A Spoonful of Sugar', and also 'That's How You Know', the first fully-successful ensemble performance since, perhaps, 'Sound of Music'.
For me, the greatest thing about all great Disneys is the way they challenge people to think about moral questions, without ever being preachy. This film is firmly in that tradition. It focuses on the question of cynicism, plausibly placing a completely uncynical person into the cynical, worldly world of New York City. Her journey is from a girlish perception of love to a womanly appreciation including sexual attraction, but she never moves an inch in terms of cynicism, despite everything swirling around her. Rather, hers is the victory as, one after the other, the various people she meets get drawn towards her world-view.
The film explores a second theme, having a lot of fun with the idea of people of different paradigms coming together. The film explores this in terms of inclusiveness and understanding, even reaching across sexual stereotypes in the big ensemble number (starting with the idea of old people falling in love, and taking it from there).
Great entertainment for all. I hope that more adults look beyond prejudice and give this film the chance it deserves, to delight and enlighten. It bears many repeated viewings.
