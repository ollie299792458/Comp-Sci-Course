I have been waiting to see Journey for 23 years - seeing as I live in England and, sadly, the band's tours never reach Europe .
Well, at last the wait is over, even though I've now only seen them on DVD rather than in the flesh. But what a DVD!
The sharpest picture I have seen on any DVD, a superb sound (I'm talking the stereo version, I haven't got surround) and a totally stunning performance.
Steve Augeri is every bit as good at singing "Perry's songs" as his performance on the Arrival CD suggests and Neal Schon's guitar playing in particular is inspirational.  The band really look like their enjoying their performance and it's contagious.
If, like me, you are considering ordering this Region 1 disc from outside the States I say "Do It Now!" My copy from Amazon arrived in England in 11 days, as promised.
I have only a few minor quibbles, which in no way detract from the 5-star status:
1. The cameras concentrate a little too much on the audience at times.
2. It would have been nice to have had either an interview with the band or a documentary on the tour and how the 'new Journey' came about, the disc is a little light on extra features.
But that's it. This disc rocks!
