"Pretty Woman" is one of my all-time favorite movies, even if it is completely unrealistic, corny, and unbelievable.  But the beauty of that movie is that the chemistry between Julia Roberts and Richard Gere made you  want to believe.  "Runaway Bride" was a chance to see these two  actors together again, and once again I enjoyed their chemistry on-screen.  If anything, I liked Gere's character more because he was more noticeably  flawed.  However, lightning doesn't strike twice and the movie itself just  doesn't catch you and pull you in like "Pretty Woman" does.  It  was enjoyable enough but I can't imagine myself watching it over and over  again like I have with their first effort.  That said, I enjoyed several  other performances in the movie as well, such as Joan Cusack (a real  scene-stealer), Hector Elizondo (so great in "Pretty Woman", he  was sadly underused here), and Rita Wilson.  If you're going to choose a  movie because you're a Julia Roberts fan, you might prefer "Notting  Hill", her other effort last summer, or better yet go see "Erin  Brockovich" in the theaters.
