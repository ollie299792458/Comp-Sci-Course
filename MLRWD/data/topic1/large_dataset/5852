GREAT film. The perfect blend of humor, bullets, and dark realism to make this one of the films that I am proud to put on my list of favorites. The second in the lineup of Tarrantino's shocking and cooly hip films (the first being Reservoir Dogs, which I have also reviewed) is the absolute best. Three stories that are played in no particular order and somehow link together are what make up Pulp Fiction. The first story is about a hitman, a hitman's wife, a drug dealer, and one crazy night (I am not going to give too much away!). In the second, the subject is a boxer, a crime boss, a gold watch, and a pawn shop keeper. And finally, the third, is about two hitmen, a gun, a car, brains, and a paranoid suburban guy, who somehow has a problem with storing a headless body in his garage. I know that I did not go into much detail, but I want you to enjoy the twists, turns, and suprises that make up this great movie. Not for the squeamish or easily disturbed. A rough film, no question about it, but still one of the best in history. This is one of those movies that I would give 6 stars if I could.
