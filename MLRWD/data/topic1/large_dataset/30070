One of Demi Mooore's better performances and you can always be assured of a brilliantly performed character from Gary Oldman.  From a very small part as a taxi driver in Bullet to major parts in the Godfather films, Robert Duvall should have been seen more in The Scarlet Letter as he is such a superb actor.

I quite often look at who is doing the music score for a film.  If it is the like of John Barry, Jerry Goldsmith or James Horner you know it is one to see and even add to the collection.  In this case it is the late and great JOHN BARRY.  He should have been nominated and received yet another Academy for this score.  He was able to make the film speak it's story line via music and give the beauty of the British Columbia locations the correct interpolation with the dramatics of the script.

I feel the only fault was that the picture was not presented in the WidescreeN (2.40.1) format.

Out of 5 stars I give THE SCARLET LETTER a big 4 and with sincere thanks to Amazon for making it available to me.
