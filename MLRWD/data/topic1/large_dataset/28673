I originally saw Magnum Force in the theatres and I remember the whole audience applauding after the title sequence. I knew I was in for a good movie. For starters, it's got he highest body count of all the Dirty Harry movies, and don't forget to check out a young Suzanne Somers getting an engagement ring and then taking her top off at the pool party scene. What's not to like?

Visually, it really isn't as artistic a film as the original Dirty Harry, for instance there isn't all the Christian imagery suggesting Harry as San Francisco's avenging angel. This movie is a sequel, but it's top-notch and has a really great script. Michael Cimino went on to make The Deer Hunter (and then kill United Artists with Heaven's Gate)  I liked Lalo Schaffrin's score for this film better, it's a little more cohesive and powerful, but still follows the mold set-up with Dirty Harry.

I have no problems with the quality of the picture or sound on the Blu-ray disk, it's just like watching it in the theatre.  If you like cop flicks or action flicks you need to add this to your collection.  So many movies "borrowed" from the Dirty Harry movies over the years, these movies are a must now that they have been restored.
