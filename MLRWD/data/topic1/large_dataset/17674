Rory O'Shea moves from group home to group home rebelling against authority and rebelling against his handicap. All he has ever wanted is to be treated like everyone else. And when he comes to his latest group home, he meets another resident named Michael, who knows he will never been treated like everyone else. But then a strange thing happens when Rory shows Michael that they need not blindly accept their fates and their wheelchairs and teaches him how to live.

If, you hadn't heard of Rory O'Shea Was Here, you now have. And if it has been sitting in your queue, wait no longer. This movie has the right amount of creativity, intelligent writing, wit and heartbreak (almost a little bit modern-day <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790732181">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</a>). Like I did, hopefully you will care about Rory and Michael; you will be happy when they laugh and you will even be mad at Rory if you feel he's pushing Michael too far. I like a movie that can keep me engaged and gets me invested in the lives of its characters. I liked Rory O'Shea Was Here a lot.
