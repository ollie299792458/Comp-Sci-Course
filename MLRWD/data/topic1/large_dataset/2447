In my eleventh grade Morality class, our teacher made us view The Long Walk Home in oreder to show a more real look to the segregation that existed in the South.  The movie however went beyond my expectations and proved to more enjoyable and informative then I originally thought.  The movie is a beautiful story that revolves around the historic Montgomery Bus Boycott.  The characters are all strong and memorable, and are portrayed by amazingly convincing actors and actresses.  The movie brings to life the real story and hardships felt by the negro society of America during these troubling times.  The Long Walk Home is a movie that questions the morality princples that one lives by, and is also a movie that reveals the characters as both true to life and historically correct.  The Long Walk Home is an amazing movie to watch when one wants to see the struggle of human goodness verse that of immoral attitudes. The movie also questions whether the viewer is a person who follows along with congregated crowd or if they follow the less traveled more righteous path.
