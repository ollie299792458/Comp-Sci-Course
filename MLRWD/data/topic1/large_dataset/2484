You know the ones: The Moon landing was filmed in a sound stage, Jim Morrison is alive and well and living in Paris and the Holocaust never happened. Your explanation of the technical details of the Final Solution are as empty and vacuous as the inside of your apparatly Neo-Nazi shaved head. Trying to dismiss away the holocaust as a rumor or fable as you soo succintly did in your review shows that there is still such an overriding hatred towards the Hebrew people that people can write such nonsense as you have wriiten. This movie may not have all of the facts, but it makes up for it in spades elsewhere. The acting of Brannaugh and Tucci, the historically accurate uniform, setting, mannerisms, and the 100% accurate portrayal of the Nazi war machine as a blood-thirsty, misguided, and childish group of boys, frames this movie along with the likes of Shindler's List, The Pianist, Grey Zone, Uprising and escape from Sobibor. I am not a Jew, but I empathize with all of those that lost thier lives, loved ones, or everything they owned to the Nazi infantile war machine. If you need a little prodding to help you rejoin the human race, visit the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC. Get a grip "A viewer" Goose-step back in to the human race.
