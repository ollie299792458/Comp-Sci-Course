This is definitely something to watch if you want to get away from your average anime series. I would call it a drama more than anything, with a tiny bit of action and sci-fi thrown in. The animation is unique and very well done. Even knowing the story, from the novel and other Count films, it will still keep you on the edge of your seat waiting to find out the secrets behind all the characters. The music and sound is good, being mainly classical and ambient. It seems like of all of the series I have watched, they always have excellent or at the very least memorable opening and closing credit music. Although the music that repeatedly cues the end of almost every episode is awesome, the opening and ending songs here are HORRIBLE! The dub also could have been better. It seems like the same group of actors do EVERY anime series. If you've watched Last Exile, Cowboy Bebop, Planetes, even Lupin the third, you will hear all the familiar voices, and it's irritating to me. Those being my only two real complaints, it's still a very enjoyable series. I only see two ratings on here, and that sucks. This show is worthy of much more attention.
