It is quite amazing how this film manages to sneak its perverse political ideas under a coat of "common sense" idealism: "why don't people just like each other every once in a while." Frightening to witness the charming Longfellow Deeds explain how some people just can't make it, and how he, in a textbook impersonation of Jesus Christ, will save them. Forget that the film ignores problems and questions by either simplifying them to the level of a 10 year old, or mocking them. The simple people that it pretends to defend are silenced and reduced to a supporting mindless crowd (the manipulation of crowds and typage are worthy of Eisenstein) for a hero that borders on proto-fascism (the constant endorsement of physical violence is sickening). Doesn't it bother anyone that the female heroine goes from a strong and smart reporter to a brainless hysterical child whose only purpose in life is marriage?
Unfortunately, the ideas Capra (and Riskin) push are highly problematic. Take your "common sense" goggles off--the problem with common sense is that there is no such thing: some people think it common sense that women should stay at home, others that whites are better than blacks. Common sense is what people use to justify their view of the world. 
I agree that we have, here, a master filmmaker at work--a master of propaganda.
