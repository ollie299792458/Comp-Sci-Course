A magazine columnist once wrote in a movie review for "Waiting to Exhale" that when you're dying of thirst, you don't exactly need Evian.  This is how I've felt about the vast majority of gay-themed movies.  Most of them, to be blunt, are crap.  Supply and demand dictates that, due to the relatively few writers and directors working in this genre, that most gay-themed movies are disappointing and would never be green-lit if their audience was more mainstream, i.e., straight.

"Boy Culture", despite its generic title, is a refreshing exception to this rule.  Warm, touching, sexy, and smart, this movie is a good example of gay independent movie making.  The voice-over of the main character may be a bit cheap, but it's quite effective in the end.  The leads are all extremely watchable, attractive, and endearing.  I don't know which one of them was gay or straight, but I neither did I care.  Each of them inhabited their roles without resulting to trite stereotypes, or, as insulting to me, personally, the opposite -- playing "straight".  The result was that I felt that each character was a real person.

While I do not think it will appeal to the majority of straight audiences, it is simply a Must-Watch for us gays.  And straight viewers with an open mind and a romantic sensibility will certainly not be disappointed.
