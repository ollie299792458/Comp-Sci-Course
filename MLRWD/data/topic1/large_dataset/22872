This movie was AWESOME!!! If you like terratino movies you will like this.. In 3D this movie was a blast.. I can see alot of people not liking this movie, This is just like a Quintin movie in the fact the way it was shot, the motions of the camara, This is the way the movie was ment to be if anyone reads the back of the dvd case, so if you dont like terratino movies, dont get this and give it a 1, thats a waist!!! Im not pointing out the bad points that i didnt like, because people are so differnt, and will like the points i dont, but there is one spot in this movie i loved, i thought it was funny because this is a MOVIE,,, ENTERTAINMENT if anyone can understand what that is!!!!  Tell you the one spot,,,, Millton goes to a hotel room with this girl, they start to whooom whoooom,, LOL, While they are ""whoommen"" Guys come to Kill Millton, and he starts shooting the people WHILE he is ""Whooom whooomin"", What a kick i got out of that in 3D it was really good!! so if anyone likes quintin movies GET THIS BLAST!!!
