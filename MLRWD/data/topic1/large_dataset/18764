'American Pie' is great!  I went to see it twice at the cinema, and I  can't wait to get it on DVD.  Previous reviewers have been right to say  it's like a version of 'Porkies' for the nineties - it's a modern updating  of the 80's frat-house comedy genre in more ways than one.  By contrast  with its earlier (inferior) cousin, 'American Pie' is intelligent,  unexploitative and has decent roles for its female characters.  
It's  also tempting to compare 'Pie' to 'There's Something About Mary' because  both films share a high gross-out factor - Jim's exploits with the pie, his  sock (!) and a collection of adult magazines form a running joke through  the course of the whole film, and there probably isn't a sexual taboo that  isn't confronted.  And of course there's the funny-tasting beer and the  laxative gags (both of which the film would have been better without,  really).
But to compare 'American Pie' with either of these other films  is to miss what makes is truly unique - its outlook is unashamedly romantic  and optimistic, with a complex set of messages that you'd never expect from  a film nominally about four guys out to get laid.  Our heroes'  relationships evolve in entirely different, unexpected ways, largely  avoiding clich&eacute;s and cheap gags too... resulting in much of the film being  totally hilarious: the live-sex Internet broadcast is awesomely funny.  See  this film... after which you might consider getting the soundtrack, if only  for the wonderful Bic Runga track, 'Sway'.
