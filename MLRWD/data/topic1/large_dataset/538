Without a doubt, this is not for little kids. They simply will not understand much of the material that is showed in the beginning, but for Bond, James Bond fans, this show excels The Incredibles, which had a very Bond-ish feel to it (music, creeping around, etc.). This film was blatant Bond in classic form, complete with a shallow reason for hating the world and a hidden villain that is revealed only at the last moment by . . . of all cars, Mater!

The is one moment that had my wife and in stitches (and the player in pause) but for the most part, the humor is not over the top. Sure, the show is fun, but unless you're really alert, you can easily become lost through the first half of the show. And that's too bad, considering the amount of work that must have gone into making this incredible film.

So what didn't I like enough to give this five stars? The somewhat confusing plotline for one thing. That and this certainly was not geared for young children, which is where most of the Pixar films shine (with a couple of exceptions -- Up being one of them).
