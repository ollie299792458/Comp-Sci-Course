I saw this film first in a library DVD and was very disappointed, but since I'm trying to collect Rock Hudson DVDs, I ordered one.  It was only minimally better the second time around.  Why?  Where do I start?
First, the premise of Andrews being a German spy did not sit well  How could one find such a character appealing?
Second, Hudson was ill used, although, to give him credit, he did try his best.  (It seems, according to Hudson biographers, that Edwards and Andrews ill-treated and bad-mouthed Hudson on the set -- it may or may not be true, but Andrews was quoted as saying, "I'm the only queen on this set."  All in all, it was NOT a good experience for Hudson, in spite of the fact that, reportedly, Hudson was Edwards' choice for the leading role.)
The sets, costumes and filming were excellent, but the plot was quirky, especially with the introduction of two Laurel & Hardy-type French investigators.  A scene with them spying on the lovers was a disaster no matter how one looks at it.
Edwards, besotted with his new bride in real-life, didn't have the brains to turn Hudson loose to do what he did best in other films:  Make love to his leading lady onscreen.  With the exception of one short scene with the two of them in the shower, Hudson's comedic and romantic talents were pretty much bypassed.
I found some scenes draggy, and the all-is-forgiven ending was a poor fairy tale for any American or Britisher who has lived through a German-Allied war and/or had relatives killed by the enemy.  In real-life, Andrews' character would've been shot or at very least imprisoned for years rather than being applauded by the British soldiers.
This could have been a superb movie in many ways; it was a disappointing disaster for a Rock Hudson fan, although Andrews fans will not be disappointed, as she sings several songs beautifully, and even does an effective strip-tease at one point.  (Don't ask; it's sort of part of the plot.)
