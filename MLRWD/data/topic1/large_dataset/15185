SCREAM is not only the best horror movie, but the best movie ever! It is filled with wit, shocks, scares, and humor. These fine qualities are all blended flawlessly together to form a masterpiece! From a lot of other reviews I've read, people think this movie is merely a satire of horror movie cliques and is not scary. Well, I'll tell you, it is VERY SCARY! Yes, there are satire, but it is so clever and makes the movie more enjoyable!  Stunning performance from Neve Campbell. She portrays Sidney, the protaginist, and does a spectacular job of making her seem relatable, likeable, and more! Skeet Ulrich is perfect! His acting abilities are astonishing and his looks are wonderful. ;) Many other impeccable performances from Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Drew Barrymore, Matthew Lillard, Jamie Kennedy, and Rose McGowan. Not only was it filled with great acting, but the screenplay was exceptional! The plot was excellent and the ending had an exceedingly clever twist. Kevin Williamson did a superlative job! And Wes Craven did a tremendously fine job directing this work of art. Before I didnt like scary movies. But when I saw SCREAM, my whole view on the horror genre changed! Now I am a huge fan of thrillers! So to those horror fanatics and those who, like me before, don't like scary movies, I reccomend this movie to everyone! Go buy it! It'll be definitly worth it!!!
