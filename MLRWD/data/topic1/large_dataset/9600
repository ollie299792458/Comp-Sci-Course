I admit that I am not normally one who likes to have faith mixed in with my movie.  I normally find myself more interested in the fantastical worlds such as Mirrormask, the amazing adventures of Doctor Who, the mindless bloodshed of Resident Evil, or the quirky humor of Shawn of the Dead than an inspirational film such as this.  But every once in awhile I find a little gem that is just too good to not watch, and this movie most definitely fits the bill.

Some people have issue with the faith based overtones.  I've though about it for awhile and decided that this is my answer to those issues:  It doesn't matter if a film has a Christian overtone, Buddhist overtone, no overtone, somewhat of a maybe overtone or whatever.  A good movie is a good movie, and this film is definitely a good movie.  From what I've seen in interviews and the like, Bethany and her family are deeply religious people whose faith helped them deal with this.  I would say that if there WASN'T an overtone it would do the story a disservice.

So why the 4 stars?  This is a slight bit of overacting at parts in my opinion, plus, while I find this an excellent film I do not put it with my favorite all time films ever.  I would give it a 4.5 but that is not an option.
