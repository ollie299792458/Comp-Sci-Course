I have a taste for Ozzy, Aerosmith and Metallica's music. When some friends popped this movie into the DVD player, I rolled my eyes and groaned in silence. I wasn't really in the mood for a cookie-cutter 'hood' movie - you know the ones loaded with stereotype thugs, drive by shootings, flashy cars and plenty of bling. However, you learn from the first scene that DJay's character was not a 'cliche pimp'. As this movie progressed, I grew more impressed with the down to earth story of people just trying to pay the rent and...like everyone else...struggling to find a future. The acting was rich throughout and the unexpected drama that unfolds tears at your heart because of the hope and attachment you build with all of the supporting characters.

*** Spoiler Alert ***

My favorite scene was the look in Shug's eyes when she first heard her recorded voice, to me that was the instance when the dream became tangible. There were several other favorites to include Nola's understanding with DJay when she admits that she knows when she is being manipulated but sometimes she needs it, the 'soul kiss' (as the director calls it in the commentaries) that DJay gives to Shug before his bold move to promote his demo tape to Skinny Black and then the sinking feeling when DJay sees what Skinny ends up doing with his demo tape. The depth with which Terrence Howard showed DJay's character was tremendous. I'm not going to start playing 'crunk' at home just yet, but the movie definitely holds my respect. I have since bought the DVD for my own collection and have watched it again several times. Good choice for any music lover, regardless of your preference...and definitely don't judge a DVD by it's cover, it had me fooled at first. It was hard giving this one a 5, but a 4 didn't give it enough credit.
