Based on Stephen Ambrose's "D-Day" masterpiece,Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" - especially thefirst 25 minutes - will give you a better idea of what combat is really like... but "The Longest Day", based on another masterpiece (the book of the same name by Cornelius Ryan), illustrates better than any Hollywood picture how war is an organizational effort, won - or lost - not by a handful of superheroes but by a combination of armies, units, and individuals, along with healthy doses of planning, determination, and luck.
P.S.  A note to the person complaining that none of the main Allied characters getting killed in the movie: Since the film recreates the real-life experiences of soldiers on June 6, 1944 - as told in hundreds of interviews after the war to journalist-author Cornelius Ryan - it stands to reason that every single one of the interviewees obviously - obviously! - survived Operation Overlord (and, indeed, the war).  And if one observes closely, none of the characters played by the major German actors is actually killed either, and that for the same obvious reason.
