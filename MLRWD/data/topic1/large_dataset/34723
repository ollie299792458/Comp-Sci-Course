Despite being a romantic comedy, Music and Lyrics is refreshing and funny. Drew Barrymore is warm and likeable as Sophie and Hugh Grant is charming as cynical has-been, Alex Fletcher. Alex and Sophie's connection feels real, as we actually see them get to know each other and learn to relate to each other, unlike some rom-coms, where the heroes fall in love over playfull banter alone. The conflicts between them are also real, instead of feeling contrived, and the lessons that each learn are believable and relatable. By the end of the movie, we are definitely rooting for them to reach their full potential, both individually, and as a couple. I like the fact that, despite dealing with the glamorous music industry, this is a normal, "average person" story. The final resolution is not a grand gesture to sweep the heroine off her feet. It is just heartfelt honesty from Alex to Sophie. The good acting, the romantic story, and great music make this movie a keeper.

The only thing that stops me from giving it a full five stars is that I am not a huge fan of the romantic comedy genre, in general.
