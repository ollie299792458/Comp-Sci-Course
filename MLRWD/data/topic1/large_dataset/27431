I remember being assigned to read the book "The Exorcist" by William Peter Blatty, for a class entitled "Atheism and Theism" in the Theology curriculum at Marquette University when I was a student there in 1973. It was a night in late November when I sat down in an old rocking chair by the window in my room in the old boarding house I lived in that was mainly populated by Upper-level Marquette students. It was about 5:30 PM or so on a Thursday night, and I thought I would read this book for a few hours, which looked SO UNINTERESTING at the time.

I had no inkling of the literary journey I was about to embark on.

Snow started falling outside and shone heavily under the streetlight in the alley behind the house. It was a smooth feeling. It fell to a depth of at least 3-4 feet.

Meanwhile, I was engrossed in one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. I didn't put it down until I was done...... around 6 AM the next morning. "The Exorcist" by William Peter Blatty remains one of my favorite books of all time.

I saw the movie a short time later. It was ... and IS ... tremendous and terrifying. When Linda Blair's head did the 360 for the priests, there was wretching in the theatre. I had NEVER seen that before...and considering the time frame (almost 40 years ago) it was WAY AHEAD of its' time in imaginative terror. AND they, the book/movie, were supposedly based on a TRUE story.

Ellen Burnstyn, Jason Miller, Linda Blair, Lee J. Cobb and Max Von Sydow as "the Exorcist" gave masterful performances. I especially liked Jason Miller's portrayal of the priest/physician/psychiatrist who ultimately tips the scale towards Good and God, and away from Evil and the devil, by giving his own life.

A complex movie which almost certainly has to be watched a few times to get a feel for all that is put into this cinematic masterpiece. I enjoy watching it STILL, to this very day.
