As a parent I've sat through my share of crummy kid's flicks.  "The Tale of Despereax" however, left me stunned.  This was less of a chilren's movie and more of a primer on how to commit child abuse.

Movie devotees will rave about the animation which was first rate, but the story was terrible.  Look at the trailer and you'd think the story was about a cute little mouse waving a needle like a sword.

Well, that cute little mouse is turned over to grand inquisitors BY HIS PARENTS because he refuses to cower.  For his crime, Desperaux is sentenced to be eaten by rats.

Repulsed yet?  Add to that a young girl, Miggery Sow, beaten, abused and sold into slavery along with a bunch of pigs.  She winds up at the castle, steals the princess' crown, gets offended when someone laughs at her and drags the King's daughter down to the dungeon so she too can be eaten by rats.

Desperaux rushes to tell the King that the princess is in the cellar about to be eaten alive but the old fool is too busy wallowing in self-pity to lift a finger.

Then someone whips up a pot of soup and all is sunshine again.

I will never take my son to a Dreamworks production again without checking the reviews first.  A plot line that features rats eating young girls and cute little mice is not suitable for children...or their parents.
