This is a great movie! The Japanese subtitled version is an improvement on the dubbed version I used to see on tv back in the early 80s. There is a great sense of menace, with more background on the abandoned ship found by the castaways. Ishiro Honda shows he can do more than the kaiju films (I LOVE those too, don't get me wrong), making an effective horror movie/morality tale.

The extras on the disc are great too, with the original story told over scenes of the movie, and another story by the same author. A commentary by star Akira Kubo is interesting, though he spends more time talking about his career in general, as opposed to Matango. A featurette on the makeup and special effects is informative and fun, also.

The script was well written, with tension among the castaways contrasted with the growing menace (the tension was done much better than in the movie Goke: Body Snatcher From Hell, another japanese movie from 1968, which I thought sucked). The monsters were well done, as was the derelict ship.

Don't pass this one up, if you get the chance. I just ordered the movie Varan the Unbelievable, and hope the same good job was done on that disc.
