It was very nice to see an affordable (extremely affordable) release of WISEGUY season 1.  I was a big fan of WISEGUY during its initial run on CBS in the late 80's, although I did not start watching until the second season.  I did catch the Proffit arc 2 years later, when it aired on CBS late night.  Now I have just seen the Steelgrave arc for the first time.  I have heard about the Nights in White Satin issue but never having seen the original I didn't have an attachment to it.  I decided to see what the deal was and found video of the sequence on line with the original music.  Now, some reviews have stated that the replacement music is generic, I suppose that is correct if you call it generic WISEGUY music as it is taken from the theme of the show.  Honestly I thought the original version was a bit overdone but I do prefer that original versions be left intact.

This brings me to my point.

It boggles my mind that music companies or artist or whomever is responsible get in the way of the original music being kept on older TV series (why does this never happen with movie releases).  It would seem to me an excellent opportunity for record companies, artists, whomever to get some cheap if not free advertising.  Just imagine an extra on the DVD release of WISEGUY that lists all the original music used and where it could be found for purchase.  Just think how many people would buy a copy of Nights in White Satin if the song had been kept intact on the show and an extra like this had encouraged them to do so.  Would this not make the record companies, artist, whomever money.  It would probably increase the sales of the DVD and thus send more people to buy the song and so on and so forth.  Sorry for the ranting but I just think this would work.

In closing,it is a great DVD and well worth the price!
