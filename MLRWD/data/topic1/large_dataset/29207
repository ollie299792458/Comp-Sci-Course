Most of this movie follows a frat boy trying to find his way out of the closet while his lover is unconscious in the hospital from gay-bashing. You don't know whether or not he'll make it. Some of the frat brothers argue against showing any sort of support for their injured frat brother because "he's a fag."

You can probably guess by other reviews that call the movie "heartwarming" that the hospitalized boy pulls through in the end, the protagonist gets past most of his hang ups, and things generally work out in the end. Still, I think it ends on a subdued note--the characters are all still working things out. But they've definitely grown, and there's a nice subplot with minor characters that show up at the ending.

At first, the preponderance of macho males--mostly actors looking ten years older pretending to be college men--was off-putting (yeah, didn't really think "movie about frat boys" through before watching), and the protagonist's homophobia was frustrating, but I came to care about the characters.
