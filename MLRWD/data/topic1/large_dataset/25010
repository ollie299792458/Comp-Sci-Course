I hardly remember the book and this movie did little to refresh my memory. I do recall how Rowling wasted 200 pages with Hermione & Harry apparating around the country doing NOTHING, and the overall impression of being underwhelmed by the story (or lack thereof).

I thought they would cut short all the Harry & Hermione "on the run" sequence from the book since it doesn't do anything to advance the story. But I was so wrong.  There is  what seems like 12 hours of nothing but H&H camping, again doing nothing to advance the story.

There is so little action, so little dialog and so many slow-moving scenes that I couldn't watch the whole thing.  I started fast forwarding after about an hour that felt like half a day and only watched scenes where people actually talked to each other (rather than just staring at each other) or some action, no matter how meager, was taking place.

I did enjoy the "Three Brothers" sequence. The animation was very interesting and unusual.  As for the rest of the film I recommend that if you must see it, you rent it or see at a theater, but don't waste your money on buying it.
