I had watched this version of Emma while in my young teens and disliked the movie very much. I have carried that dislike with me until recently now in my 20's I was compelled to watch this version again (I own the Kate Beckinsale version and like it). To my astonishment I actually like this version better! I like Austen's movie adaptations but have never read her books (except Sense and Sensibility in high school, which I don't remember). Some may call it lazy or unimaginative, but I prefer movies, though I know there would never be adaptations without the books but there it is. I do not know exactly what it was about this version that I like better; maybe that it seemed brighter and the characters were more fitting to their parts and there was more time to get to know each character better since this version is longer. The dialogue was much easier to understand (more modern that truely period based, but still fitting) and I am NOT a Paltrow fan but she was perfect in this role as Emma. I do still like the Beckinsale version, but I am almost sorry that I own it rather than this one, but am too cheap to own both =-)....
