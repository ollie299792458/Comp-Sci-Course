I agree with many of these reviews that Branaugh did a great job with this work, but many downplay Reeves's role moreso than they should Keaton's. 
Reeves was playing a very flat character which gave him very little to work with. John the... Brother of Don Pedro (lol) was a self-said villain in this story, and never changed his viewpoint at all. It's not that Reeves couldn't act this character, it's because all of the other characters change at some point and give a better atmosphere to the story.
Keaton, however, should have enunciated his malapropisms better. When watching it, I could barely hear his lines, unless he was screaming out that, 'Let it be known, I am an ... lol Sometimes I referred back to the play to know what it was he was mumbling. His portrayal was good, but his delivery? Geh, too soft-spoken. The humor was wasted on that role due to his boring recital of the lines. His lines are devoid of emotion where he should have shown that he was confident in what he said.
All in all, it was a good movie. I really enjoyed seeing how Reeves took nothing which would barely be more than anything with the role of Don John and made it into where I enjoyed seeing his evil presence bent on thwarting love. Keaton's only saving grace was to ride away on invisible stallions. It and the proclomation of his lack of integrity were the only parts when I laughed.
