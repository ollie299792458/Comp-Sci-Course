This movie looked like a very safe bet, a thriller with actors of the caliber of Berry and Willis could not be half bad, right? Wrong! I was so disappointed by this movie that it is not even funny. The first thing that struck me was how bad the dialogues were. It is hard to believe somebody actually took the time to write these lines without trying to make them seem illogical on purpose. And talking about illogical, what about the ending? The final twist comes so far out from left field that I thought it was a joke, and even worse, it really makes little sense with the rest of the plot.

I have a hard time believing that the Halle Berry I saw in this film is the same actress that won an Oscar a couple of years ago. Her performance was disastrous, and the way in which she delivered her lines was completely wooden. Maybe she had a hard time dealing with the outright bad script, but that cannot be an excuse. Especially because when you look at Bruce Willis and even Giovanni Ribisi, you see that these two actors overcame the low quality plot and delivered performances that at least were good enough to be believable.

The story starts out as a good idea; a reporter (Berry) is trying to prove that ad mogul Harrison Hill (Willis) is the culprit in the murder of her childhood friend. The problem is that the plot quickly loses traction and the ending makes it all come tumbling down in flames. Stay away from this one at all cost!
