I'm so glad I splurged on this DVD set - it's great! The instruction is clear, and I know how to keep my form in check (which I found was substantially lacking with Tracy Anderson's DVD). I love the little intervals of work, so that you work hard and then get to stretch the tight muscles. This makes you feel really good both during the workout and when it's over, because you don't get that tight, I-just-did-strength-training feeling. I love that they encourage real pushups too - a great balance between upper body, lower body, and abs. The addition of the playground ball is great, and I really couldn't believe one little ball could do so much for my thighs!

The only downside I could foresee for some people is that the instructor for the 57- and 30-minute DVDs can be a little cheesy at times, saying things like "Do you have a license for those guns?", but I find her cheesiness to be motivating and disarming. She's very encouraging and helps you get through the tough spots, of which there are plenty!

This is one of the best workout DVDs I've bought in a long time, and definitely the best of this genre (barre-style). After doing it for a couple months, I still can't complete all the reps for a few exercises - and I usually run and lift weights 5 days/week at the gym, so don't think because you're not using heavy weights that it's not challenging.

For all these reasons, I highly recommend you try this awesome workout video!
