So this is a very cute movie!! If u like any of the 80's chick flick movies this one will definaletly be one of them after you watch it! Its a cute movie. its about a teenage girl named Louise having a tough time in high school not being popular and lusting after one of the most popular guys in school! To add to the fusteration she learns that she is a decendant from witches  from salem, and starts gaining powers! It takes her by a surprised! Then she starts to have too much fun with it! She does so many things with her powers, and relizes in the end nothing was real, all the friends she had and all the attention was fake! So she decides on either giving up her powers or keeping them and all her fake friends! So needless to say this is a big chick flick but its totally cute!! I recommend this to anyone! I have been waiting for this movie to come out on dvd finally! ALl I have to say is finally its out! I didnt want to buy this on vhs cause who really wants to have a bunch of dvds and then one vhs sitting on the shelf!
