I have seen this film three times now and it only gets better. It is not often these days to find a movie that decides to hold back on the gore and actually construct a story. After a slow start, this film hits its stride as John Cusack checks into room 1408 and never lets up. I dont mean its action action action. No, its a series of little moments that become compelling and you can feel the inner turmoil of Cusack as he descends deeper into despair. There is a moment with his daughter that is so real and played so beautifully by the actors and the director that is was heartbreaking. I know most people dont watch horror films for that but it shocked me and how much I felt for the characters. This is a superior film and does not ever descend to the level of more contemporary films. It leads to an ending that made me think. It is a film to watch again and again. I loved it.
Also, John Cusack is nothing short of superb. I have known of him but I honestly cannot think of a single movie of his Ive seen, except Sixteen Candles. I cannot praise his performance enough. It is Oscar worthy, it is brilliant. Not a false note throughout.
So I highly recommend this film.
