This is one of those movies that I always wish i had never seen , Solely because I envy those seeing it for the first time . In the mid 6o,s this wonderfully crafted piece blasted on to our cinema screens , blowing away all prior images of the gangster genre (For a little while at least , We still go back to Caggers ,Bogie and Eddie G  , for our infusions of escapist gangsterism )  This film has a little of everything in its portrayal of irresponsible ineptitude during a period where the public were led to believe in the faultless guile and practise of these supposed matinee idols . The movie constantly reminds us of our fallabilities and we end up loving the cast for them . the early opportunities to see the futures of the fabulous  ''Two Genes'' , Hackman and Wilder reveal the talent spotters skills in promoting these to to the A list as the 60.s drew to a close . for many , me included Warren Beatty  was never better , how many of us then adolescent were comforted by  the fallabilities portrayed here along with his glamourous aspirations which thank god few followed to its extreme one has to believe !!  Faye Dunaway , well this was her zenith to on reflection and how these two slipped thru the academy,s lists remains to me a puzzle yet to be completed . This  collectors piece has everything the enthusiast could hope for in a collectors edition , fabulous . if I am forced to criticise , the actual packaging is not up to region 1 standard . After all US packagiung gives so much more added value that British releases normally  this package could have been designed with a clipped budget perhaps ??  get this into your shopping basket now !!
