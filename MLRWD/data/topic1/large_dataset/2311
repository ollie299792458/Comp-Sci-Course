Oi, it's true this has come out on dvd already but, hey it came out on dvd almost ten years ago.  Back then DVD players were around the price of 700 bucks so, this movie was released in a very very small print run...... Here it is 2006 dvd players are 50 bucks and this movie is still not rereleased and ironicly sells more than it cost to buy a dvd player!?!? Whats up with that?????  Why has this great cheesy sci fi film yet to see a reissue or some sort of "collectors tin" edition just so they can charge 30 bucks. Either way I'd be estatic to see this come out on dvd at a price I could afford!!!  The only thing I could see thats preventing this from being rereleased is the soundtrack royalties...... If so, hey queen please don't be greedy or hey universal don't be cheap on royalties.... I don't know who's at fault but, come on bring this film to dvd again at a price we can afford.... Someone is sitting on this film because it's not even rerunned on some offshoot of a turner network like it was throughout the eighties..... Bring this back to dvd! Flesh Gordon is easily findable on dvd but, not the real movie..... Oh, as for a review of this film this is a movie about a jets quaterback who saves the universe! And in space if one recalls dudes bleed blue blood since theres no oxygen ;) And the soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks made by one band for a movie period. No songs feel forced into the movie... Instead each track flows perfectly with this film.... IE this was made in the day when soundtracks where just that soundtracks to the film. Not some junk to sell a new "artist's" single like soundtracks are so like today.....
