I just watched the "20th" anniversary of "Fast Times" on TV.  Apparently they are counting 20 years from the time the movie was finished shooting since it wasn't released until 1982.  Just before I saw it in 1982 (when I was 15), a local movie critic said it basically was to the 80's what "Porky's" was to the 50's, but I think "Fast Times" is a much better movie in just about every way, especially in taste.
I really don't agree with some of the other reviewers who say that it was very realistic.  But what movie is?  Don't get me wrong, it was a really good movie, but most high school students don't fall into those strict catagories depicted in the movie.
I saw high school as a student in the 80's and as a teacher today.  Despite popular sentiment, most schools are safer now than they were then, and at least in the suburbs, there are less drugs.
But back to the subject.  The basic storylines are a bit shallow, but they are developed well and the acting is great.  Why didn't Phoebe Cates ever make it bigger?!?  One reviewer mentioned that kids who see this movie (especially boys) will wish they got as much action as many of the characters!
Enjoy the movie, but don't include the children.  Besides all the drugs, there is plenty of foul language and one nude scene.
