To say that Sam Elliott was deftly cast would be an understatement.  Rarely has an actor been so perfectly suited to play such a memorable character from literature.  He was the absolute embodiment of Sam Damon.  With a performance so off-the-scale good, how was he not even nominated for an Emmy?  (Probably because not too many Hollywood types who make the Emmy choices ever read the book -- hence the lack of appreciation.)

It's easy to take issue with the deviations from the book, particularly the ending.  (Even with nearly 9 hours to play with, something's gotta give in any screen adaptation of a novel of such length.)  But what's indisputable is how well the show captures the book's tone and spirit.  I thought the remade-for-TV ending involving the angry Sam Damon-Court Massengale confrontation was the best scene in the entire miniseries -- a satisfying, well-timed conclusion.

Once an Eagle should never have slipped into such undeserved obscurity.  It might be the most unheralded achievement in TV history.
