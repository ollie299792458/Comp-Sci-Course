I can't understand why people who love a book keep on hurting themselves by watching movies "adapted" from those books! If you can't go watch a movie knowing that it will not be like the book, DON'T WATCH IT!! Why don't you try to go watch such a movie telling yourself that it's a *different story*. That would be easier on you!

 Anyway, I really enjoyed the movie, I thought the chemistry between Matt Damon and Franka Potente was there and worked well.

 I enjoyed the fact that there weren't endless action sequences, I get totally bored with those. I think Matt Damon, because he is not a usual action hero, gave some depth to the character.

 I thought the plot was cool (not profound, but good enough) and I had an awesome time.

 What else can you expect from a movie? It's great if you have a good time, you can't expect to be changed profoundly by a movie all the time, right?

 I also greatly enjoyed the Bourne Supremacy, I thought it was about the same quality (so people who hated the first movie, please, please, don't go watch the 2nd one!!! It has EVEN LESS to do with the book!!!)
