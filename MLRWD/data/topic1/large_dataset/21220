As a dancer since three and aspiring Broadway performer, I was excited to hear that Chicago was going to finally be made into a movie.  Having seen the Broadway revival, I had high expectations for this film.  I was expecting Fosse choreography or at least Fosse inspired choreography.  I got Rob Marshall (who is a choreographer) and loved it.  Completely going away from Fosse choreography was an ingenious idea.  The casting of Zeta-Jones was inspired.  She started out doing Broadway in England and it is obvious.  All you need to see is "All That Jazz" and "I Can't Do It Alone" to prove that she deserved the Oscar.  People are being hard on Zellwegger.  Remember this though, Roxie is an aspiring Vaudeville performer and not that great.  Yes, in the movie she is picturing all these performances in her head but the certain roughness in her dancing and singing is to be expected.  It adds the charm.  Gere was in Grease on Broadway in the 70s and while it has been a long time coming, he did wonderfully.  His three months work on the tap dance was obvious.  John C. Reilly gave a wonderful performance in Mr. Cellophane.  As for the critics wondering why Lucy Liu and others are in there, it's because everyone wanted to be involved in this project.  The best was Chita Rivera's bit part.  So unexpected.  As for the people who bash Chicago because of Moulin Rouge, get over it.  The two are different ideas.  Both musicals, but if everything looked the same, it would be boring.  Moulin Rouge was shot with interesting camera angles to add to the whimsy of the movie.  Chicago was shot to best show the choreography.  And Nicole Kidman is not a better singer than Zellwegger or Zeta-Jones.  Her voice is too thin.  And I also own Moulin Rouge and love it.  Just don't ask me to pick which is my favorite.
