I was greatly impressed with the accuracy of this film, specifically according to 'Here I Stand,' an official biography of Martin Luther.
There were certain things omitted, but most were not intregal to grasping a picture of who brother Martin was, and what was going on at the time - you only have so much time in a movie, for a more complete picture of his life, read aforementioned biography; yet you'll find the film makers did an excellent job following the point by point events of his life, and capturing well his personality.  While some viewers may misunderstand some of the lightly touched upon scenes of prayer in Martin's struggle (some have said he seemed deeply disturbed or 'bi-polar' by the film representation) with the devil, these were nontheless accurate, and also portray well that Martin had an understanding of spiritual warfare; I was actually glad that the scene before his trail wherein he seemed to be frantically arguing with the devil was portrayed.
Some have complained that the film did not delve well enough into Luther's deeper beleifs and doctrines, yet here again we cannot rely exclusively on film for such a full portrayal, if one is truly interested one must do some reading.  All in all, an excellent film portrayal of much of Martin Luther's life and ministry broken down well for the layman.
