I finally watched "High Tension" a few nights ago with a friend. I'm a horror fan in general, and had been meaning to see the film, since hearing and reading about it being a great movie.

Oddly enough, I had just watched Alexandre Aja's second film, "The Hills Have Eyes", which I both enjoyed and was pretty impressed by. It wasn't a masterpiece or anything, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, and find it a solid horror film. After watching that, I had high hopes for High Tension.

After watching High Tension, I wasn't exactly sure what to feel about it. Yes, I'm with the concensus- It was definitely a good horror film, and certainly caught me off guard. Now, I'm not one to be too bothered by gore, but the raw, gritty and violent feel to some of the scenes got to me. I don't mean to sound 'horrified for life', but more to compliment Aja in the fact that he succeeded with his gut-wrenching sequences.

My only gripe is that I feel that their are some loose ends in the plot itself. Nothing too detrimental for your enjoyment, but just some little things that I wish could have been explained a bit more. It's not my style anyway to nitpick- so don't let it bother you. If you're into horror, and looking for something different with a raw, classic feel - go for High Tension.
