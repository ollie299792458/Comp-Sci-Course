Too bad John Cleese and Connie Booth only wrote & produced 12 episodes, but re-playing them every once in a while will still provide enough laughs to cheer anyone up.

Anyone, that is, who likes to see the old-fashioned Britisher's penchant for public politeness and starchy protocol (no-matter-what the situation) get muddled and overcome by the practicalities of everyday life and the evolving (at the time) impatience with the stiff-upper-lip facade of British society -- a facade that began crumbling with the advent of Monty Python.  If you like watching how the Brits learned to poke fun at themselves in publicly-aired media, this one's for you.

Most episodes have that Monty Pythonian touch where over-exaggeration of a situation provides quite a bit of the humor, but the dialogs in Fawlty Towers are generally more witty and less slapstick than most of the Monty Python movies or TV skits I've seen.  An exception was the "Waldorf Salad" episode where the situation was exaggerated to an extreme that was too implausible to be funny, but even that episode has numerous punch lines that will evoke hearty laughter when regurgitated to those familiar with this outstanding series of 12.
