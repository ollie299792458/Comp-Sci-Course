I first saw this movie as teenager in the 1980`s. To me it is great in that context. If your a child of the 90`s ya prob arent gonna be able to relate to it, or dare I say appreciate it in its cheesy glory. Hey it was the 80`s man! Everything was cheesy ok! A guy that used to make movies with a chimpanzee was our president....Twice! and the Atari 2600 was the baddest game machine on the block....see what I mean?

 With that said, I will admit that I do laugh out loud during this movie, but it`s so ridiculous, and strikes a nerve so deep and forgotten that it is cool.

 I mean they killed his dog! How more of a bad guy can you get? And thank god for that six pack that he kept in that state owned Ram Charger! Popeye had spinach, McQuaid has beer!

 Things were more simple back then.

 Turn off 85% of your brain activity and check this movie out......if you`ve got the guts!

 P.S. The movie has the city of El Paso Texas as a back drop for many scenes, if you have an attachement to that city it`s pretty cool to see it on the screen.
