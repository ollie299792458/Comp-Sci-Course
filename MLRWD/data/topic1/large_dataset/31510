Though I have only seen a few episodes of this show and can't really call myself a fan of it, I have to say that at the time of writing, this set costs $14.99 on Amazon, which to my mind is the best price on a multidisc new TV Season that I can think of. You just can't go wrong.

I think that if prices were always so low, more of us would experiment and get DVD sets of shows we wouldn't normally get. That would open us up to more novel and interesting viewing experiences, and we might discover some great gems in the process.

My note to studios - Please follow this lead and mark down your DVDs, please. DVDs are not too expensive to make, for years we have been ripped off by paying too much for it. I read on a forum recently that a 6-Disc DVD set would actually only cost about $8 to make (DVD cost included).

My note to viewers - even if you're not sure, get this show simply because of the low price. If we support initiatives such as this, we are guaranteeing lower prices on other DVD sets in the future. Lets get the studios to wake up!
