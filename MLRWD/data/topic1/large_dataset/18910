Pitch Black was an entertaining B movie. The Chronicles of Riddick is an entertaining B movie with a larger budget. Some random comments/observations/questions...1. The fictional universe of COR is more technologically advanced than the one in Pitch Black. A continuity issue if you watch them back to back, however each story stands alone (more or less) so it's not really a problem...2. Plot holes galore, though the action is enough of a distraction so you tend not to notice until afterwards... 3. The DVD `unrated' version is still PG-13, or damn close to it.... 4. Why do they feed the prisoners to the rock-dogs when the prisoners are a source of income for the prison?... 5. Cool looking Necromonger armor. Too bad it's completely useless, unable to protect the wearer from an energy weapons, a blade, or even a well placed drop-kick. The guy might as well be wearing pagamas...6. Riddick is suppose to be evil, a different kind of evil according to the voice over in the movie. The sense of malice that Riddick possessed in PB is absent in COR. He's an action hero now, with action hero morals. He won't kill you unless you're a bad guy. Maybe that's character development... 7. Goggles on, googles off. Goggles on, googles off. Goggles on, googles off. Make up your mind already!... 8. Wouldn't it have been great if Riddick had a plucky side-kick for comic relief? Someone like Rob Schneider in Judge Dredd. Ok, maybe not.
