I haven't seen the original movies (cept for the disney one with Erik von Detten) or read the book so I'mnot gonna bother with comparing them to the new movie...

I enjoyed this movie very much, the chemistry between the four leads was great... Dwayne shows his comedy chops as Jack Bruno, you root for him instantly to save Sara and Seth.

Special effects have come a long way in movies (specially LOTR)... one of my faves from the movie was when Seth "phased" out of the Cab and the SUV smacked into him, going into a million pieces.

The guy who played the lead government agent was very good at playing an a**.

Good job at mixing the comedy, drama, and suspense (specially when the one agent during the gunfight in the facility said "I could use a gun right now..." someone hands him a gun and he says "thank you... this is a big gun" HAHA)

The ending wasn't wrapped up too quickly, also a plus. Watch the credits though, cause it wraps up a few things from the movie with a few scenes.

Only qualm I had: (if this isn't on the special features_ they didn't show the siblings reuniting with Jack/Alex.

Well worth 99 min of your time :)
