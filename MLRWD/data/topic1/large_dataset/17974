This in my opinion is the best horror film ever made. I don't know where some people come off when they say this was a thriller suspense. No, quite the contrary, it is a horror movie regardless of where you stand on this movie. The acting and character developments are not only great but very useful in this movie.  The story represents the ultimate battle  between good ( men of cloth ) and evil ( the devil ). It is this blatant use of the ultimate representation of evil, through an innocent girls body and mind , that makes us the viewers quite uneasy. This movie has dated quite well and one thing I love about this film is that is doesn't rely on heavy handed special effect or computer produced creations. For example the vomit wasn't computer generated but rather pea soup. When the bed floats it isn't trick photography, it is actually in the air held by suspension cables, I presume. It is this antiquated use of special effects, or lack thereof, that makes this movie even more scary because it adds quite well to the realism of this film. I believe the director had that in mind. The original film has poor hues in the film with some grain and colors that seem undistinct from one another.  The sharpness is at times dull but that isn't too much a distraction for the average viewer. Sound quality is decent.  Overall a great film .
