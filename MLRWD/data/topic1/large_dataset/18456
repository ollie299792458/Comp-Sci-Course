Last days of Disco is the third installment in Stillman's triology of movies (the otehr two being barcelona and Metropolitan). The formula for these movies has been to track the lives of thoughful indiviudals in very specific histortical/sociological context; discos final days, the fleeting days of high society in NY, Barcelona in the midst of violent cultural change. This movie is not for fans of Staurday Night Fever or Studio 54. It is constructed in a dramatic tradition and offers windows into the charactors lives and  how they function within a context. This movie may be the less engaging of the three but it is, most likely, the most approachable of the three. All three of these "period pieces" are worth owning on DVD but the odds are that most poeple will find this to be the most outwardly engaging of the three. The dialog is less loaded than Stillmans other two movies (mostly because the Charactors are less intertwined than those in the other two films.) Those unfmailar with Stillman would most likely like this movie if they are fans of dirrectors such as Hal Hartley or David Mamet,.
