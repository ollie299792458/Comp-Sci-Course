The crowd for this movie was enormous, so it was a good thing I bought my tickets in advance.  Every seat in the theater was filled, and I could barely hear myself think over the din.  When the movie started, everyone quieted down for a moment, and from the first sequence on, I could barely hear the movie over the laughter from the crowd and myself.  I found this to be one of the most funny movies I have ever seen--I don't think I stopped laughing for more than enough time to catch my breath throughout it.  The stunts performed are all excellent, and they are all extravagant enough for the big screen.  Knoxville and his crew wreak havoc, and many of the stunts occur in Japan.  This was not a low budget film; it must have cost MTV quite a small fortune.  This film is intended for immature audiences only--I doubt anyone that did not enjoy the show would like it, for stupidity is abundant, but some of the stunts are inventive.  So if you liked the TV show, you will definitely love this movie.
