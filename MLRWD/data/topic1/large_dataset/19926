Jack Nicholson shines in this extraordinary 70's film by writer/director Bob Rafelson. Nicholson plays a brilliant musician who hides away from a past he tried desperately to shed. He is a womanizer, and lives with a waitress (Karen Black) who hates and loves him. When he hears that his father is dying, he decides to return to his home, where he faces the ghosts of his past, through photgraphs, pianos, and his ghost-like father. It's about a man who tries to defy the rules. Consider the famous scene in the diner, where Nicholson orders a side order of toast. The waitress frowns at him, and tells him, "No side orders of toast. No substitutions." Instead of accepting it, he tells her, "Bring me a chicken sandwhich. No lettuce, to tomato, no mayo and no chicken." She asks him what to do with the chicken, and he tells her to "hold them between your knees." But afterwards, what most people forget is the small exchange in the car when he says, "It might have been clever, but I didn't get my toast."
