I had watched the mini series twice before and read the book, as well. I finally finished watching it again, seeing it in wide screen on DVD for the first time, thanks to this great set.

The mini series is a faithful replication of the book. The story of WWII is told from the point of view of the Henry family, whose patriarch and 2 sons are in the Navy. The characters, like people in real life, depict the emotional range you might expect to find during tumultuous times. The battle scenes are tense & exciting for the most part. But no words can describe the emotional intensity of the holocaust scenes, so realistic in their depiction of the horrors which took place. The location filming, along with actual historical film footage, certainly add to the realism.

There are lots of extras with this set. My favorite is "Director Dan Curtis' Commentary of Key Scenes," which gives some insight into the technical challenges of making the series.

My only complaint, which is minor, and has no bearing on the mini series itself, is that the packaging could be better. The 6 plastic plates, which hold 12 of the 13 discs, are held together with tape, which is fine. But they are then attached to the back plate of the package with a narrow strip of tape which doesn't hold when you have to open the package to get out the discs from the back third of the package. I think they could've done a better job of that.

I recommend this mini series to anyone wanting a glimpse of what life was like during the early to mid 1940s, during one of the darkest chapters in the history of our world.
