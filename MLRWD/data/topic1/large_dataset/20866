This movie is so funny.  It is about two brothers that have issues with each other. Vince Vaughn is the big brother to his "saintly" little brother Nicolaus.  He grows up in his shadow and is jealous and insecure.  But in the end they
resolve things and help a few other people along the way. The little boy that goes into foster care and then is adopted is wonderful (more people should be foster/adoptive parents).  Anyway, when Fred looses control toward DJ Donnie and changes the music to an Elvis song....well, I laugh so hard that I can not see straight.  Vince is dancing on the table and the elves are having a blast.....It is a great show.  I would say that it is for children over 10 but my 5 year old loves the "Elivs" part so much that we replay that section a lot.....all through out the year.  This is a great movie!!! There is one scene where there is a group of "unhappy siblings" in a group session. There is Clinton, Stalone, Baldwin and more but I have to say that
Bill Clinton's brother steals that scene. Fred calls it like he sees it and then when he sees things differently....well, he calls it differently...I hope that make sense.  I do not want to give it all away. It is a great movie. We watch it at least once a month.
