At the risk of seeming unpopular, I'll go out on a limb here and say, I really really liked this movie.
Now...having said that...let me back up...

I really liked Donnie Darko - even though I still dont know whats going on.
I really like James Marsden (Cameron baby - if its gonna make Jimmy happy - PRESS WHATEVER BUTTON HE TELLS YOU)
I really like Frank Langella
I went into this not knowing anything about it and tend to be able to go with the flow of most movies.

Richard Kelly will probably not be happy about this comparison, as I bet he wasn't thinking anything along these lines...but I thought the movie was as close to anything "Hitchcock-ian" as I've seen in years!  Just the right amount of suspense, mixed with thrills, mixed with humor, mixed with interesting characters, in situations well beyond their control - (at least it was out of control AFTER they pressed the d*mn button!)
A lot of the twists I NEVER saw coming - and i'm usually pretty good at figuring that kind of thing out!
The background music was probably what I found most "Hitchcock-like".  Take a listen to it and then watch say, Psycho, or Vertigo!
Not giving any specific recommendation (I never do that) but if you have the time and inclination, give it a chance.  You can't go wrong with Langella and crew.
