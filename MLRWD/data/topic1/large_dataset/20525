Sometimes short is best, so I' m not gonna write a long extended review.One of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen in my life.It is everything that a romantic comedy should be, and it doesn't get too predictable, like most romantic comedies, where you can just tell what will be said next.It's not like that in this one. It's charming without trying too hard, sentimental, and actually SINCERE, not overly gushy, and funny, without being cheesy.The acting is perfect, and I really couldn't find one thing to complain about, everything flows together.Ashely is brilliant.She's the future of female acting in Hollywood(along with Renne Zellwegger), and proves that she is a comedian.Hugh Jackman is just wonderful, not to mention sexy as freakin hell.I am in love.and Greg Kinnear, and Marisa Tomei are fabulous as well.This movie is reccomended to anyone who wants to enjoy great comedy.I'm not bulls**tting ya.Don't listen to people who write this off as another annyoing chick flick.It may not revolutionize in cinema, but it sure as hell does show us that there are still filmmakers out there willing to create a romantic comedy with some imagination.
