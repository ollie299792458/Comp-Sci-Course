As an owner of the original "welfare" DVD version of this film, I was very impressed with this special edition. Not only were there *tons* of extras and plenty of commentary by all the living Pythons, the quality of the feature itself was absolutely stunning! For those who know the movie and have only seen the other home versions of the film, the scene with Dennis the Peasant is the first real shock in this edition. The grass is *so* green! I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this movie was cleaned up so well. Even the people who have "sh!t all over them" look clean.
Unlike many of the other reveiwers of this movie, I didn't experience any difficulties with the subtitles at any point during the feature. On the subject of subtitles, someone had some fun going back and subtitling it with a farcical Shakespearean play for "people who don't like the movie." It is truly a great treatment of one of the best satirical films of all time. This is not just a Special Edition, it's a SPECTACULAR Edition!
