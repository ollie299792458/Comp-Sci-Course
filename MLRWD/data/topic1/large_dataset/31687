This movie is awful.  I you are under the age of 10 you may be able to deal with the historical mistakes and convenient coincidences, but otherwise this movie's soft plot will make you cringe.  First of all, conflict is created in the movie when a damaged Allied bomber happens to drop its payload on our heroin's safe house.  Coincidentally, she happens to be talking with a man with a sailboat at the time who is happy to help her escape to his farm with no regard for the risk to him and his family.  Soon afterward she escapes a Nazi ambush on a barge that results in the death of her family.  Although the Germans see her leap into the water they do not really pursue her and she swims away.  Somehow she connects with the resistance (it is never really explained how a wet fugitive in occupied Holland is able to evade the Nazis, find dry clothes, avoid observation and conveniently connect with the resistance).  Soon afterward a halftrack full of armed German troops surprises the resistance team.  Although the group is completely surprised they are able to overpower the troops (and their armored halftrack) and kill them all with no injuries to themselves.  They then decide that the troops "must have been working on their own" and that there is no need to worry about more Nazis.  It is never explained nor do they explain how they conveniently get rid of the troops and the halftrack.  There also seem to be no repercussions as a result of these missing troops.  Our heroin then goes on to find a Gestapo officer who is lonely and sympathetic to her hardships.  I could go on and on regarding the ridiculousness of this movie, but I think I have made my point.  For those looking for a good WW2 era suspense movie I would suggest "Eye of the Needle" or "Enigma".  This one is a loser.
