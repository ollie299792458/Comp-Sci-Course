Well, I just found this movie again after years of thinking about it wondering if i'd ever see it again in my life. Granted, revisiting something from my youth did have some nostalgia attached to it, and perhaps it isn't as great a movie as I remembered, but it's still a 'classic' of sorts in my opinion.
If I were a closet martial arts wannabe, I would find a lot of fault with this flick (as some of the '1 star review crew' have done), but I'm comfortable enough with my own ability to not have to point out every flaw with the fighting or plausability of people's performances. It was never intended as an instructional movie, so don't watch it in the hope of learning how to be the 'best of the best.'
But all that aside, the movie is in my opinion well acted with a good script for this genre. The characters are well thought out; I have seen many martial arts movies where the characters are about as well thought out and as deep as the chairs that are used to break over people's heads. This movie is a little better than that, but alas it will always be a cult martial arts flick.
I think it's better than any of Chuck Norris' offerings for instance, and perhaps even gives Steven Segal a run for his money when it comes to fight choreography, and the cheesiness that people seem so upset about is no more than you'd find in a late '80's movie of this genre.
Worth a look at. All those 1 star reviews made me laugh about as much as the parts in this flick that make it likeable.
