Based on a story about the urban legend of organ theft, KOMA is a nonstop, tautly-written thriller that covers just about every negative, ugly human emotion in the book! Jealousy, insecurity, betrayal, lust, deceipt, manipulation, and fear push the characters to the edge. Minds and mettle are tested and allegiances are formed and broken quickly.

From the first frame, the pace of this movie does not let up. The characterizations are fantastic and built less with dialouge than with action, physical reactions, face shots, and other wordless communication. The camera work is gorgeous: eerie, at times aggressive, modern, stark, cold. There is a fair amount of gore in this film: blood, physical pain; what the film lacks in gore, it makes up for in the sick, calculating thoughts of its depraved protagonist.

This is real dystopian psychological horror! A great entry in the J-horror canon, this is not a film for the squeamish, but for those who like to explore the underbelly of human emotion and the dark thoughts and actions a mind betrayed can go to, then KOMA will not disappoint!
