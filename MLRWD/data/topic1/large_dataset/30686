THE KING OF QUEENS-THE COMPLETE SERIES: Taking its cue from THE HONEYMOONERS, one of the most influential TV sitcoms ever, THE KING OF QUEENS features stand-up comic KEVIN JAMES as RALPH CRAMDEN-like lovable loser DOUG HEFFERNAN, only instead of a bus driving boob from the Bronx, he's a package delivery schlub from Queens. In the role of the smarter, wise-cracking spouse is LEAH REMINI, updated in this case to be as venomous as she is voluptuous. Astutely cast in the "wacky neighbor" role is the showbiz veteran's veteran JERRY STILLER, as Doug's cellar-dwelling father-in-law with a COSMO KRAMER-esque scheme for anybody who will lend an ear. Stiller's brilliantly wacked-out ARTHUR SPOONER is an even more twisted, indescribably annoying, (and even funnier) variation on his FRANK COSTANZA character from SEINFELD. JAMES lets the food/fat jokes fly with alarming regularity, CARRIE HEFFERNAN is the most despicable/lovable female creation since ELAINE BENNIS (Seinfeld again), and a book of Arthur's off the wall quotes would set the moral majority on its keister...with laughter, most likely. That's what great comedy is all about folks, and THE KING OF QUEENS is the best of its ilk since EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND. Hell, maybe even since THE FLINTSTONES, no stranger to the influence of THE HONEYMOONERS itself.

RATING: FIVE SPECIAL DELIVERIES
