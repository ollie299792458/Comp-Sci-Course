It's downright disturbing how "Duck Soup" ultimately bombed in the theaters upon it's initial release. Over half a century later, new audiences have finally realized the sheer brilliance and downright brutal nature this film has to offer. It is perhaps one of the few Marx Bros. films that has aged little regarding it's universal message and heart-felt presentation, recognizing themes of oppression, anti-war ideals, injustice, greed, etc. and injecting such with biting humor. In addition, "Duck Soup" offers no serious romantic subplots or musical interludes, just pure comedy! 
From the production aspect, Duck Soup also shines. Fantastic, albiet long dolly sequences of physical and verbal comedy spread throughout the work never miss a beat. Such scenes, like the mirror sequence, must have been hell on the crew as well as the actors, and the final result is a very entertaining, very majestic classic which parallel's even the finest pictures regardless of genre. As I have been known to say, "Well's Citizen Kane, Brunuel's Un Chein Andalou, and McCarey's Duck Soup". . . Wonderous!
