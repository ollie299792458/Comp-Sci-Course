I won't go over the story again, enough people before me have done this.  Suffice it to say that as a grandmother myself, albeit younger than May/Anne Reid, my overriding feeling when watching this movie was a depressing sense of betrayal.  Why was this woman so disliked by her children?  At first I didn't understand it; after all she was only trying to be nice. But as the film unfolded it became clear that everything was about May, not about anyone else.  Her ultimate act of betrayal, to sleep with Darren, hardly dented her feelings of guilt at all.  She was happiest when it was going on, and felt no remorse.  After Paula had hit her and she went home, she showed no after effects except loneliness that she was on her own again , and set out on holiday the next day with a spring in her step. At no time did she even consider what her daughter might be feeling.

What message does this film bring besides being a self indulgent sexually charged gazing at several navels?  That it is OK to betray your children for your own purposes so long as you "need it."

I don't think so.
