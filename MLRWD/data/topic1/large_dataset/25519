[...]. The Marxist radicals are portrayed sympathetically while the nuns at the girls private school are portrayed as cold and rigidly authoritarian, the usual stereotype of the Church representer of moral absolutes. Intended or not, the willingness of Annas mother to lie (about having had an abortion)to further her moral relativistic agenda highlights a fundamental flaw of collectivism/Marxism/progressivism/communitarianism, etc. And we are currently seeing that same willingness on the part of collectivist "watermelons" in advancing the AGW scam. The ends do not jusify the means. The ending scene of the movie is very telling: Anna goes to a new school, leaving the structured Catholic school she has attended. She enters the new school and all is chaos, kids shouting running and playing. Anna stands in confusion for a few moments, then joins the collective, playing with them. What are they learning? What is the point of the chaos and lack of structure? The true lesson of statist schooling: the lesson is to JOIN, to assimilate, to become part of the borg or be outcast. Anna is a human sacrifice to the state god, becoming herd animal rather than fully human.
