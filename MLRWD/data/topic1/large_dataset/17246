From the first episode, the cast of Sunny makes it known that they're pulling out all the stops when it comes to making us laugh. Whether it's exploring the many facets of abortions, gays, racism, dead guys, blowing buildings up, or even running each other over with cars, there's nothing too extreme for the crew from Paddy's Pub.

I think what makes the show so great is the relationship between the cast. The three male stars are all friends in real life, so their chemistry flares on screen together. Kaitlin Olsen blends perfectly in with the trio as well, and her character Sweet Dee and Glenn Howerton's Dennis are so geniune, I'd think they were twins in real life as well.

With the introduction of Danny DeVito as Sweet Dee and Dennis's insane father in the Second Season, the antics simply keep getting out-of-control without straying too far from the spectrum of believability. Every show continues to grow funnier and funnier, and by the time you reach the last episode ("Dennis and Dee Get a New Dad"), you'll be begging for more.
