The Chimneys of Green Knowe, published in the U.S. as The Treasure of Green Knowe, is the most dramatic and tightly-written of Lucy M. Boston's spooky, atmospheric books for young people. Julian Fellowes, who created Gosford PArk and later Downton Abbey,  wrote and directed this respectful, affectionate adaptation. Like the screen-writer of the first Narnia movie, Fellowes added war-related tension to his framing story. In this case, the new material works well to define the characters and give their story some much-needed forward motion.

The acting is uniformly superb, from Maggie Smith and Timothy Spall to the trio of children who carry much of the story. The costumes are gorgeous, and the ancient home on which the Green Knowe books are centered is well-represented by an actual stately home.

This movie is not the funny, ribald preteen fare that American movie-makers usually provide, but it should appeal to families who enjoy more thoughtful child-centered stories such as Hugo and The Secret of Roan Inish.
