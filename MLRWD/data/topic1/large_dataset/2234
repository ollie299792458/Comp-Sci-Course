If you are very familiar with the life of St Francis of Assisi you might be a little (or even a lot) frustrated with this film. No, it is definitely not historically accurate. What it IS, is a very calming film which tries to tell the story of a very young man who gave up all of the riches from his family so he could live out his Calling from God. There is no question that the entire film was influenced by the late 1960s "hippy" or "Flower Child" movement going on. (Make love, not war). But it depicts a man being extremely counter cultural which is exactly how the late Pope John Paul II asked us all to live. Not that all of us are asked to live in real poverty, but that we listen to where God calls us to be in life. St Francis is a bit unrealistic in some ways, it shows him singing and only interested in the butterflies and flowers in his young days. It may not translate well to today's audiences but for me being in my 50s, I enjoy the music and the beautiful cinematography. I also see it as a calming, soothing film. If you want to know the more historical life of St Francis, I suggest you check out your local Catholic bookshop and find some good printed material. I also would suggest a film called "Francis and Clare" which is more accurate of the lives of Francis and Clare. It's not perfect but definitely based on more factual accounts. But with that film being about 3 hours long, I find it harder to sit through. It's not exactly an action packed, suspenseful movie. Anyway, I enjoy this film for what it is and I'm a little disappointed in the review that Amazon wrote for it. If you can watch it with a mindset of late 60s and early 70s, then it might help you with the storyline. It's similar to how "Godspell" and "Jesus Christ Superstar" were influenced by the world situation at the time. I hope that you will enjoy it like I do.
