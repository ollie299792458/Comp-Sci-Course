I really enjoyed Dracula 2. I was quite surprised to see it being given a low rating for various reasons including it being insensitive to albinos. The idea that vampires are sensitive to light, or weaker in the light, is not intended to be an attack on albinos. It's meant to make them scary because creatures of the night who hunt their prey in the dark are great stuff for scary stories. These type of night creatures can see in the dark. Humans can't. Humans have always been afraid of the unknown and of what might be lurking in the dark. Vampires also have a more human appearance and a more vampiric appearance. The more vampiric appearance looks more corpse like and bloodless. This is in no way an attack on albinos. Vampires (like other magical creatures in legends) also have cumpulsions that drive them. It could be drinking human blood, making or repairing shoes, exchanging money for human teeth, counting things, collecting treasure, eating people, etcetera, but it has to be something extreme since magical creatures in these extreme stories are often extreme characters in some way. Having these type of ideas featured in a modern film is in no way an attack on people with compulsive disorder. Maybe folks who live in the country should be offended that Leatherface does too? Here's an idea: why don't we just enjoy movies like Dracula 2 and not try to be soo serious about them? Sounds good to me.
