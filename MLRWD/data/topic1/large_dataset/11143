I'll admit it, I'm a fantasy/comic book junkie.  Hey, that's okay, comic books are now in style and it seems as if a comic book movie is coming out every other month, with a fantasy movie coming out in the months between.  Having said that, I will also say I don't like a movie because it fits that criteria.  Two examples would be "Hellboy" and "Daredevil"...two movies which could have been better but were unfortunately lacking.  This all leads me to "Sin City".  This movie is amazing.  You either love it or you hate it, I guess.  I loved it.  It combines film noir with a very comic book feel, and extremely true to the original Frank Miller graphic novels.  A great cast in a very well filmed and written movie.  Robert Rodriguez is amazing, and his talents are put to the test here.  The recut, extended, unrated DVD is also amazing.  I'm not going to admit that I (cough) pirate movies, but my normal DVD attitude is "why buy the cow..."  Well folks, this is a cow worth buying.  If you loved the movie, you'll love the DVD.  It has too many extras to name them all, but they're all worth it.  You get to see all 4 stories as they were originally meant to be AND the way it was released in theatres AND in a green screen version that lets you see what was real and what was CGI AND with an optional audio track from the premiere audience that saw this movie...not to mention tons of interviews with cast and crew.  This is the reason to buy a DVD!
