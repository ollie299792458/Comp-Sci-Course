Based on a novel by DEATH WISH creator Brian Garfield, DEATH SENTENCE travels through some of the same territory but cuts it's own different path thanks to the wintry direction of James Wan (SAW) and a compelling lead performance from Kevin Bacon. The story even occasionally deviates from the standard revenge story by addressing the physical and psychological burden of taking the law into your own hands. Bacon plays a successful corporate executive whose rising hockey star son gets killed by a gang in the midst of a gas station stick-up and finds that the legal system is reluctant to do anything serious about it. In giving the killer a taste of his own medicine Bacon incurs the wrath of the killer's even more vicious gang leader brother and his band of bloodthirsty marauders. After a series of tragic events Bacon decides to take his campaign of Old Testament vengeance to the next level. To quote Keanu Reeves in THE MATRIX, "Guns. Lots of guns." Plus a ton of bloodshed and brutality that only the director of the wince-inducing original SAW could deliver in high gruesome style (Wan's SAW cohort Leigh Whannell plays one of the gang members). DEATH SENTENCE is a tightly-paced hardcore violent thriller of the old school in the tradition of VIGILANTE and THE EXECUTIONER, and Kevin Bacon's credible transformation from a peaceful family man to a roaring rampage of revenge would make Charles Bronson proud. The unrated DVD brings home the gory goods. Highly recommended.
