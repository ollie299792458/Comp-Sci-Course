Mission Impossible: I is the first movie of the three mission impossibles and it is by far the only one worth watching.  True, the second one has crazy explosives and flying karate kicks but that's not what true espionage is all about.

Then there's the third one, the most recent, and it's more espionage than the 2nd but it too relys too heavily on explosions and big names to give you any real value as a movie.  This movie is the bread and butter of "didn't see it coming" espionage spy movies!

That said, I'd like for you as a viewer of reviews to check out the DVD reviews of this Movie and get more of a feel for what it has to offer, Here in the "Blu Ray" Review I just want to tell you whats improved or not improved, for that matter, on the blu ray version.  I currently have the Onkyo TX-SR805 receiver which decodes True HD and DTS Master HD audio formats NEITHER OF WHICH ARE SUPPORTED ON THIS BLU RAY DISC.

The best audio that is offered on this Disc is regular Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 which sounds great, but does not live up to the standards that are trying to be set in this next generation of home entertainment.

So I was disappointed in not getting the HD audio I would expect it does look fantastic in HD, there's a lot of contrast in black levels and the details in face shots are phenomenal but I wouldn't replace my Old Mission Impossible DVD with a Blu Ray Version (I rented it from blockbuster online to see the difference)

Hope this helps you as a consumer  Cheers.
