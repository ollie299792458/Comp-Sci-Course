Don't listen to the zealots, this is a great movie.  Many people believe that this movie "bashes" Christianity, Catholicism in particular.  Now, like Kevin Smith, I am a Catholic, and I was in no way offended by  this movie, in fact I saw it five times in the theater.  This is a movie  that shows the idiosyncracies in church dogma, just as every structure has  idiosyncracies.  The movie shows these points through an interesting and  entertaining story of good v. evil.  The overall theme of this movie is  that people should be more open to new ideas and to realize what Christ was  all about, love and understanding.  "Jesus wasn't sent to earth to  give us the 'willies,' he is a booster."  Finally, this is a great  movie, with great ideas and great dialogue.  I believe that it is Kevin  Smith's best work to date.  Matt Damon, Jason Lee, Linda Fiorentino, George  Carlin, Kevin Smith, Jason Mewes, Alan Rickman, and Chris Rock all give  very good performances, but Ben Affleck does a wonderful job as Bartleby. I  would certainly suggest this movie to anyone.  Faith is a funny thing.
