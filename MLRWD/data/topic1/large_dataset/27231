This is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen and I normally don't watch sitcoms.  I think the only people that would really like this show are dorks, which I'm a dork, so not only do I get every science reference, but I can actually relate to the characters.

The first time I saw this show, I was laughing hysterically and was thinking instantly, I can't believe a show like this made it to tv.  My next thought was that there was no way average people would understand it.  Judging by all the one star reviews, it looks like I was right.  The only thing I can do is hope that the show has enough intelligent viewers to keep it going.

I also think its odd that people would call the show full of stereotypes.  I went to an expensive university focusing on the sciences (a school full of pre-med and engineer students) and it was full of literal geniuses.  I hate to further the 'stereotype' as you nondorks call it, but this is what dorky people do.  This is actually what they talk about.  I know because I hung around them for years.  They play videogames, it's possible for them to be afraid to speak to a pretty girl, and they talk about nerdy stuff all day long.  It may not be interesting to you but trust me, its interesting to us.

For example, I remember back in school, one of my nerdy friends brought up, "I wonder how long it takes for a turd to be flushed down the toilet." (I'm paraphrasing because it was years ago)  He actually starting bringing up the velocity and speed and force of the flush.  His friend then brought in equations from physics and they worked on this problem for like an hour.

Anyway, my whole point is, this show actually hits a little too close to home.  I can't help but wonder if the creator is a dork too because this is a world only a true nerd could know this well.
