If your into watching a married couple bicker at each other in the middle of the ocean then this is right up your alley. I dont understand why this movie was so popular (they had a whole shelf of em at the movie store). Open water is down right a complete waste of time.

-first of all the movie is billed as very scary...no it s not. JAWS was scary the first time around, here you hardly even see the sharks and when you do see a fin or waht have you, there is no tension. I yawned and so will you, your better off turning off the lights and having your buddy tap the wall to get more of a chill

-secondly the acting and filiming is bad, it seems they were going for a kinda blair witch feel and I understand that, but please i dont need to watch the ocean go up and down, up and down, for a bloody hour...what, did they leave the camera floating in the ocean. the acting was terrible, there is one seen when the husband gets mad and starts screaming at the sharks, and you can tell buddy is trying way to hard and all you can do is look at your watch...

Well thats all the ranting this movie gets...boooo...
