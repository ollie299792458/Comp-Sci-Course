I was very pleased with the acting, especially Streep's. She had the same cold-hearted creepiness that Lansbury brought to the original. I was a bit dissapointed by the storyline changes. The original managed to both play on our fears of the insidious nature of the communist threat while deftly lampooning McCarthyism. I feel that the modern version was a switch in it's political view, changing the enemy from the communists to the capitalists. It tried to "balance" this switch by taking a stab at the political left, albeit with a Hollywood rubber prop knife.

Another dissapointment was the much hoped for updated dream sequence, that just didn't deliver. The first time I watched the original I was blown away by those parts, and kept thinking: "God, this couldn't have been made in '62!" It REALLY was ahead of it's time. I hoped modern effects and the like would have created something equally "trippy" for our time. A good, enjoyable movie, possibly ruined by my pre-conceived notions. Well acted all around, but the plot felt a little empty for me.
