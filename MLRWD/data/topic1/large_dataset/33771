A mother raising her family mostly on her own while her husband is at sea for long spells, in an upper-middle class cottage on the shores of Lake Taho. Her self-absorbed son has been exploring his sexuality with a smarmy older man, and Mom intervenes in desperation. The smarm has a few too many and comes looking for his young paramour at the family home, with disastrous consequences that plunge Mom into even more desperate waters. Then things take a turn for the worse. This film isn't going to be on your "top 100 of all time" list, but it is a savvy effort with exceptional performances from the leads, great direction and craftful filming, top-notch editing, and decent script-writing. It has the feel of early Hitchcock with better film, and you'll find yourself returning to it every once in a while to refresh your memory of the fine performances by Vilnik and Swinton at their best. The score is haunting, and the scenery is too, despite the natural beauty of it all. The movie has a polish that belies its low-budget making, and despite the occasionally contrived events as Mom faces her dilemna, the movie is most satisfying. If you enjoy watching "The 39 Steps" every once in a while, you'll not be going off the deep end when you buy this - it's not an action-packed comicbook extravaganza, but a darned good flick for a quiet evening.
