This is a very good show. The dialogue is fast and funny, the visuals are amazing, and the storyline is just weird enough to keep you entertained. It's not really one of those shows that you "relate" to; it's too fantastic and out-of-this-world for regular people. But that's what makes the show great - it's not supposed to be ordinary. It strives for extraordinary and far surpasses.

And even though the show was canceled, the makers still did a damn fine job with the last episode. It gives closure to the big storylines while still leaving roads open so the characters and the universe can live on in our imagination.

My one criticism was the character of Chuck. The writers didn't have to, but they basically made her into the Manic Pixie Dream Girl (look up the term on Wikipedia if you don't already know what it means.) Chuck's main purpose is to brighten Ned's dreary life - in fact, that's her ONLY purpose, because she's not even supposed to be alive! So, that's what the writers did. Instead of creating a three-dimensional female character, they inserted a trope. I suppose that was easier, and in a way, it fits the over-the-top style of the show. Kristen Chenoweth's character (Olive) is much more developed and unique than Chuck's, yet she is cast as a Supporting Actress - hell, her character was so well-rounded and so liked that she won an Emmy Award for it! So, that's my one criticism of Pushing Daisies. No television show is perfect, and it's still an excellent show that I would recommend to anyone.
