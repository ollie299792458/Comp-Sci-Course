Jennifer Lopez's character "Slim" is by no means a representation of an empowered female.  The film frames Slim in a way that boxes her into the stereotypical roles of first a lonely, low-income waitress swept off her feet by a charming, handsome "prince," then a loving, caring mother, and finally a "fighter."  The close-up shots of Jennifer Lopez in her tight, belly-baring training outfit completely segment her body and remove the audience from the action.  Instead of focusing on the actions themselves, the camera focuses on the body, forcing the viewer to act as both a surveyor and spectator.  Of course, Jennifer Lopez is infamous for that bum of hers, but how many times must it flash across the screen before it takes on a larger character than Slim herself?  This technique of segmenting Jennifer Lopez's body sends a message to the female audience that it is Slim's physical appearance that develops her as a strong woman and gives her the power to "fight" back, not her intellect.  Even though Slim breaks away from the abusive relationship with her husband, she is still dependent on a male character throughout the film.  First it is her fairytale-like father who supports her financially.  Next her new lover, Joe, supports her emotionally.  The scene in which Joe and Slim lie in bed together suggest that Slim is finally settled into her new life because she has a man at her side.  Finally, it is her male trainer who "gives" her the ability to fight back.  All in all, the film is a total flop in terms of taking on the serious social issue of domestic abuse and a woman's rise above it.
