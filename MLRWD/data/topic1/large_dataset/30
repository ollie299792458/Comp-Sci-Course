I hadn't heard of this movie before I saw it offered on Amazon. (That doesn't say much since I don't go to theaters anymore due to cell phones.) I was leary about renting it because of that but took a chance because of the actors' reputations. I am happy I did. I'm not sure what the people that gave bad reviews were expecting, perhaps a movie about true paranormal events, maybe. Loosely translated, it does involve paranormal events but in a team whose careers are in debunking such, and not in the head spinning around spitting pea soup way. This movie makes you use your mind and demands your attention. Watch closely, pay attention, and try to figure it out. Yes, the ending took me by surprise but I like when that happens because too many movies are boringly predictable. As the credits began to roll and I thought about the ending, it hit me: "Well of course!"

Tastes in films is relative. This movie will appeal to some but not all; it's the great thing about having different genres of movies, books, music, etc. If you want a movie that hands you all the drudging details on a silver platter and you can watch it mindlessly, no, this one isn't for you.
