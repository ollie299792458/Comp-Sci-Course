Finally got to see one of the most talked about movies of the year.  The widescreen edition is great and the special features are okay.  Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat, a native of Kazakstan and also a reporter from that country who comes to America in the hopes of learning something constructive to take back and apply to his own culture.  What the film really does is show a hilarious, if often times disturbing and yet comical view of American culture through Borat's eyes.  From his purchase of an "auto car" to falling in love with Pamela Anderson after watching an episode of Baywatch, it was fun to follow him through his journey from New York to California.  Cohen is great because he makes the character he plays very believable.  Whether it was the Rodeo, the Bear they bought for protection or the etiquette lessons, the film was highly entertaining.  This kind of humor is not for everyone but I know people who would have found some of it to be a turn off still ended up laughing a lot.  Borat holds nothing back and in the meantime explores everything from run down neighborhoods to evangelical church meetings.  At times I laughed so hard my sides were about to burst!
