Foremost, what I failed to recognize (and what many of the other reviewers who shredded the film failed to recognize) is that this is a Nickelodeon production (and appropriately so, rated for children). So if you are expecting another "Saving Silverman," "Orange County," or even "High Fidelity," forget about it!! There is nothing nuanced about this work. This was made for kids . . . and on some very basic level, it succeeds in being entertaining (to children). But there is very little to sustain an adult viewer.

The larger-than-life, thoroughly garish soundtrack will have the kids dancing around the coffee table (though you might find yourself praying for ear-plugs!) Jack Black is totally committed to his role as Nacho (which is oddly endearing) . . . his insanely "bad" accent is either insulting or funny (I cannot tell which). Darius Rose is charming as Chancho . . . an impressive display of youthful talent; hopefully he will move-on to greater roles! Likewise for H&eacute;ctor Jim&eacute;nez!!

The cinematography is surprisingly "dazzling" (to distract the viewer from the lack of story, of course). The kids will love the high-contrast (lots of very bright colors) and the slick presentation. You have to give credit to Hess for shooting a "good looking" film!! Still, (I cannot write this enough) . . . there is no substance here . . . AT ALL.

Yep, the movie stinks on SO MANY levels. But I have little doubt that the target demographic for this film (pre-teens) enjoyed it.
