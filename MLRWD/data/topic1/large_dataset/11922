One to note that this movie was recorded at a low volume. I seriously could barely hear it even with headphones. I don't know if this was coincidence or something to do with my service, but still ironic.

One of the things that stood out about this movie is how polarizing both cultures were. The hearing parents & grandparents wanted hearing kids & thought it was abuse not to give children these implants. And likewise the deaf parents & grandparents thought it was not valuing deaf culture treating it as something inferior.

I don't think there was a right or wrong answer just desires. I could see children growing up either way to be happy & functional.

There seemed no middle opinion. I don't know if the producers wanted it this way or it simply happened this way.

I do think it was very interesting to see both worlds & it would be a great value if more people learned sign language. Not so they could necessarily relate to deaf people but to understand a dimension of language that could make them more well rounded.

***Spoiler*** Also the vast majority of the movie was in sound. Only the last few seconds were without sound. I think they could have used this more especially when the deaf were talking. They could have relied on subtitles at those points. In this sense the film seemed more tilted towards the hearing. And just to make sure people know I'm being objective Ive had perfect hearing all my life.

Finally Id be interested in seeing a follow up documentary of both these children to see if there was any better or worse quality of life because of their parents decisions.

Personally I'd be wary of the surgery as they had to peel off half the skin on the one son's head. Also the anesthetic couldn't be too good for brain cells. Just something to think about.

Fortunately it seemed the results were pretty good. Hopefully well get the follow up & see for ourselves the long term results. I suspect at best they will be subjective.
