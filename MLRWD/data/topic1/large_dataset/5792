Watching this movie actually makes me feel a little ill, due to the fact that the characters, sets and story details are so REALISTIC. To see such characters as Mena Suvari looking so repulsive (contrary to her ususal american beauty as displayed in other movies) adds to the realism, because I have known so called "Beautiful" people who have turned up later looking and acting like these characters. Its almost spooky to see how one's lifestyle choices can totally change one's appearance & behaviours. The tricky camera work and extreme closeups just intensify the experience (though they do go a little overboard at times), and make the viewer feel as if s/he is actually there, experiencing it all. It is also great to see Deborah Harry reprise her Intimate Stranger-esque phone sex role too.
My creative writing teacher, back in high school used to always say that the object of the writer is to move the reader, which doesn't always mean to make the reader feel pleasant. The movie makers in this film do move this viewer, so, as far as I am concerned they have more than done their job.
