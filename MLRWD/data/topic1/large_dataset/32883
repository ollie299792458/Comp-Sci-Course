OK people, We understand!  Much of this movie is historically inaccurate!  So what?  It is a fantastic film!  If you want historic accuracy, get a history textbook!  If this film had been made with COMPLETE historic  accuracy, it would have been as exciting as watching The History Channel.  This movie was made to entertain - to sell tickets, not to show in a 7th  grade history class.  As a movie (and that's what it is...) Braveheart is  incredible.  Acting, action, epic battles, cinematography, etc. -- all top  notch.  Violent?  Yes, it is violent - that is the nature of the film.  If  you thought the movie wasn't going to have violence, all you had to do was  watch a preview, or glance at the cover of the video or DVD - A man with a  claymore standing in front of flames and a battle -- does this look like a  happy Saturday morning movie to take little Bobby and Susie Jo to see  because they ate all their peas the night before?  NO!  See the film for  what it is - not for what you want it to be.  Apocalypse Now was one of the  best films ever -- did I enjoy watching it?  No, it made me feel sick to my  stomach.  Did I appreciate the imagery and vision of the film?  Yes - It  was brilliant, one of the most disturbing and brilliant films I have ever  seen.  If a movie is good, then it is good.  If the movie is not YOUR type  of movie, see if you can appreciate the movie for what it is, not what you  would like it to be.
