Despite what Shawn Watson writes in his previous review, this is the preeminent horror/comedy!  Zombie girlfriends, chainsaws, possession, self amputation, flying eye-balls, and oh . . . that Henrietta and her fruit cellar!  There's so much to love!  The horror is slap stick and the comedy is gruesome.  So many directors have borrowed from the directorial style that Sam Rami perfected in this very movie!  Once you've seen it, you'll realize some of your favorite movies pay homage to this one.  Bruce Campbell is awesome and you'll be quoting his character Ash long after the movie ends.  IF YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR and are not put off by graphic horror, this film is easy to enjoy.  There are many reasons the cult following behind this film grows every year.

P.S. - There are presently net rumors that the next Jason VS. Freddy movie will include Ash from the Evil Dead movies!  Director Rami is in talks right now to possibly lend Ash to "Jason VS. Freddy VS. Ash"  The cult has gone main-stream!
