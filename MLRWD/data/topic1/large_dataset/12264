Supergirl has long been one of my favorite movies.  I'd catch it on TV when it was on and even recorded one version with my VCR.  But the one problem was that I was at the mercy of the TV channels, editing the movie as they saw fit.  Therefore, I'm glad that I bought this movie, the full 124-minute version, with all the scenes together, even ones that I don't think I had ever seen before.

The movie itself is great.  It's fast paced; it's inspirational, with a naive and scared teenager having to use her intelligence to save her people; it's got great acting, especially Faye Dunaway's inspired mad performance; and so forth.

The DVD contains the full version of the movie, as well as director's commentary--with director Jeannot Szwarc and historian Scott Bosco talking about the movie as it's playing.  It's an interesting take on it (particularly on the Phantom Zone scenes) and is obviously candid, since the director does embarrass himself a couple times.  Supposedly, there's also the theatrical trailer, which I'd love to see, but I can't access it with my DVD player (I'm sure it's just a problem with my DVD player and not with DVD itself).

Amazon does have an error, though.  Amazon claims this is rated PG; however, this version is unrated, because it's ten minutes longer than the PG-rated version.
