Sometimes a bad movie can be redeemed to be somewhat entertaining because how bad it is (for instance: "Cool as Ice" with Vanilla Ice).  Yet, Battlefield Earth is so bad that it is unredeemable, even if you're looking for a "it's so stupid it's funny" flick.  Faulty logic abounds and I fear that those few souls that would find this movie entertaining are the result of the decline in educational standards in the United States.  Most movies that are good require some form of intellectual involvement on your part in order to follow the plot or understand the ending.  Battlefield Earth uses this against you as you try to make sense of the entire movie, thus making it (possibly) one of the WORST MOVIES of ALL TIME.
In my opinion, watching this decreases your IQ by a point each time you watch it, so each viewing seems to get better and better as you get stupider and stupider.  Be wary: if you found this movie even remotely entertaining, you've been sucked into its blackhole of stupidity.  Most will turn and run before it's too late, but inevitably there are some that will be sucked in with no hope to escape.
