They definitely don't make movies like they used to... that includes martial arts flicks as well. But for a brief period of time they were extremely good. That was when Jet Li was at his best. Now the movies have too much special effects which takes away from the the plot, drama, humor, etc. The reason why we used to run in the house & anxiously wait in front of the TV for those Saturday afternoon classics @ 3 o'clock. Jet Li was the last to bridge that gap between that era & the new martial arts generation. Don't get me wrong, I think Donnie Yen has definitely taken the torch passed on by Jet Li. Fist of Legend for those who don't know was a remake of Bruce Lee's classic Fist of Fury. Not too many people can pull off a such an ambitious project. The thing about this movie that makes it special is the humor mixed with incredible martial arts, and I don't mean that Jackie Chan type of humor. Jet Li pulls off not only a worthy remake, but a classic in its own rite. Check out most if not all of his earlier films from the 90' s to fully appreciate what a classic this truly is.
