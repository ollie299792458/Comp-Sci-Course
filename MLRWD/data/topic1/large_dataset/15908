Master and Commander is a film based on the naval book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393325172">Master and Commander (Movie Tie-In Edition)</a> by Patrick O'Brian, featuring Commander Jack Aubrey during the Napoleonic Wars, as her pursues the French ship - Acheron.  Although it is based on the book, fans of the series should not expect a close film adaptation, as the movie is very different from the plot of the book (although it does retain some of its themes). Not only is this a great movie, but it is a fantastic DVD.  One thing you really notice is the outstanding picture and audio transfer that made it to this disc.  Even on my small 30" TV it felt like I was watching this in the theater again.  If you have a DTS capable DVD player, you'll really appreciate the Bruckheimer soundtrack.

The extras on this DVD are where it really stands out.  This thing is packed to the brim with extras.  And I'm talking about quality extras, not a bunch of "music video" or "upcoming trailers" fluff to fill up the disc.  The extras are all entertaining, and fairly lengthy.  The shortest one on here is the HBO First Look, which is still 25 minutes long.  I almost enjoyed watching the extras as much as the film.
