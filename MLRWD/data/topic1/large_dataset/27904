We saw this at the drive-in in a double with MI2 maybe a year after it disappeared all too quickly from the cinemas. Loved it and went straight out and bought the video (didn't bother with MI2). This is one film that can and should be watched again and again - there is always something new.
The whole premise is hugely entertaining (on several levels), and in addition to being a comedy, it is also a 'feel-good' movie in a way that doesn't leave you feeling manipulated. If you loved Batman and Superman, and grew up on a diet of super-hero comics then all the better (particularly when you think of all of the one-dimensional 'powers' that some of them had, and how difficult it must have been for the writers of the time to keep coming up with new ideas in an overcrowded market)
The performances and writing are first rate, and there are many memorable lines. The cast is brilliant : William H Macy, Geoffrey Rush, Wes Studi, Janeane Garofalo, Ben Stiller, Hank Azaria with excellent support from people such as Eddie Izzard &amp; Tom Waits.
Give this film the chance it deserves it, and you won't be disappointed. However, if you are the sort of film goer that can't stand silliness and prefer realism and logic, then you just won't get it and you won't like it.
