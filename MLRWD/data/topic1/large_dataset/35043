Although this was a great action movie -- probably the best sniper movie out there -- I didn't see any mention of this in all the reviews that I read so far:  This was a parable for 9/11, and the story lays out how our government was possibly involved in, if not orchestrated, the 9/11 tragedy.

[SPOILER ALERT]:  At the beginning of the movie, when Swagger (Mark Walburg's character) returns home, you see a copy of the 9/11 report next to his computer, which sets the tone of the movie.  Some of the defining moments of the movie are when the wheelchair-bound Checzk character lays it out there in his face-to-face with Swagger:  Nothing happens in any country without the knowledge and consent of people in power.  Also, Ned Beatty's Senator Meachum sums it all up:  There is no Sunni and Shia, Democrats and Republicans, it's just haves and have-not, and the haves do what they have to do to keep the perpetual war machine going, because it's what the people want , and it's good for democracy (according to Senator Meachum, anyway). Danny Glover's character (he's acted better in other movies -- Lethal Weapon comes to mind) is the ultimate behind-the-scene bad guy, and you get a pretty good sense of if the government was involved, how it might come about, through his actions.

If you haven't done so, go back and watch the movie again, not just because it's a great action movie (Swagger and the girl never hook up -- not even a kiss), but to see the big picture about 9/11 and how our government probably knew about it, if they weren't directly involved.  In the movie, it's about cover-up of massacred civilians in Africa to build and protect an oil pipeline, but in reality, it's all about 9/11.  Also, check out the documentary "Zeitgeist", which is an amazing work on piecing together the aftermath of 9/11, among other topics.
