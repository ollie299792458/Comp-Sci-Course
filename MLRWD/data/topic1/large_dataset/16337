I thought this was an excellent, excellent film. I saw it for the first time last night, and I was struck by how well it was acted and filmed. (It was directed by Jean Renoir, so it has his skill as a baseline recommendation, but it was exceptionally good.) In response to those who protest that it gives an unrealistic view of war and ignores its horrors, I would admit that perhaps some of the conditions were idealized (the prison rooms looked like slightly-dingy hotel rooms, and the treatment of the prisoners.)However, one should realize how different World War One was from World War Two or other more recent wars. WWI had a few decent reasons for being fought, but primarily it was about European countries seeking to defend their national pride and expand their territorial holdings. As seen in this film and "All Quiet on the Western Front", (and the poetry of e.e. cummings) many soldiers got into combat and realized that they were not that different than the men on the other side of the trenches. They fought for the ideals of their respective countries, but separated from the propaganda, your enemy could be your neighbor. In WWII, there was an obvious evil (genocide) to fight against that needed to be defeated, but WWI had mostly stereotypes to lend menace.
"Grand Illusion", like "The Rules of the Game" reflects the decline of the great aristocratic families of Europe that was occuring during and after WWI. Ancient families that had controled dynasties for centuries were left without the power they had held. The world moved on and left them in anachronism, a reality which Von Rauffenstein and Boieldieu foresee. Much of the film is focused on the universality of the human condition. It doesn't deny the differences between people, but it shows how the connections between people can transcend some of these barriers when faced with the reality of war.
