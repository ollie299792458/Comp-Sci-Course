So Grease 2 didn't have John Travolta's dancing and Olivia Newton-John's singing in it, who cares! It's still the better of the two by far. The original Grease bores me, I can't sit through the whole thing with fast forwarding through tons of scenes. The same is not true with Grease 2. I loved every minute of this movie, from the first moment I laid eyes on Johnny and the rest of the T-Birds (much cuter than the originals, even if they weren't as tough)and the Pink Ladies, (who seem more like what the girlfriends of the school gang should be, plus they actually look like teenagers) Plus the music of Grease 2 is much more catchy than the original. I watch the original movie, but at the end find myself singing "Cool Rider" or humming "Score Tonight" Yes, at times the dialogue was bad in Grease 2, but the dialogue was bad at times in the original too. In my personal opinion people who say that this movie [isn't good] compared to the original must be very closed minded, it's not supposed to be a continuation of the original, it's supposed to be a brand new story, and the actors carry it well, especially Adrian Zmed, who made me laugh as Johnny, who wasn't as tough as Danny, but the girls loved him just as much, and Michelle Pfeiffer who plays a great character in Stephanie. All you people who don't sing need to shut up about her voice and the songs she sang. Once you've sang in a movie musical of stage musical then you can be down on her, even though your probably not any better. And so, if you love music, and having a good time, then Grease 2 is the movie I recommend you see.
