I will not repeat all of the superlatives that have already been applied to this film or to the directors vision or the actors portrayal, they all defy description.  My only offering to this forum is time and space.  For a 3 hour movie it is amazing how time moves so swiftly that you don't notice it.  It is a well paced film that you can easily lose yourself in.  I cannot recommend it more highly than by asking how many of todays 90min hollywood movies would you wish to be 3 hrs long?  This film takes the full 3 hours and then when it is done you have no idea where the time went because you were so engrossed in it.  Even now after seeing the DVD version  7 or 8 times over two months I can still start it up anywhere in the story and be totally engrossed in the picture.  As for the space portion of my title, there must be a space for the DVD version of this film in any film viewers library that appreciates both world cinema and the origins of many of todays film techniques.  Along with Metropolis (science fiction), M (crime drama), and The General (comedy), Seven Samuari is a true cinema and world classic in every meaning of the phrase.
