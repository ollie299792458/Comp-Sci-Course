Frankly, we didn't care about signing before we watched this DVD...but now we're fascinated by it, and our 18 month girl just did the sign for "juice" and we're ecstatic. The thing is, though, this is a very upbeat video with a lot of footage babies find engaging such as of dogs, cats, ocean, bugs, food,, etc. It's an entertaining interesting DVD for any baby and also gives them a sense of their own capabilities and place in the world because all the aforementioned footage is interspersed with shots of very cute babies trying out  different signs with varying degrees of success. The mood is very cheerful and Rachel his a terrific guide. The music, which appears to be original, is very good too. BTW, we also got "My B<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KJJHI">My Baby Can Talk - First Signs</a> and like it, but not as much as this one.

Update hundreds of viewings later:

This is hands down--or up!--the best DVD for babies. Period. As in: there is no DVD our baby enjoys more. We don't particularly care about signing--she just loves it. And we love it too. After having watched it about a gazillion times--by popular demand of our baby--I don't see a single flaw or weak moment in it. It totally shines, has gotten us really interested in signing, and even has greater artistic value: when I view it it gives me a perspective on what it means to be a mother than is hard to come by in the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The footage is heartwarming, the music is far above average, Rachel the host is fantastic, the camera work is first-rate. They really have captured some special moments. This DVD is a total winner and I would recommend it for everyone who has a baby. Fifty stars!
