This film is a fitting tribute to the "Talvisota." I have a personal connection - my father was among those on the front lines, those that the movie depicts. He was one of TWO men to survive from his unit, and while he didn't like to speak of the war, the movie was extremely accurate from the accounts my father did share. As for the ending, I noted one of the reviewers didn't "get it." My dad said that one day they were shooting at each other, and the next they were fishing together. So, yes, the brutal combat ended in the blink of an eye, as soon as word came. Neither the young Finns nor the young Russians wanted to be there, they were just serving their respective countries.

As for the subtitles, I speak fluent Finnish, so I enjoyed the movie immensely. My husband, who is not fluent, wasn't particularly taken with the translation, so I translated for him and he enjoyed it more. All in all, though, I thought this was a fitting tribute to the young Finns who sacrificied their lives, and their youth - as my father did - to serve in the front lines and defend their country. Most importantly: KNOW YOUR HISTORY - FINLAND IS THE ONLY COUNTRY TO EVER REPAY ITS WAR DEBT TO THE UNITED STATES.
