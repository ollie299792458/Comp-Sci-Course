First off all, I don't even remember Bruce Campbell in the movie, but if he was, so what?  Honestly, what is with these Bruce Campbell junkies?  Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed The Adventures of Brisco County Jr and wish it continued, but the fact that he had a small part in this movie doesn't really matter.

I'm a time travel junkie.  I love stories about time travel.  And almost every movie or novel gets it wrong by involving impossible paradoxes.  This movie didn't.  For that it gets an automatic 3 stars.

The plot is the dad from The Waltons comes back in time and warns JFK and RFK about JFK's upcoming untimely death.  A lot of the movie is spent dealing with their need to be convinced that this is for real.  However, once convinced, can they actually stop it from happening?

I don't want to give too much of the plot away, other than to say, I liked the follow up after the immediate issues are dealt with.  I enjoyed finding out what happened to the then young future time traveller in a few year's time.

The actor who played RFK nailed it.  As I recall, the JFK actor did a terrible job.  Must not have been much budget left after hiring Ralph Waite and Bruce Campbell.  Would like to see again to catch more details.
