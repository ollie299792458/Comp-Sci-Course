I probably would not have guessed this film would be as good as it is. Though subtitled movies are not my favorite, I find that I like the original cast dialog better than dubbing and that was definitely true for this film. I found this movie to be fascinating from the perspective that it mixed modern society - in a place I know little about - with the age old battle of politics, power, money and corruption. I was drawn into the story and really felt like I was seeing the story through the characters in their environment. I wasn't an outsider looking in, I was seeing the complex story unfold from the characters' view and it was not simply presented on a plate for the viewer to see.

The story was compellingly told with no gratuitous violence - that which was there was needed to tell the story. The acting was superb, all the way around. Obviously, so was the directing. The story continuously flowed, at no time does the movie drag along.

Technically the cinematography/video, the sound track and the acting and locations were magnificent. Overall, I found a lot to like and it is deservedly the highest grossing movie of all time in Brazil (so far, anyway!) Clearly it deserves its nomination for a Best Foreign Film Oscar also.
