I have always loved the Rambo series, but in recent years I've watched them and really felt that the movies were getting dated.

Rambo #4 is exactly what I was wishing for. It's much grittier than the previous movies. None of the dialog felt forced and there wasn't any of the annoying hokey humor that I disliked in some of the movies.

The only thing I would have changed was the too long b&w flashback in the middle of the movie. I felt they could have shorted that considerably or possibly even removed it entirely.

All action movies have tons of violence, but it's often not very gritty. It's often just a bullet to the bad guy and they go down. There is some serious bloody violence in this movie and I absolutely love it.

I really liked the way that Stallone played Rambo in this one. Strangely, I think he actually looks better in this movie than in the previous ones. In previous movies he was just a big musclebound hero. In this one he looks like a huge chiseled stone giant.

Some people think that action heroes should throw in the towel when they get older. This movie proves Stallone has a lot of action hero days left in him. I eagerly await Rambo V.
