This is one of the best western's ever made.When OEJ was released it was bashed by critics everywhere.If the film seems a bit cut up,that's because Brando's director's cut as submitted to universal was 4hrs and 30 minutes long.Universal studio editors took Brand's film and cut it to peices.Even cut up and incomplete OEJ stands a Brando's expensive,slowly made,masterpiece,loved by avid western fans,hated by studio execs because of it's price tag,and because the visual perfection and awesome cast of the film,along with the the excellant script,cinematogrophy,and a underplayed but riveting performance by Brando.. resented  if not doomed by the boys in the front office,who considered it excessive and over the top for a first time director.Critics were viscious,attacking OEJ as a pretensious,flop.That was in 1960.
  Forget that Kubrick was originally hired to direct the film,as well as Elvis to play the Rio Kid.Kubrick dropped OEJ because of script issues,Elvis dropped OEJ because The Rio Kid was a little too provocative for him.Enter Brando..he was willing to direct and star in OEJ.The OEJ project geared up again,Brando brought in some of his buddies,Karl Malden,Slim Pickens,Ben Johnson,Wally Cox and Katy Jurado,to play the various characters found in the rather long story of revenge..next Brando built an exact replica of Monterey city circa 1880.The Monterey set was expensive to build.It set the stage for over-budget spending that plagued the project from day one.Then shooting began,it continued at a turtle's pace.Brando the perfectionist came out,he re-shot scenes up to 20 times,which drew heavily on the already strained budget.The movie industry waited with attentive curiosity.Brando completed the film in August 1959.He edited most of the film himself.The final director's cut was 4hr 23minutes long.Studio Execs called it too long and demanded it be cut to about 2 hours,Brando refused any further editing changes to OEJ saying it was perfect and any changes would change the continuity of the film.The final cut put OEJ at 2hr and 20 minutes.The story line was altered into fragments of the original.It's modified slow pace made the film seem long and often boring.OEJ was the biggest bomb of 1960.The cast,thinking they were working on a classic,were bitter toward the Universal execs who had Brando's Western edited with such relish,the film was at times not recognizable even to some members of the cast.
 Actually,OEJ is a great Western,one of the best ever made.How can this be,in 1960 it was a miserable failure?When the word got out that Brando was going to direct a western for universal studios,and it would have a great cast,large budget,and the best technical personnel in the business working behind the scenes,everyone.. execs,reporters,and the public in general awaited the release of OEJ to hopefully see the film and Brando fail.It was released and it failed many of the attacks on the film were based on jealousy for Brando.Brando was a revolutionary actor who redefined acting,in doing so,he had rocked lots of boats.OEJ was the visual proof of"what goes around comes around".The critics of the day hated the film not because OEJ was a bad film so much as it was a chance to bash Brando.His talent urked the best of them.
 Roger Ebert called OEJ"certainly one of the best of the genre,with perghaps one of the best scripts ever in action cinema".
  Even edited to death,Brando had made a great film.Today it stands as a film ahead of its time."Every frame is created by a master director who learned much from the great directors of his day"
  OEJ has one of the best casts ever assembled in cinema.The cinematography is the best,the script is better than the best and Brando gives one of his finest,most complex performances as the Rio Kid.
