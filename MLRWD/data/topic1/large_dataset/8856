I first watched "Psycho" a year ago around this time of Halloween. My mom wanted to see it once again and was always saying I needed to watch it. She first saw it when it came out and remembers it well, especially the not coming in early signs throughout the movie.

So, we found it at the library and watched it on a rainy afternoon. At first I was scared because I can't even stand to watch today's horror films.. would I survive this one? Well the answer to that is a yes! My reaction to the ending was a big shocker let me tell you, I kept repeating the phrase "Oh my God, oh my God!" This is perhaps the greatest horror/suspense film in existence. Makes you think without being too gory or bloody or leaving you dreading bedtime. Which was a plus for me, I experienced this while watching "Paranormal Activity 2." Couldn't sleep/bathe without the doors open. Psycho didn't do that, to my relief.

I watch it again, and never once did it grow old, such a masterpiece for sure! Hitchcock and of course to the author who wrote the book are geniuses.
Anthony Perkins is an amazing actor, I cannot begin to find words to describe his performance as Norman Bates. It was a great privilege to see him at work. He really became believable while transforming into this twisted character. Janet Leigh and Vera Miles were also just as amazing as they too gave strong performances.

If you haven't watched this movie: watch it! I promise you won't regret it, plus you'll finally understand all of the references made in other media. :) I sure felt in the club with that one after watching this movie.

My generation (this one) should really watch this movie; they need to know about the classic horror movie that is "Psycho".
