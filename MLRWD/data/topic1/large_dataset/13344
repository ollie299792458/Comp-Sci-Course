Science fiction? Yes. Generic science fiction? No.

In this film adaptation (sort of), Carl Sagan imagines what first contact with an alien species would be like, given everything that was currently known about actual science and astronomy. Without giving too much away, the movie pulls it off magnificently, going through everything imaginable about the response to alien contact: decryption, mathematics, politics, military (US mostly) concern, religious fervor, some of the crazies, human brilliance and idiocy, and still manages to strike an emotional cord with the main characters. It doesn't attempt to guess what aliens would look like or their capability, leaving that unknown element as it should be: unknown.

It's not all perfect, there's some lack of elegance in some of the writing and dialogue, and the ending in the court room could have been tightened up around Ellie's experience, but overall it's imaginatively written without assuming anything, and makes great points about how human reaction and the value of "non-practical" fields of science, given the interconnectedness of all the different sectors.

Give it a look. Won't disappoint.
