Hildy Johnson has seen it all, and she has seen too much. She's leaving the newspaper racket, and is retiring from the big city for Albany, a husband and a white picket fence. But, her editor, Walter Burns is not about to let his star reporter fly the coop. Sending her out to cover an execution, she tries everything in his power to torpedo her marriage. But, no-nonsense Hildy is not about to be undone by Burns shenanigans, and only one thing stands in her way - she cares. She cares about her job, she cares about the common people of New York, and she cares about Burns.

Oh what a great movie this really is! I love Rosalind Russell's portrayal of Hildegard Johnson - she does a great job of portraying her as a tough woman who lets nothing get in her way, but yet a woman with a compassion that the men around her just cannot seem to understand. And, as always Cary Grant brings that lovable rogue quality to his role that made him a superstar. This is a great old movie, straight out of the true golden age of Hollywood. Do yourself a favor and check it out today!
