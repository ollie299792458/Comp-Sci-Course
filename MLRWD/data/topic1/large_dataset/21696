This film embodies the best of Star Trek, and the Original Series in particular. At its core, KHAN is about dealing with loss. With richly developed characters, and the existing deep chemistry and friendship of Kirk, McCoy, and Spock, this film is both an exciting yarn and a profound meditation. Playing on the Takeshi Maru "no-win scenario" theme, we are given two men: Kirk and Khan. Khan has lost his wife, and is willing to risk his life and those of his people in a quest for vengeance. While Kirk, the chronic "cheater" of death, must finally face the consequences of his past in the revelation of his lost son, and in Khan. The final battle-scene of the film plays out spectacularly as a classic submarine-movie type hunt, while the wise and loyal Spock must sacrifice himself to save his friends. Redeemed by Spock's death, Kirk gains new wisdom into our frail and mortal human condition, and gains new life in the "humanity" of Spock. You need not love Star Trek to find this movie great. Check out Star Trek OS episode "Space Seed" for the back-story of Khan and to marvel further at Ricardo Montalban's physique.
