Short version

Pros:
1) Many themes: love, lust, sex, infidelity, promiscuity, homosexuality, heterosexuality, war, death

Cons:

1) NOT IN ENGLISH
2) Too much focus on minor characters.
3) Too short
4) Only one, brief "love scene"
5) Characters are too underdeveloped, we know to little about them

Longer version:

Yossi & Jagger certainly isn't the best film I've ever seen. However, its somewhat watchable but certainly not worth watching a second time.

I felt that story didn't focus enough on the main characters.

The film is already too short in my opinion, only 74 minutes. It is impossible to fully develop characters in that time. It is like writing your life's story in only 50 words. Impossible.

I personally I felt I didn't know Jagger and Yossi very well, especially Jagger. So many questions are left open.

The film just stats at them being in the army and are in love. Ok . .  that fine but who are Jagger and Yossi? How, where and when did they meet? Where they always in the in the army? Were they both aware of their sexuality when they met? How long have they been together? Why do they love each other?

Instead of answering these questions the film wastes a lot of time on minor characters and themes that no one really cares about.

Certainly, not the best movie though not horrible. Somewhat watchable if you subtitles (yuck)
