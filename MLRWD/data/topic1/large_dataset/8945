This was a well-made film and even better now that it is on DVD. Watching airborne paratroopers jump into a jungle atmosphere was interesting especially since they were able to find a huge clearing to touch ground in with no one getting hung up in jungle canopy. The film showed an almost unrealistic battle as the American soldiers attacked a radar site. While it may have actually happened-that part for me was hard to swallow. The first supply drop into a clearing was suspenseful as I thought the enemy would be there to ambush the men when they went after their supplies and amazed that the soldiers didn't seem to look around for the enemy. I found the disintegration of the men's uniforms interesting. I got the impression the men were in the jungle about four days but the uniforms at the end of the movie appeared as though they had been worn at least six months but perhaps clothing does fall apart that quickly in the jungle. The gliders that flew in with equipment and men were an interesting aspect of the film. The acting was very good especially the night they spent on a mountaintop waiting to be attacked. This was a side of the China-Burma-India war segment that most people have no idea about. I'm glad there is a film, which shows some of that whether it is historically correct or not.
