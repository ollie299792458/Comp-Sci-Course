This set is the best birthday gift I've gotten in years.  Just posted a review for "Taxi" season two and both of these shows are so funny that it makes me wonder why shows currently in prime time can't be as good.  Okay, so "Friends" and "Raymond" were great, but I can't think of any others that live up to the quality of this stuff.

And if it weren't for Nick@Nite (happy 20th anniversary!) I probably never would've seen "The Bob Newhart Show" at all.  Doesn't ANY station or network anywhere still replay these??  Well, their loss if not.  But thank goodness Fox is smart enough to unlock the old vaults and let the public re-experience this stuff.  Witty stuff and so worth the low-low-LOW price!  Less than half of what my roommate paid for that "Mary Tyler Moore Show" set (Sorry Dale!).

;-P

The only thing not so good about this first season collection is the color is kind of weak.  Thought it was my TV settings but checked it out and nope... it's the discs.  After reading that a few others here noticed the same problem I don't feel so bad.  But come, Fox!  I know you're making a bundle on these discs so you gotta work on that for seasons two to six.

Last night a bunch of us popped in a disc and played the HI BOB! drinking game.  Got smashed before flipping it over to play side two.  YOU GOTTA TRY IT!
