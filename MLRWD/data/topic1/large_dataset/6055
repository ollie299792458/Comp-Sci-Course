What does true love really feel like? Is it a way to share one's true emotions with someone special? Is it the best solution to the emptiness that life in this world provides? And if it definitely fulfills one's existence, would it be worthwhile sharing it with more than one person, mainly if that person were of the same sex?
That's just the challenging subject the movie SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY depicts so brilliantly. Two years after showing how bitter loneliness in a big city can feel in the also excellent MIDNIGHT COWBOY, John Schlesinger shows us the uncertainty 'double love' can bring mainly to the people who have someone they love in common. Bob, who is the object of love of both Dr.  Hirsch and Alex Greville, seems to go through such an experience quite naturally and without the slightest sense of guilt. However, both the man and the woman who love him seem to have their emotions over a barrel and fear to lose him, although they seem to accept or 'bear' each other reasonably well.
The final scene of the movie discloses the doctor's emotional fragility at the awareness of being left alone by the man he loves. When he states that he 'was there for the cough' - a brilliant set of words in a context that depicts his fight to be happy, he sums up what living is all about. In a nutshell, besides the wonderful performances of Glenda Jackson, Peter Finch. and Murray Head, SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY is a bitter essay on human fight for love and happiness in spite of the world's environment, which grows more and more hostile.
