this dvd collection is awesome despite what the amazon guy (who reviewed it) says. i thought the characters where devoloped perfectly. there is no need to prolong the obvious. they tell you what he's doing and why he's doing it. isn't that enough? or do you like drawn out exhausting plots like akira? though there is some funny phrases in the story it does not at all have silly undertones. the crazy twists that are given to the vampires (such as implanted vampires and vampires wearing crosses) gives this set a unique feeling the whole way through. the only thing i thought was a little bit strange was the theme song for the opening and closing credits. it doesn't (in my opinion) fit the story. that really doesn't matter anyway since it's only on for about 30 seconds. another thing i loved about this anime is the english dubbs are excellent. i'm not one of those anime nerds that likes to watch subtitles instead of the actual movie and this will not disappoint those of you who feel the same. i give this series a 5 do to extreme violence, gore, adult situations and great animation / dubbing. enjoy!
