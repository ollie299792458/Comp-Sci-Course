Yes, this movie was ok.  It was cute.  Great CGI.  Well written story-line.  I particularly liked the documentary format.  The biggest problem I have with it though is my disagreement with other reviewers.  This would be a great movie for kids if they would have toned down the language some.  No, there is no cursing technically speaking....but come on, who wants their kids repeating phrases such as "crap" and "pecker-head."  Also, they went a little too far with Tank's obsession with is trophies especially the mother's remark about him "polishing his trophies."  A 3 year old wouldn't have understood such a remark, but they definitely would repeat it.  I have had so many people recently telling me that I should let my 2 and 3 year olds watch this movie so I finally broke down and did.  I regret that decision.  If your kids are older, and can be told not to repeat everything (like 2 and 3 year olds do) this movie might be fine for you.  I just hate that it's portrayed as a kids movie when its not.
