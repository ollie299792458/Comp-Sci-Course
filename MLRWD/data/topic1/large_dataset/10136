rio bravo is one of the great films of our time. John Wayne as the no nonsense sheriff, Dean Martin as his alcoholic ex deputy, and Walter Brennan as his gimpy frontier deputy. Anyone who has seen this movie will tell you that Martin and Brennan steal the show. Unfortunately vetran character actor Ward Bond has a brief appearance in this movie. However it sets up the interjection of Ricky Nelson. Wayne knew box office and was willing to put singers in his westerns, such as F.Avalon in the Alamo, and Bobby Vinton in The Train Robbers, and Big Jake. Some have said Angie Dickinson was not needed in this movie. It probably could've been handled by an older actress, say Maureen O'Hara. However Angie does all right. The script has moments of romance comedy drama and action, but the central core of this movie is the interaction between Wayne, Brennan, and Martin. Even the villans are high quality actors, John Russell and Claude Akins. John Wayne in this movie shows he doesn't have to dominate the film
