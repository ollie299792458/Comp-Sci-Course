This terrific 1964 film has finally come out on DVD.  It's been worth the wait.  Lovingly produced, directed and adapted by Michael Cacoyannis (check out his 1999 film of The Cherry Orchard, with Charlotte Rampling and Alan Bates, to see how versatile this director really is), Zorba is a kind of Never on Sunday story about a free spirit (Anthony Quinn's Zorba) paired with an uptight Englishman (Alan Bates's Basil). They cross paths on Crete, and there the story unfolds.  The stars of this film are many: the excellent adaptation by Cacoyannis; the hard-to-forget music by Mikis Theodorakis (available, thank goodness, on CD); Crete as backdrop to the story; the Academy Award-winning black and white cinematography, black and white art direction/set decoration; and, Quinn, Bates, Irene Papas and Lila Kedrova (Best Supporting Actress winner), all superb in their roles.  At nearly two-and-a-half hours, the film holds your attention because of all the aforementioned ingredients. I had the pleasure of seeing Quinn and Kedrova on stage in the musical adaptation (Zorba) that toured for a while in the 80's, and while I enjoyed it a lot, I couldn't help but think of how musical the film was in all regards, and how the addition of Broadway-style tunes pulled focus from the simple power of the story, which was so effectively captured by Cacoyannis and his cast. If I had to run out of a burning building with only a small bagfull of films, Zorba the Greek would surely be one of them. It's unique and ultimately unforgettable.
