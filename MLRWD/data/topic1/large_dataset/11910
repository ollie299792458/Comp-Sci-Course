I noticed that one reviewer felt Barry Lyndon was unsuccessful as a film because he thought Kubrick should have chosen a more regal personna for the lead character. He felt Napolean would have made a better subject for the  drama! This is ludicrous, it goes against both the intention of the film  and of Kubrick himself. The very drama that makes the film interesting--  and compelling-- is based upon the concept of a humble and not-too- worldly  Irishman who rises to extraodinary heights by taking advantage of a series  of unusual  circumstances that place themselves before him.  In turn, his  eventual fall from grace provides the film with the kind of intense emotion  that transcends his humble origins. Replacing Barry Lyndon with Napolean or  any other historical figure would not in itself make Barry Lyndon a better  film, I believe the fim's success lies in the extraordinary events that  take place in a rather ordinary man's life. With the superb camera work,  marvelous period settings, breathtaking scenery and costumes, and music of  the period, the viewer is transfixed, given a glimpse into the excesses of  the 18th century in a way that no film since has been able to do. Who needs  Napolean?
