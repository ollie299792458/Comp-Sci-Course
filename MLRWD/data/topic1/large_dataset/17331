2010 has been one of my favorites since it came out in 1984. I think this is a good movie or I would not have purchased the blu-ray so I'll skip over comment on the movie itself.

The blu-ray transfer is not as horrible as many of these reviews would have you believe. If you want to see a BAD transfer, check out the DVD of Outland, another Peter Hyams film from the '80s. Compared to that, this is the best transfer in the universe. Although folks have called it "grainy", to me it appears to be more like digital camera noise you get at a high ISO rating - in any scene where there is sufficient brightness, there is no "noise", even within the same frame. In only one scene (when they are discussing what HAL will do when they ask him to sacrifice himself) is Roy Scheider slightly out of focus, although the rest of the frame is in focus. Bottom line is that the quality of this transfer did not detract from watching the movie. I don't have the DVD, so picking this up was a no brainer - but I have to believe this is better than the DVD.
