Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) is a retired CIA intelligence officer on vacation and giving a speech at the Royal Naval Academy. He is a professor at the United States Naval Academy and his knowledge is greatly appreciated. He is with his family in London. Irish terrorists attack the British Secretary of State and Ryan, a former Marine officer, uses his combat experience and saves the Secretary and kills one of the terrorist while he is wounded himself. He is knighted for his bravery by the Queen for saving the Secretary who was her cousin.

The leader of the terrorists has Ryan on his list of people to kill as Ryan killed his younger brother and also testified against him in British court. The head terrorist, Sean Miler (Sean Bean), escapes from his convoy to prison and plans a mission to get revenge on Ryan and his family at the same time. And that is just the start of Ryan's problems with Sean Miller....

This is an excellent story and it is based on a book by Tom Clancy of the same title. I love Tom Clancy's books and this was an excellent story and a great movie. The cast of the film is very good and contains many strong actors who portray their roles to perfection. The movie depicts the fight against terrorists and how the CIA supposedly works to find, locate and eliminate them.

This is a great action film with some changes to the original story but it makes a great film that I enjoyed a lot. Harrison Ford is a very good actor and his role as the protagonist in this motion picture just makes it spectacular. I recommend this movie to you.
