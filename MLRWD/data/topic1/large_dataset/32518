For most people, the American Revolution is a remote, enshrined event.  There are the set pieces of Lexington, Concord, Paul Revere's ride, Valley Forge and so on.

But the war in the southern colonies was a far more vicious, partisan affair.  The Loyalists - colonists remaining loyal to the British crown were numerous and many formed up military units.  One battle, King's Mountain, was fought entirely between Americans, Loyalists and Patriots.  "The Patriot" is a fictionalized account  of events that occurred during this period.  Mel Gibson is a farmer, reluctantly brought into the conflict to save his son from execution as a spy by a very nasty British Colonel, based on the real life Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton, otherwise known as "The Butcher".  Their conflict is a portrait of the war itself,  compete with ambushes, burinings, and other atrocities.

The battle scenes, particulary Cowpens, accurately depict 18th  century rules of engagement, and the costumes are authentic, right down to the buttons.  The role of the French, whose alliance was crucial to winning the war is well represented.  However, this is an entertainment, not a documentary and that is readily apparent.  Mel Gibson is impossibly clever, noble and brave, and the fact of slavery is sanitized to the point of absurdity.  Still, this movie does shed light on a unique time in American history, and is certainly worth seeing.
