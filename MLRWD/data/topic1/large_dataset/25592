Cathreen Hicks, Chris Sarandon, Alex Vincent, Brad Dourif, Dinah Manoff. A pretty good horror movie with lots of chills and special effects. The plot involves a Chicago serial killer (Dourif) who is shot down in a toy store by a detective (Sarandon) and right before he dies he uses black magic to transfer his soul into one of the dolls at the store. A little boy (Vincent)gets the same doll for his birthday and after his babysitter (Manoff) is murdered, everyone thinks he did it. And once another murder occurs, the boy is put away for a while. But the boy's mom (Hicks) doesn't buy it and makes the chilling discovery that the doll is alive after all and its goal is to get revenge on the detective who killed him and transfer his soul into the boy's body. I'm really glad this movie didn't go straight for shock value with blood and gore much like The Thing (1982) and The Fly (1986) so this one doesn't have much blood until the final scene. And another thing this movie is good for is for putting the living doll into the modern pop culture and the doll itself, Chucky, is so entertaining to watch and is still a memorable horror icon since. But aside from Chucky, the human characters were pretty believable, even little Alex Vicent. And I also like how it's not a living doll story were the doll has a mind of it's own and no backstory of how the doll came to life, this time the story is focused more on the doll which is a nice change. The special effects on the doll are pretty good, they try their best to make the doll seem alive, and it works. The voice overall by Brad Dourif is done quite well. So overall it's a good, chilling, and not exactly bloody movie.

I give it **** out of ***** stars
*** out of ****
and 7/10
