STOP!  Thank goodness I caught you before you clicked on "Proceed to Checkout."  It pains me to give this such a bad review as I love opera on Blu-ray and would like to do everything I can to encourage their sales; but there is simply no reason to preserve such a dismal performance.

I think it was Caruso that said all this opera requires is the five best singers in the world.  Only Hvorostovsky comes close.  Though still somewhat light in timbre he seems to have developed into a true Verdian baritone.  Azucena is passable.  This is my first exposure to the Manrico, Jose Cura. He essentially has a baritonal timbre with no "squillo" in his high notes.  To me he lacked the finesse and the vocal splendor needed.  Villoreal as Leonora lacked the richness in tone and fluidity of line the part requires.  The conducting was slow and robbed the music of its drama.

In terms of staging, the concepts ranged from bizzare (the Count's soldiers doing a silly dance with swords while wearing aviator glasses) to offensive (the Count's soldiers raping Azucena).  The stage director seemed to want an intimate affair in which the principals get six inches from each other's face and whisper to each other.  Come on, guys--there's nothing subtle about Trovatore.  You want some great voices to plant their feet and give us some "can belto" singing.  This just doesn't deliver.  And someone needs to take Manrico out and give him a good scrubbing--would a lady like Leonora fall for a guy who is perpetually caked with mud?  The video was dark and the sound quality muffled.

I am not familiar with other DVD's of this opera to offer an alternative.  However, I will recommend three wonderful audio CD sets:
Bjoerling, Milanov, Warren on RCA
Domingo, Price, Milnes on RCA
Corelli, Price, Bastiannini on DGG.

For examples of how wonderful opera can be on Blu-ray, try Manon with Netrebko, Eugene Onegin with Hvorostovsky and Flemming, or Traviata with Gheorghiu.
