I saw this film in the theater at release and was stunned--It was the first time I had trouble sleeping because of a horror flick since I was 10.  I think the problem with the film's acceptance was one of expectation; the  gore content was minimized in the trailers and a lot of people were taken  by surprise and repulsed (but nobody walked out).  There is a riveting pace  and atmosphere to this movie that keeps you from looking away in spite of  the nausea in the pit of your stomach...the idea that there is a parallel  universe just beyond reach of ours where true evil resides, and that  technology exists that can open the doorway for you and I to experience the  most grotesque torture and punishment imaginable at the hands of  unspeakable beings, is frightening and played for all it is worth.  The  acting is superb all around, particularly Fishburne and Neil.
Comparisons  with Sphere are misplaced, which held my interest for at most by 45 minutes  wnd was followed by sheer boredom.  There is no comparison.  If you want to  experience  true horror and have a grand preview of Hell, see Event  Horizon.  And remember, "'hell' is only a word--the reality is far,  far worse!"
