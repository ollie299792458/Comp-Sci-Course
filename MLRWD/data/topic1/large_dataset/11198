I usually don't take the time to review movies, but this one was so bad that I made an exception.  First off, I must admit that I did not understand the movie.  Second, I'm not sure there was anything to understand, that is except for the psychology behind people who rape and the psychology of people that have been raped,which was made unusually clear. The acting is very bad and the story is very weak. The end of the movie leaves you with a hired killer waiting for the main character, Will, at his girlfriends house. Don't worry, I did not spoil the movie if you have not seen it, because this scene like all the preceeding scenes, do not make any sense.  The killer is so disconnected from the plot of the movie that it is hard to understand why he is even there. Rather than leaving the audience wondering what might happen when Will arrives, this movie is so disjointed, it leaves you wondering what kind of drugs the production staff where on when they made the movie. I'll sleep when I'm dead only served to drop my estimation of British films another couple of notches.
