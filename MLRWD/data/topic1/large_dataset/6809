This is the creation of the poem to engrave drama in the hearts of man, which culminates in the 18-day war between the noble Pandava princes and their scheming cousins, the Kaurava kings that decides the fate of mankind.

We see how free will and fait can co-exist. Notice that Krishna has an agenda that may or may not be that of the other players in the game. Even in the 18-day war every rule is broken every value is destroyed, leaving no difference between whom is good or who is evil, who is an enemy or who is not. As Krishna does throughout the movie, we see that the only way the Pandava can win is to use any means.

Peter Brook encapsulated the essence of the Mahabharata in a 9-hour play. Then the play was adapted to this six-hour visual media presentation. Visually and melodically stunning this presentation is so well presented that you hardly realize the effort that went into making this representation reflect the true Mahabharata.

Mahabharata literally means Great (Maha) India (Bharat), yet its meaning is the story of mankind, as one would see that mankind started in India.

There are other film and book versions of the story some better some not as good however this is a brilliant work and should not be missed.

In book form, I suggest as a good starting place "Mahabharata" -The Acclaimed new rendering of an immortal epic of war and destiny. Retold by William Buck.

Also, do not over look "The Power of Myth" -- by Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers.
