Pixar does it again! With nods to its parent company (with his pencil-thin mustache, Skinner is both French and a little bit "Aladdin's"Jafar) and Tim Burton (Anton Ego has the macabre angles of a Burton animation), Pixar explodes the animation envelope with this family-friendly film. Where the characters are still "cartoons," the scenery looks like film -- although a small blurb in the credits state this is "REAL animation -- no rotoscoping!" Paris has never looked lovelier, and the FOOD -- the title dish made me hungry, and the last film that made my mouth water was "Big Night!" (Search for the recipe online using keywords "Thomas Keller" and "ratatouille.")  The artwork is first-rate (wish I could make my hair as shiny and beautiful as Colette's!), and the script can be enjoyed by all ages, even though it never "talks down." (When was the last time you heard the word "elephantine" in a movie??) "Salut!" to the voice talents, too -- especially Janeane Garafalo and Peter O'Toole. This tasty 'toon is a dish to savor!
