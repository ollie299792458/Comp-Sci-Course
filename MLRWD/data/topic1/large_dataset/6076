Clint Eastwood's only Oscar is his greatest achievment since "Dirty Harry".  this is perhaps the finest Western in cinema history - and it's not from the 60's.  released in 1992, it won 4 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Director (Eastwood), Supporting Actor, and Film Editing.
  Eastwood is William Munny, a retired gunfighter who accpets a job to kill two men who raped a prostitute.  Morgan Freeman is Ned Logan, his old partner who accompanies Munny and young killer Scofield Kid to the small town of Big Whiskey, where the targets are hiding.
  Richard Harris gives a small but memorable performance as a cocky, over-confident shooter who thinks he can out-fox the law.  but the best performance may be Gene Hackman, who portrays Little Bill, the town's corrupt sherrif who rules the area with an iron fist.
  Munny and friends do succeed in slaying the two rapiers, but not before Little Bill captures and kills Ned.  an outraged Munny and the Schofield Kid eventually pay Little Bill a visit.  the last sequence is bone-shattering.
  all the actors in here are good, but Hackman's Oscar-winning performace is believable and ice cold.  this is one movie that is destined to become a classic.
