This movie was simply wonderful. My boyfriend was expecting it to be a cheesy chick flick, but it surprised him! If you can get a man to watch it with you (and enjoy it) it must be pretty darn good.

Some movies have co-stars whose on-screen romances just fall flat, but Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo were perfect choices for the lead-they had a real chemistry. Basically, it's about a workaholic doctor who is in a car wreck, and the alcoholic who sublets her apartment. The spirit of the doctor, Elizabeth, appears at the apartment not long after the alcoholic, David, moves in. It takes Elizabeth awhile to realize she's not quite there, and when she does, she cannot remember what happened to make her that way. She and David embark on a journey to find out what truly happened to her, and David falls in love with her spirit along the way. It was a little disappointing, as you can pick up on the twist pretty quickly, but overall it was a wonderful little love story.  Highly recommended!
