I caught this film at a sneak preview (the film won't be out until 3 days from now in my area), and I got to tell you I was very impressed.  I have seen almost every horro/supernatural film, and I like to say I can predict them all very easily.
The movie challenged me.  I had no clue what was going to happen.  Richard Gere and Laura Linney (who were so great together in "Primal Fear"), have great chemistry on screen, and it was a joy to see the two of them together again.  Richard Gere plays a Washington Post journalist who, after getting in an accident with his wife, finds his life turned upside down.  Winding up in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, he encounters a man who claims (well, I don't want to ruin the surprise).  Staying in town to research the strange claims that the locals have made, he finds an ally in  local cop (Linney) who explains that for the past couple of months, "strange things have been happening", with even the most upstanding citizen claiming to have seen "something".  The film puts you off kilter with its eerie shots, dark nights, and even the ringing of the telephone is enough to put your nerves on edge, because you know something strange is going on, but what is it?  The climax of the film was very intense, and I found myself with my knees drawn up to my chin (thank God for stadium seating).  If you want to see a different type of thriller that focuses more on story and atmosphere than blood and gore, then go see "The Mothman Prophecies"
