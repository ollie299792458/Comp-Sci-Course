I'm So Glad I read more than just a couple of reviews and got to see enough positive ones to convince me (once again) to supplement my Cream 2005 DVD purchase with this classic!  It sounds like some of the reviewers have never attended a concert with a light show, judging by the complaints.  This was the 60's, man!

Although I have a complete set of Cream albums, I've never had the privilege of seeing them perform live.  Fortunately, there was an unrecorded band at the same time that was at least their equal: The Munchkins, a.k.a, The Pound Sterling, a.k.a., The Munchkins.  Unfortunately, their guitarist, Craig Bolyn, is dead, and the one recording he did make doesn't feature his guitar.  The members of Cream are still alive, and their reunion concert DVD wouldn't seem complete without this point of reference.

The underplayed music of the 60's deserves to be heard, and this DVD is an excellent way to experience it.  Don't cheat yourself by allowing yourself to be put off by those who are too nitpicking about trivialities to appreciate and enjoy a historic concert that will make it impossible for you to sit still!
