Deanna Durbin's freshness, youth, and energy sets up the mood for this fun, light hearted movie.

She plays Penny, the youngest of three daughters who, in order to bring back together their divorced parents, goes to New York with her older sisters and tries to dissuade their rich father from marrying his fortune-hunting fiance.

In their attempt to separate their father from his future bride, they stumble upon two handsome young men who fall in love with the two older sisters, Joan and Kay.  (Note:  Kay is the lucky one who steals the heart  of the handsomest of the two men, Lord Stuart, played by a very young and gorgeous Ray Milland).

Joan's Beau, Bill Evans, tries to help the three girls by hiring an out of work, alcoholic Hungarian to play the part of a rich Hungarian Count so he can lure their father's fiance away with his make-believe millions.  But things don't turn out quite as planned when Lord Stuart is accidentally mistaken as the hired Hungarian.

Very funny plot twists, entertaining music, and an overall enjoyable movie!!  Highly recommended for Durbin fans and for anyone who enjoys funny romantic musicals!
