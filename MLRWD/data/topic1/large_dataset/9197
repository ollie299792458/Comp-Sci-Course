Bernard Cornwell is one of that rare breed of authors who are able to write convincingly on a broad range of subjects. Present day thrillers, the Sharpe novels about riflemen in the days of the Duke of Wellington, even an  ancient historical novel about Stonehenge and it doesn't come much more ancient than that. His more recent novels have been about the Saxons and very good they are too. But I think that the trilogy he has written about the Arthurian legends are certainly among the best, if not the best of his novels. Having visited the authors website he also believes they are the best books he has written.

The legends of King Arthur hold a magical attraction for many people, myself included and I enjoy reading about them very much. The tales of Arthur and his knights of the round table riding about in full and shining armour are of course a total nonsense and a more or less modern day depiction of Arthur. Suits of armour were not even invented until several hundred years after Arthur's death, if indeed he existed at all. But if he did it would be more around the time in which the Winter King is set.

Mr. Cornwell puts a more realistic slant on the existence of Arthur in or around the sixth century, and the author himself believes that Arthur was some sort of war chief rather than a king.

The last book of the trilogy is the continuing story of war. It begins with the failure of Lancelot's rebellion and the ruination of Arthur's marriage to Guinevere. The Saxon hordes, although subdued have never been completely defeated and sensing unrest  they gather their war bands together for one final assault on Arthur and all he stands for. However, Arthur gains victory at Mount Badon, but all of the promises he made are coming back to haunt him, after many years of peace and contentment.
