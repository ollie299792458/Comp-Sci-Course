I thought this was an amazing piece of work; much more like a feature film than a movie for television. In fact, the cast is one you would find in an indy feature: Jeremy Davies, Clea Duvall, Bruno Kirby, Robert Joy, Mary Lynn Rajskub, and they are amazing. Jeremy Davies is best known for his role in "Saving Private Ryan, but he was also great in "Spanking the Monkey," and "Secretary," and works a lot with Lars Von Trier ("Dogville.")You don't often see performances like this on TV.

The style and mood of the film is also very effective, really creepy, and scary as hell. Again, the photography and visual style are much more like a feature film. The cameraman is the same guy who shot the "Jeepers Creepers" movies, which, regardless of what you might think of them, really look good.

The film really gets you into the head of Manson, and shows you how he was capable of winning people over and getting them to do what he wanted them to do. Again, Davies is amazing as Manson... you forget you're watching an actor.

The movie's pretty violent, and this version is MUCH more graphic and bloodier than the version they showed on television. I don't know if they needed that or not, but it definitely affects you.

It doesn't really feel like a typical remake, either... it has a lot less to do with the cops and lawyers, and more to do with Manson and his followers. It's much more thoughtful and goes a lot deeper than the original, which I liked a lot (and is also now on DVD).

The special features are good; and the commentary is smart because it just doesn't talk about "oh it was raining the day we did this scene..." they talk in depth about the choices they made, why, and a lot of information about Manson and the case that wasn't in the movie.
