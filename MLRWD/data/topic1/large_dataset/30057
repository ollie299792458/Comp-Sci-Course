At the risk of sounding snobbish,  I won't typically invest my time on entertainment which is focused on adultery.  It's just one of a variety of subjects which maybe I wish to distance myself from being emotionally involved in someone else's self-destructive behavior.  That said, I don't shun the many artistic expressions which skirt about the intrigues of illicit romance to bring a viewer, a reader, a listener, a greater feeling for the dramatic effect of the story.  No one contends that a prose or a poem or a lyric may not carry & deliver a story line.  but even a still photo may reveal the aspect of a place and it's dramatic impact on the subject.

The 'great' paintings from Da Vinci to Vermeer convey an almost tangible envelope of drama into which a viewer may be invited to slip away.  'English Patient' the movie is 'great' cinematography.  Glorious landscapes, passionate characters broken by war, and artful screen writing all combine through a series of flash-backs with powerful spiritual overtones.  It's not just a sappy romance;  although, it includes a Sapper (someone who explodes bombs) who falls in love with a Canadian Nurse in Italy.
