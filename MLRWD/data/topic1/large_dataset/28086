Viewers more accustomed to the glitz and color of modern Hollywood may hesitate to purchase an "old" black and white film.  I urge you, click that button!  This movie deserves to be in every "Titanic"-lover's collection, as the book it's based on should be on their shelves!

The ship itself is the star of the film.  During the course of the film, we come to know the names and faces of the passengers and crew aboard her.  We see their fear (a most poignant moment: a father, holding his sleeping son in his arms, looking down at him, before silently handing him to a crewman to be placed in a lifeboat.  A moment like that doesn't need a sappy Celine Dion song for impact.)  We see their courage--Ida Strauss's famous reply to her husband, and the life-long affection between them, brilliantly portrayed.

We see the baffling, maddening 'do-nothingness' of the Californian--a vital piece of the disaster story, yet one seldom mentioned in many of the films made.  This film is extraordinarily faithful to the book it sprang from, a rarity then and now.  The director even had the author on set as a consultant, paying meticulous attention to detail.

This film isn't out to impress anyone with its budget, its effects, or the names of the cast.  It's not about anyone's ego or creative interpretation.  It's the story of the Titanic, told in images and dialogue, giving the viewers a glimpse into what happened on that awful night, without getting in the way of the history.

I've seen just about every Titanic film made, from wretched things like "S.O.S. Titanic" to documentaries from National Geographic, and I have to say, "A Night to Remember" is simply the best.  It's worth every penny.
