My wife and I both enjoyed this superbly acted, beautifully filmed period drama.  As longtime PBS-TV Masterpiece Theatre fans, we were pre-disposed to enjoy this kind of production, but even so, this film adaptation of a classic E.M. Forster novel was particularly engrossing.  Forster reflected his fatalistic take on a class-bound Edwardian society that was already crumbling as he wrote.  To American eyes, the hopeless affair of Helen and Leonard and the marriage of social and financial convenience of Margaret and Henry seem both very outdated and very poignant.  The romantic visions of Leonard, walking through fields of bluebells in his imagination while slaving away in a dingy London office, would seem laughable in an American setting but are perfectly suited to his time and place.  This is essentially escapist fare, but for us is much preferable to the sex-and-violence saturated escapism of contemporary television and films.  It's really a welcome escape from our culture's primary forms of escapism.
