What a rare treat to see a basically clean, low violence, satisfyingly imaginative, family movie! The lack of bloodshed doesn't take away from the movie at all - the conflict does have its "critical" moments - meaning it's not a movie that has no problems for the characters to solve; but rather, it's a clever, sometimes humorous look at what might happen if a bored genuis-type toymaker and kids' television show host were to have a devious, scheming assistant who had a plan (and who tries to lure the toymaker into the evil plan) to satisfy a bad guy's request for an evil army who would help him gain power while a couple of retired spies decide to get back in the game but haven't quite got the hang of things yet and get captured which leaves their kids to plan and execute not only a rescue of their spy parents, but a way to help the toymaker decide whether he wants to be a good guy or bad guy, defeat the toymaker's evil assistant and the power-hungry bad guy. A good movie that asks some good questions about the importance of family and that shows that not all bad guys are unredeemable.
