It wasn't the toughest of neighborhoods. These kid's had known each other since their first little league games, maybe longer. They grew up, with parents, whom were not the best of influences. Truelove's Father is an example. He is a dealer himself, aiding his son's illegal purchases. Later,Daddy keeps law enforcement from finding his son's whereabouts.
In the eyes of an alpha male, he had to be always right, with a way out of any situation. Truelove was above all,and acted so. He seaked a drug debt owed to him. His debter was expected to pay, or suffer for his inability to pay. With no money coming, Truelove, kidnaps his debter's  younger brother, with Truelove's friends,along for the ride.
The teenager is treated well, till the discovery  that the "Stolen Kid," will get them a jail sentence. The carefree fun, quickly sours, as an unexpected tragedy unfolds!
It is a shocking story, all too easily forgotten, and or ignored. I could only hope the young actors involved will bring this tragic event to life. The varying fan bases widen these audience ranges. Young people need to see this, as too many believe they can do without consequences.
Frankie's final scene with Zack leaves one with a sea of emotions!
