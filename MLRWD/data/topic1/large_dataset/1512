This low-budget cut-n-splice 'documentary' doesnt cut the mustard.
The truth about Iraq comes from the Iraqis themselves: Go to http://iraqthemodel.blogspot.com and other Iraqi blogs to get the real story. 
Saddam killed 100s of thousands. He killed  7,000 kurdish civilians, mostly women and children, in a single day with chemical weapons (Hallabjah attack). American intervention freed Iraq from that monster, and now is helping in building a free and democratic Iraq, despite the concerted efforts of the forces of tyranny and terrorism to stop it. 
A real Iraq documentary needs that context, ie, video of Saddam's torture ( Iraqis have his torture as a video but we cant get it here), and it needs the video of Nick Berg getting his head cut off by terrorists, and the video of Jihadists in Iraq using children as human shields because the marines wont fire back when they do that, and the mosques full of weapons and the threats made in the Mosques. It needs the quotes of the arm-chair idiots on CNN claiming 3,000 Americans would die in the drive to baghdad, just 10 days before Baghdad was toppled with far fewer casualties.  It needs the bizarreness of reporters asking Don Rumsfeld when the war will end. The depravity of Abu Graib mixed with the humanity of the many brave soldiers trying to help build Iraq infrastructure, and Iraqis who turned down money and help because they were threatened with death if they did so. 
And it needs the hilarity of 'Baghdad Bob' on TV saying no Americans were at the Baghdad airport, shown in split screen with live footage of American soldiers there.
Lastly, it needs an expose on the UN oil-for-food program.
The 'real story' is that one of the most justified acts of foreign intervention that America has undertaken - supporting both our values and our interests - has now has become the most vilified. It's an interesting story, but one you wont get here in this cheap one-sided video.
