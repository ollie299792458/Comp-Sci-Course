I floated between giving this 1 or 2 stars. I think at least .5 of a star came from Chris Evans, who is just delicious at all times. Honestly though, I really didn't like this movie. Anna can either be cute or really awkward and abrasive, and she fell into the latter alot of this movie. If the movie would have pushed the comedy harder (or maybe they thought they did :/), it would have turned out better, because Anna does better when she's being goofier. When you have a premise such as how many people you've had sex with, you kind of just have to go for it, and this movie kind of made it uncomfortable to watch when it didn't have to be.
Some of the meant to be comedic moments (i.e. the wannabe senator asking her to be the straight wife to him as a gay husband, and Jole Hale smelling his fingers *gag*) were just downright sad. The only thing likeable was Chris and his arc, which they managed to do pretty well. The time was also way too long; the version I watched clocked in at 1:45, way too long for a movie like this.
If you like romcoms and/or raunchy gal humor..don't even bother trying this to see if you like it unless you just want to stare at Chris. My library copy didn't work, so I spent $.74 at Redbox, and that was a bit too much for this, lol. This is more like a 1.5 star vs a 2, but I don't feel utter total hate, so we'll go with 2.
