Peter & Paul tells the story of the Gentile mission of the Apostle Paul.  In a number of places it really shines and holds plausible.  The scenes of Paul preaching in the open air markets and the persecution he endured make sense.  Also, Peter teaching a great deal to Paul about Jesus also is interesting and likely.  And of course, many events are right but unfortunately, in many places it fails to follow the storyline of the New Testament.  It makes no sense because the show is long anyhow and there was plenty of time to depict the events in the right order and give them the right due.  Plus, it not as if the storyline of the book of Acts is boring or requires any additions or modifications to be exciting.  At times I much enjoyed it, but the missing of the details and the re-ordering of the events just drove me nuts.

To some degree, the makers of this series has bought into a number of theories concerning the early church, particularly that Paul is primarily responsible for the shaping of the early Church and the Christian faith.  True, the Apostle Paul was the central figure in the Gentile mission but this series makes Peter very weak and timid, the account of Cornelius and his household being saved by the preaching of Paul is completely skipped over, and there is set up a false conflict between Paul and the church in Jerusalem that did not exist according to the book of Acts.

So, enjoy the good parts but be prepared to spit out the rather large bones.
