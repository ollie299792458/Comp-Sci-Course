I was very excited to to see this film, It was only released in cinemas here in Australia on  20/2/03, so my desire to see a DVD of the fim is a LONG way off. ps we have more 'modern' censorship laws, we have the US NC-17 equivalent relase.
In repsonse to those to find the suicide scene distrurbing, good. That is the whole ever loving point. This film is meant to be dark, in fact it is nowhere near as dark as the book. I'll be honest in the suicide scene, at times I just turned away. 
My personal favourite characters were Paul, Laura and Richard. All of the performances were brilliant, some more so. Van Der Beek really impressed me. 
The scene with the snowflake as a tear on Sean's cheek is a great one. There were a few times where I just could not stop laughing.
The only film that I have seen in the last 12 months that I have gotten more out of is "Bowling for Columbine", but they both get 5 stars from me.
If  you haven't seen this film, see it. But if you are easily offended, and can not deal with very confronting scenes you may want to think twice.
Bring on "Glamourama"!
