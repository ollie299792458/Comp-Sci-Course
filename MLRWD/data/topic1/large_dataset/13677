I applaud the earlier reviewer, Ramsess Gray from Fayetteville, NC.  Thank you for standing up to all the other so-called critics who trashed this movie.  I thought this was an excellent movie from beginning to end.  In his big-screen debut, Tyler Perry delivered big-time, no questions asked.  Darren Grant, Mr. Perry, Kimberly Elise, Shemar Moore and the rest of the cast were second-to-none in my opinion.  I loved each of the characters Mr. Perry played himself, especially gun-toting Grandma.  She was funny & very entertaining throughout.  As far as best picture and/or any awards are concerned, I think Mr. Perry should have as good a chance as anyone to win an award in some category(ies).  Also, in my opinion, Kimberly Elise should win something for her role.  And for that matter so should Darren Grant & Shemar Moore.  But that's only my opinion. The movie was very entertaining and it had all the qualities you could ask for in a movie.  It made you laugh. It made you cry. It made you happy. It made you sad & it made you proud, all in about 2 hours time.  I'm sure this movie is not and will not be for everyone.  We all have different tastes.  All I can really say is "watch the movie for what it is", and that's entertainment at it's best.
