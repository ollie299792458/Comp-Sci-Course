When I read the advertisements that Captain N was coming out with all thirty-four episodes, I was excited. I even pre-ordered my boxset in December of 2006. Well, unfortunately, you only get twenty-six episodes and they are just seasons one and two. I do hope that seasons three and four are realeased on to DVD very soon. Still, what I mentioned above about not having all the episodes isn't all bad. But, at least have lots of charactors in a show that deals with video games. For instance, The Super Mario Brothers, Toad, as well as King Koopa and his forces of evil, and the princess of the Mushroom kingdom if your going to talk about video land. Still, this isn't a bad DVD set if you love the classic Nintendo cartoons. This DVD set has no major violence. Lots of comic relief Thanks to Simon Belmont, and Duke Kevin's dog. You also get to see some comic relief from Egg plant wizard, "Kidicarus," and King Hippo. Mike Tyson's punch out." If you are a classic Nintendo lover such as myself, then this DVD boxset is for you.
