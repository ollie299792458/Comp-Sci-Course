Ms. Foster was ready to pack it in in the late 1980s, she starred in many films and did small roles in others and all of it in vein, the films played to empty theaters and Luke warm reviews (Hotel New Hampshire, Stealing Home,Mesmorised, etc.).  She fought hard to play the rape victim in this film and was told she was not "rapable" enough, she lost weight and showed them that she could be [assaulted] as well as anyone, that's our girl.  This is not so much a film about rape as about society willingness or non willingness to deal with it, even another women who was present and was on Sarah's (Fosters) side isn't much help, Sarah's tough exterior is a shield, she is broken and vulnerable and shows this, her life hasn't been great but look at the total lack of support she gets from her mother, she is more concerned with her boyfriend situation then with her daughter and her louse, idiot boyfriend (all of Jodie Fosters boyfriends are louses), Her performance on the stand is what won her the Oscar, "I heard someone screaming, and it was me" sums it up pretty well, she ditached herself as a means of survival. Jodie Trivia:  Watch the young man who testifies on her behalf and wins the case for her, he was in Freaky Friday, and I could be wrong but I think one of the rapists was her creepy boyfriend in Foxes, is that right?  Anyway I'm glad this film is finally out on DVD, it's been far too long.
