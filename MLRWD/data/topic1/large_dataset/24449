Bonnie and Clyde is a fast paced, very suspenseful movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Bonnie and Clyde meet early in the movie and start their life together reaping havoc on Texas and a few of the surrounding states.  This was a good movie, but definitely not worthy of any more publicity that what it has had.  I wouldn't suggest it for a Saturday night rental with a significant other, but it isn't that bad.  It especially isn't for someone with a weak stomach.  But, if blood and gore won't bother you then you just might like this exciting adventure of murder and mayhem.  The Barrow gang works together to create one of the most famous and biggest killing and robbing sprees too ever cross the state of Texas.  The chemistry between Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway is mesmerizing.  They play two of the best lovers that I have seen in a movie in a long time.  She is a small town girl, but she is not in anyway innocent or helpless.  He on the other hand is a big city man who has seen the world.  Mostly from the inside of a jail cell, but Bonnie doesn't care.  Nothing could ever come between them and their very strange intimate relationship.  It is easier to understand what I mean once you have seen the movie.  I would definitely suggest renting this movie, as long as you have a strong stomach and if you are looking for something romantic.
