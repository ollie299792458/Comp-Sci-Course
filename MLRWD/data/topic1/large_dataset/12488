I guess I tend to analyze movies too much, but the time of year was always difficult to figure out in this movie.  Thanksgiving in Wisconsin should have found the family dairy farm covered in snow, but instead it looked like the county fair in August.  Then, the two main characters go off to Denmark at the end of the semester -- i.e. December???  It should have been very dark, cold, and snow covered in Scandinavia at that time of year.  As it was, the young couple was outside in the grass having a picnic on a pleasant looking summer?? day, with Paige in a cool looking summer dress!

I would do it this way:  Place Paige in her jr. year beginning her 2nd semester as Eddy comes on the scene.  The holiday visit home would be at Easter or spring break, and the trip to Denmark would be summertime.  Because Paige would still have a year left of school to complete for her bachelor's degree, one could understand why she would get cold feet in the end, and wish to return and complete the first portion of her studies towards a medical degree.  In the meantime, Prince Edvard becomes king and has a very busy year, but can't seem to get the memory of Paige out of his mind. So, he returns to Wisconsin just in time to greet Paige directly following her graduation.  Their love has stood the test of time, she still being in love with him too, and feels much better now about going to Denmark, where she feels she can enroll in medical school.
