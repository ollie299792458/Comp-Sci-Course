I'm torn here because I wanted so much to like this movie. I can't for the life of me fathom why the studio brought back Tim Story as the director of the sequel when the first movie was such a flop. The result was predictable.

Let's see...horrible dialog, boring script, unfunny one-liners, wooden acting, sub-par movie. This franchise had SO MUCH potential. It's too bad it was wasted. Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis are adequate in their roles but I think there were several casting errors in the original movie, that continued to the sequel. Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd and Julian McMahon were miscast as Sue Storm, Mr. Fantastic and Dr. Doom respectively. They're not superhero/villain material. I just don't believe them.  And their horrible dialog doesn't help.

The saving grace of this movie was the Silver Surfer. Great CGI, modeling and voicing brought this bad boy to life. Like other reviewers said, he stole the show. But he's not in it enough and doesn't do enough in the movie to save it from itself.

Anyways, in summary I suppose this movie doesn't take itself too seriously but honestly, this is at best a superhero B movie. I hope this is the end of the franchise because at this point it's time to cut the losses. I can see that it's supposed to be a fun movie, but you still need some semblance of a plot and good dialog to make a good movie.
