This is probably my favorite movie of all time.  It's simple and beautiful, but you can read other reviews for that stuff. All I want to say is be careful about which version you order, because this particular one(the reddish box that says "Sidney Berger" at the bottom)IS NOT THE COMPLETE VERSION OF THE FILM.  When the movie was released, it came out in several different shortened forms in order to fit double bills at drive-ins, and the print they used for this particular video is definitely missing a bunch of little scenes here and there.  Video companies are often unscrupulous about the quality or completeness of the prints they choose to format, because if you've never seen the film before, you wouldn't know the difference. This one's still good as far as picture quality goes, but if you are a neurotic like me and you strive for completeness, don't get this one.  They re-released the original film in the 1990's, a fully restored version, I'm not sure which one it is, but don't confuse that with the reMAKE from the 90's. Bad. So don't get the reddish one or the remake.  The good version has an introduction by Herk Harvey, director/lead zombie, that plays before the film. Great movie though, find the full version and snap it up.  See you in zombieland!
