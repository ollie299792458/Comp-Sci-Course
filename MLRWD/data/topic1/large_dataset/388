This DVD that came out in 2005 is so well done, entertaining

and groundbreaking that I was shocked I had never heard of it.

When I first saw it, I was so fascinated by this carefully researched and informative film that I immediately told everyone I knew about it. I assure you, it will affect you too.  Debra Koons Garcia, formerly married to Jerry Garcia, has done an incredible job of covering the subject of genetically engineered crops, seed, food and everything you might want to know about

this crucial new field. She interviews farmers, severely affected by new laws and a Consumer Reports expert that in simple terms explains the science and its global ramifications.

It also explains the political aspects of why genetically engineered crops are being forced on the U.S. and the world and the government officials, who are at the heart of this corrupt corporate mess. It's all done without beating you over the head,

in a straightforward manner, with facts that are unassailable.

I am an award winning documentary producer, so it takes alot to impress me. She should have presented it for an Academy Award nomination.  It's so important a film right along with "An Inconvenient Truth", that every American should see it.  I don't know the filmmaker or anyone connected to this film and have never written a review of a DVD before this.  For your health and the health of your family, see this, buy this, spread the word.
