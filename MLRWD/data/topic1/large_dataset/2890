Once again, Disney delivers; not only a "Classic" animated film, but loads it with extras for everyone to enjoy.  This film was a hit when I was a youngster and is one of my three favorite Disney animated movies.  [The others being- 101 Dalmations and Snow White].  All the voices fit the characters they are portraying.  Not like the animated flicks of today, with celebrities hitching to the voice wagon, just so they can tell their precocious offspring- "Look daddy (or in some cases Grandpappy) is the voice of Fester the Fish!" I especially like the voice of Shere Khan, provided by George Sanders.  Those great animators of yesteryear even made the Tiger look like Sanders.  Each frame of the film is picture postcard perfect.  I could go on and on, but suffice it to say-I loved this DVD!  Now I'm waiting with bated breath for the spring release of 101 Dalmations.  I know the Disney group will not disappoint.  [PS: Now if only I could plant a seed about releasing- The Scarecrow Of Romney Marsh].
