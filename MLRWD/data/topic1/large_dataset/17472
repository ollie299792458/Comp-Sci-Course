One of the better Disney Classics... maybe the second most entertaining after the Lion King.

This is the best plotlines that Disney has come up with (after the Lion King.

Overview:

Aladdin is a poor street rat and the hero. He falls in love with Princess Jasmine. But evil Jafar is trying to become the sultan and the most powerful person in the world. Aladdin gets the geni and must try to get the girl, and defeat Jafar.

Why it is Good

Funny

THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY!!!!! Geni is Robin Williams. Iago is Gilford Gottfried. These two are sooooooo hilarious!!!! I'm an Adult and after years since I first watched it is still hilarious. My 2 year old neice also laughed her head off. I think that it is one of the funniest disney movies. The comedy is perfect!!!

Plotline and Drama

This is an amazing plotline. It doesn't slow down. There is no part where the movie drags or you start to feel like the drama is just going on. It moves at a awesome pace where you just keep watching. The story is great. Its original. NOT DULL.

SONGS

The music is not as great as the lion king. But it doesn't take away from the story or slow it down. I mean there are no musical numbers that the story line stops and the characters start singing. The music helps drives the plots and is funny to. The better songs is the classic "A Whole New World" and "Prince Ali".

ENTERTAINING my verdict

THIS IS THE TOP ECHELON OF DISNEY MOVIE. IT TRULY IS A CLASSIC. IT IS ENTERTAINING FOR ADULTS AS WELL AS CHILDREN. ITS FUNNY. THE PLOT DOES NOT DRAG ON AND GET DULL. MUSIC DOES NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THE MOVIE. THIS IS AN AMAZING MOVIE!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!
