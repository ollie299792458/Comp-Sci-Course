Maybe the love of this film comes from the shadowy memory of Truman Capote's book which is much richer and deeper in its execution. This film can only compare as a superficial faded copy of the real thing.

I really could care less about Ms. Golightly because this character has no morally redeeming value. She is a user, an opportunist and abuser of other people's kindness. She is a party girl that has the complexity of a paper doll.

I can't believe viewers actually forgive Audrey's character at the end. She doesn't deserve the viewer's love and appreciation as she spends 95% of the movie caring for herself and using others which makes any intelligent viewer not care about her (even going to the point of praying for some bloody comeuppance). Sorry, but if you are a habitual abuser of others then you really deserve a life devoid of redemption just because you are tired of being lonely.

I lost 2 hours of my life and received no payoff; just some cheese ball sentimental closure that no movie goer in their right mind would buy. This movie lacks any appropriate resolution as if the makers believed Audrey Hepburn's attractiveness could overcome a completely weak script.

I guess this movie gives hope to all those hollow mask wearing socialite wannabes who think they can repent at the end of their miserable lives and be saved. This movie is as soul-less as the characters they present.

Do yourself a favor; skip the movie and go read the book.
