I liked this movie a lot.... I have read the book and have heard the many stories, but till recently never saw the movie. This movie is great and gives you a more in-depth insight to the world's finest (one of) crack regiment in the world. 
What makes me more than just a movie, is that fact that it is based on a true story of "bravo two zero" and shows both the heroism and courage these operators faced. Also it gives you another side and aspect of war, being a POW. 
I also saw "the one that got away" but i didn't really care for it much because it is written by another fellow and seems to be one-sided towards his views and actions. I felt in ways he disrespected his fellow mates and made himself to be glorified.
In any case I found "Bravo Two Zero" to be really enjoyable, and gave you great visuals to go along with the famous operation. It was nice to see how SAS operators play out their tasks and how they react to certain situations. 
As for realism its pretty close in many aspects because Andy McNabb, was actually a part of Bravo Two Zero in Iraq and was the lead technical contact and helped with the direction of the movie. And if you know anything about McNabb, well his is no joke! I highly recommend this movie to other special operations nuts... beats most that is in the market....
