Hudson Hawk is in my Top 5 Underground Humor Classics, along with such gems as Half-Baked (pure comedy genius), Drop-Dead Gorgeous (a vicious, yet funny, satire of Smallvile USA), Best In Show (chuckle, chuckle, snort) and Big Trouble in Little China (pure goofiness - hard to beat funny Kurt Russel).  These are all movies that share the combination of relative obscurity coupled with sheer hilarity.

To all those would-be critics who cast dispersion on those who like this movie (i.e., &#34;only an idiot would like this movie&#34;), grow up.  Just because YOU (who are clearly overimpressed with your intelligence) don't like this movie, doesn't mean others are stupid for liking it.  What I, and the majority of respondants here, have, is a particular sense of humor finely tuned to sarcastic, toungue-in-cheek satire.  Many will agree satire is the most difficult form of humor, because if it is not recognized for what it is, it will appear as crass or nonsensical (and prompt those who don't get it to label all that do &#34;idiots&#34; or worse...)

So, if you don't have an appreciation for subtle satire, stay away from this movie.  You will not understand or appreciate its humor.  But if you do have your satire antennae well-developed, you may love it as much as I do.  And the &#34;buddy film&#34; chemistry between the actors is great - you get the impression they had a lot of fun with this one...

&#60;Oh, would you like to swing on a star...&#62;
