I feel like there was never a time that I didn't know MIRACLE ON 34th STREET, so intimately is this wonderful movie connected with the Christmas season. MIRACLE is a richer and more complex film than many take it to be, and it can be enjoyed on more that one level. It is a heart-warming parable of child-like faith overcoming cynicism. It is also a satire on big business, commercialism, psychoanalysis (which was becoming popular in the 1940's), and political machines. For me, the most interesting element of the movie is the subplot involving the psychiatrist, Mr. Sawyer (Porter Hall), who has ambitions of being a psychoanalyst but is stuck in an unfulfilling job giving intelligence tests. He dabbles in Freudian studies on the side and, filled with delusions of grandeur, thinks that he is qualified to psychoanalyze Alfred, an impressionable young boy who works at Macy's. This encroachment on the innocence of children raises the ire of Kris Kringle, the Macy's Santa Claus with delusions of his own; by acting out his anger on Sawyer, he gets himself committed to a sanitarium. That Sawyer is ultimately defeated (when Mr. Macy fires him) is fitting and just, but also - like many villains in classic drama - gives him a hope of redeeming himself. Porter Hall, Gene Lockhart (as the judge), Philip Tonge, William Frawley, Jerome Cowan, Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, and young Natalie Wood all make this movie sparkle; and as for Edmund Gwenn - what can I say? - he IS Santa Claus!
