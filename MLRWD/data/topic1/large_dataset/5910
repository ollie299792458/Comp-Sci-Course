I remember seeing Altman movies in the 1970's and 1980's.  I loved every one of them.  "Three Women" was probably the most extraordinary - not to take anything away from "The Long Goodbye" or "McCabe and Mrs. Miller."  The other American auteur I remember in the limelight at the time was Paul Mazursky.  I believe Mazursky got an Oscar for "Harry &amp; Tonto."  I remember thinking back then that Altman was overdue for the kind of recognition he should have had for his work.  From my point of view, in Mazursky films, the characters were basically conventional and the exterior world was kooky - this crazy world we live in these days.  With Altman films, however, the madness was within each character, against a backdrop of a conventional exterior world.  To me this is more real, more architypal, more universal, more permanent.  
In "Three Women" the painter lady paints away on murals in a desert swimming pool showing these ancient maybe Egyptian guys who can stand alone in their soulless fortress (if they have to), while the women crawling around their feet cannot (and they aren't too happy about it). There is no road map out of this one, the weather of human existence.
All this would be depressing except that a humor which is both savage and kindly prevails, fueled by the magic of wonderful actors.  "Three Women" is extraordinarily rich in shared overtones.  As such I could watch it nearly as often as I listen to my favorite string quartet.
