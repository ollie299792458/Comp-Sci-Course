"Pumping Iron" is just what a documentary about any type of competition should be.  Much like "Spellbound" and "Mad Hot Ballroom," it pulls the viewer into the lives of the competitors.  You won't just root for the underdogs and boo the bad guys; you'll feel their pain and frustration and anxiety, as well as their determination and excitement and comradarie.

"Pumping Iron" was made in the mid '70s, long before cut abs and 22-inch biceps and were the physical ideal in American culture.  The film shows the greatest bodybuilders in the world training in basements and gyms smaller than the juice bar at the Bally's I used to go to.  Their equipment looks like they found it in a dumpster behind an inner-city jr. high.  These guys aren't spending hours and hours in the gym to get in shape for their next movie or to score a Powerbar endorsement.  They're doing it for the sheer love of the game . . . or art . . . or whatever you call bodybuilding.

If you liked "Spellbound" and "Mad Hot Ballroom," you'll enjoy "Pumping Iron," too.  Even if you're not a fan of documentaries or of bodybuilding, it's fun to watch, just for the unintentionally comedic scenes, as well as the sad moments that, at least for me, hit close to home.  You'll get a kick out of hearing a 20-something-year-old, unknown Austrian bodybuilder with big dreams (guess who) compare the feeling of a good workout to, err, "climaxing" . . . repeatedly.  Watching a very young and shy Lou Ferrigno (pre-"Incredible Hulk") take crap from his overbearing father will get to anyone who's ever had an obsessive parent pushing them in sports, music, academics, etc.

Four stars.  Would've been five, but I think it loses a star for admittedly (see the special features) steering away from documentary and inventing some conflict to crank up the drama.
