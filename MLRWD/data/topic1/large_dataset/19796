Hey everyone,

Well for those who are buying this movie for their Gooey eyed Son or Daughter Because of the Heart Throb Knowen as Robert Pattinson Please read this review. I bought this movie for my 12 year old sister who is madly in love with the Twilight star, Not knowing this movie has content in it that is not in my opinion good for anyone under the age of 16. The movie it self has a great story line and plot, Very much an art film but for those who know the story behind the movie the subject matter is about a Famous painter "Dali" Played by Pattinson, but what they don't tell you on the package is that the story is about his dealing with being Gay, I myself being gay found the film a great art piece but the Nude scene, The sex scene with pattinson Masterbating in the corner while his friend makes love to a women a little bit inappropriate for a child to watch even with an Adult in the room. after seeing this movie with my sister i took the movie back and now keep it in my collection. If you are a parent who does not care about the content then this is a great movie, but if you do care please if you buy make sure you're child or children know about the subject matter. After seeing this movie my Sister will never look at Robert Pattinson the same way again and has told me and her friends she will not even see the Third movie in the Twilight Saga, It made her that upset. For the Gay men and women out there this is a great film and someone with the eye for art will really love this film.
