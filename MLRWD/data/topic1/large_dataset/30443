I have to start off with the fact that I have not read the book.  My first exposure to Jane Eyre was the 1990's version with William Hurt.  I did not like it at all.  Even though it had a "happy ending", I felt like something was missing.  Then I watched the 1970's version with Timothy Dalton - - that is when I realized that there was so much more to the story than what was in the William Hurt version.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed this movie.  I did not find it to be overly affectionate or have any inappropriate scenes in it.  I can't comment on how it compares to the book, but I thought it did a good job of telling a complete story with little or no holes.

My one dissapointment was how they made Mr. Rochester out to be at the end of the movie.  He did not like really hurt at all - to me, he looked pretty much the same.  Toby Stephens is great to look at, so it did not bother me all that much.  I also like the ending with the family portrait - I thought that was a good way to end it.
