This is a phenomenal detailed historic event that should be viewed/taught in all schools. It is disappointing as a parent to review the history books my children bring home and usually the only mention of significant(significance defined by White-America) African-Americans is of Martin Luther King, Jr., George Washington Carver, or Booker T. Washington. These few honorable mentions are only spoken of and/or recognized during the shortest month of the year (February-Black History Month). It is the responsibility of ALL Americans to be aware of the TRUE history of this country and the morals and beliefs the country was founded. I take responsibility and provide my children with African-American history and culture. We must cease promotion of cultural ignorance. We must demand historical enlightenment in education for all races. This film is mandatory viewing in my household and should be in all homes, regardless of the color of your skin. We must never forget!!! When will we as a people wake up and realize we must DEMAND accurate historical information is provided to future generations so as not to repeat the traumatic experiences of which America was built. We are still slaves in our daily lives, with the exception of being paid, unlike our forefathers. We are still under-compensated, refused employment, refused equal pay to our White counterparts. How far have we really come???? If you don't know your past, you will not understand or know your future. People, just stop and think - What can I do to make sure our future generations are not blissfully ignorant?
