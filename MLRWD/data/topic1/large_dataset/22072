A dying franchise after some awful sequals, 3-6, Halloween H20 brings back life... and death into the series. It brings back everyone's favorite scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis as her highlighted film character of Laurie  Strode, the innocent sister of a homicidal maniac with a fetish for  mutilated teen carcasses. Unlike Freddy and Jason, Michael Myers is still a  worthy stalker, ( though I have to say Wes Craven's New Nightmare was a  superb film ). Also along with Jamie Lee's stunning performance and  revival, some new blood is drained in. Josh Hartnett is so-so, a reasonable  actor ( what the hel's with his hair!!!), Michelle Williams I like, but she  didn't have much of a character to experiment with. Jody Lynn O'Keefe (SP?)  had a shocking scene and had humorous lines, along with L.L. Cool J who was  much better than I had expected, and that Adam Hann Byrd guy, a bad actor  and ugh, he didn't fit into this film well. Oh well though.. he died.. so..  onto the next. Adam Arkin was great and his death was well played. But the  true shining parts were every moment of screen time with Jamie Lee curtis,  her 'Psycho' mother's appearance, Janet Leigh, and the return of the nurse  from the first and second. Those moments already give this film a five.  Also here's a tip, see one and two definately, 3 through 6.. well yo'll  regret it.
