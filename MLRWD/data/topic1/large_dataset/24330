Some,perhaps,all,of the points I am going to make may have been made in the other 283 reviews of this film but I feel an urgent need to unburden myself to someone other than my long-suffering wife.

  I cannot add to the remarks of others about the spectacle or the actors etc.but why were there so many departures from the ancient stories? It may well have been a basis for the old tales that a coalition of Greeks wanted to destroy a powerful Troy which was barring access to the Hellespont and Black Sea but to the original audience the point of the whole exercise was the quest of Menelaus to get his wife back so killing him off-inaccurately would have made the whole thing pointless.Neither did Agamemnon die in Troy-he was murdered by his wife and her boyfriend when he returned home;Achilles did not make it into Troy;He was slain by Paris outside the city;Paris in his turn was slain in battle by the archer Philoctetes;and Aeneas did not escape through some sort of secret passage,he escaped with his son and his aged father through the streets,losing his wife on the way.See Aeschylus,The Agamemnon,Homer,The Oddessey Book11,The Aeneid,Books 2 and 6.
