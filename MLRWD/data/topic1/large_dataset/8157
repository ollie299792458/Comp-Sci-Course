The setup is familiar to all King fans by now, indeed to every fan of the horror genre.  We start out in a nice, quaint little town, preferably fairly isolated.  Weird things start happening, people start to panic, while the main character(s) try to keep everyone's heads screwed on straight.  The cause of the weird things (usually a Very Bad Thing) is discovered, and then the hapless townspeople are left to decide what to do about it.

Since the setup itself is so familiar, the enjoyment of a horror movie (or book) is dependent on the style in which it is presented.  And style is one thing Stephen King has in spades.

The style in "Storm" comes from the characters, of whom Constable Mike Anderson (Tim Daly) and Andre Linoge (Colm Feore) are the two best examples.  They represent the polar opposites of good and evil in the story, and they both do a very good job of it.  Style is also found in the setting, or rather, the *state* of the setting, i.e. the storm itself.  The parallels between the characters' increasing mental stress meshes perfectly with the worsening of the storm's conditions, at least right up to the climax, where the two diverge.  More on that later.

The style also comes from the dead-on depictions of small-town life, complete with its choking atmosphere, lack of privacy, small-minded citizens, and petty crimes.  Those who accuse the cities of being corrupting influences would do well to spend any extended length of time in a tiny town.

Anyway, style
