I purchased this almost as an afterthought when buying other movies online.... the place I got it from, had all 3 Infernal Affairs movies bundled together. I had not heard of this movie before, and sat down to watch it knowing nothing other than a short synopsis online about it being a crime drama set it Hong Kong.

To say I was completely blown away by this movie is an understatement. I must say, that this movie, ranks up there with the best movies I have ever seen. The characters are amazing, played to perfection by the excellent cast. You grow to love and care about each of them, both the good guys and the bad guys. You begin to imagine all of them as your friends, neighbors, co-workers - this is how wrapped up you will get, in this movie!

One viewing is not enough. Trust me, you will want to watch it over and over.  I was also amazed at all the "heavyweights" starring in this movie... once in a while you run across a gem like this, where there are many major stars in the movie, and each star delivers a magnificent portrayal of his or her character. This is such a movie. I also very much enjoyed Infernal Affairs part II.  The III in the series I did not enjoy, but... I am glad that my purchase included all three DVD's.

I can't recommend this movie highly enough - and here's another idea - if you have a movie fan in your life, who is hard to buy for as they've seen it all, rented it all, get them Infernal Affairs, and you'll be the hero :)
