The first half of the movie is great--originally plotted, good acting. It has a smart beginning, good cast. But, the flashback scenes to make up the past part of the story are simply unnecessary and poorly acted, including the captor, his late wife and so on-- simply ameuterish and stupid. (But, when the scence moves back to the NOW, the room, it returns normal.) In addition, the movie is very expository--so don't mind the irrealisticity in the plot; it could be the purpose, after all. However,that kind of you-never-know-where-you-can-get-it talks are really dated. It really doesn't have to be that way. As some of other reviews have pointed it out, More actions, less blah blah blah.

  I hate to say the movie is judgmental. But it simply is--no matter how hard the director is trying to balance the blame on both characters, to make it less homophobic--or maybe he isn't. He places plain disticnt emphasis on the promiscuity of the captive's past, but only hints that of the captor's. And while presenting the captive telling one lies after another in front of the audience--though quite understandable under those circumstances-- the director seems unwilling to face the truth that the captor is a living lie himself and in no position to demand the captive to be honest. And the way he ends the movie confirms this bias. The story could have been stunningly moving, enlightening...could have been...

  I would highly recommend it to those who are fans of the two major actors--enjoy the feast of both of their good looking.
