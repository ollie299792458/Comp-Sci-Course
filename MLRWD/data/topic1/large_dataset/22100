A psychologist once said that deep grief can feel very much like going insane. That phrase kept coming to mind for me as I watched this movie. It's probably the single finest study of the effects of guilt and grief on a group of characters that I have ever seen. Unfortunately, distributors chose to market the movie to Americans as soft-core porn about strippers, with the result that a lot of people rent it and are disappointed to find that it actually requires thought and involvement to understand. In the movie, through the interaction of a group of characters with each other, we learn that they all carry the scars from events leading up to and surrounding the death of a young girl in the past. How all the characters fit together, and what the relationships are between them is a puzzle built throughout the movie, and it doesn't fall completely into place until the very last scene. The movie is a visual masterpiece and a brilliant and feeling character study. If you rent it knowing what it is and what to expect, I think you will find it a work of genius.
