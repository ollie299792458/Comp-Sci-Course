Okay, so I NEVER watched Friends until the 8th season.  The reason why is because I was pregnant (along with Rachael!!) and before I was pregnant, I worked and was a student and didn't watch much TV at all.  When I got pregnant, I didn't work anymore and watched a LOT of TV, which is when I started watching Friends.  I fell in love!  I completely related to Rachael because I was pregnant too and it was SO FUNNY to go through pregnancy with Rachael and identify with her so much!  We moved to Japan after that season (after Rachael and I had our babies!) and I couldn't watch the 9th season, so a friend taped the first half of the season for me (but I had to send the tape back), and I missed the whole last half of that season!  The 10th season, I saw most of it, but missed the last 4 episodes!  I ended up buying EVERY single season on DVD (up to the 7th, of course) and it was SO FUN to watch almost every episode for the first time and finally understand the whole Ross & Rachael history!  I have now seen Seasons 1-7 five times through!  I know, crazy, right?  I'm just a huge fan now.  So I never saw the first couple of episodes of Season 8, so I'm dying to find out about the one after Monica and Chandler say "I do."  I hope seasons 9 and 10 don't take too long, because I haven't seen 1/2 of season 9 or the last 4 episodes of season 10!!  Keep in mind, everything I did see from Season 8 to season 10, I saw BEFORE watching seasons 1-7 and understanding the Friends' history.  Oh, and on a side note, I gave birth before Rachael: I named my daughter Emily and she named hers Emma!!
