Even their saints (most of them), achieved peace and holiness w/o locking themselves away from the world.  Seems a lot easier to have rigidity and rules to follow than to have to face the real world each day and communicate.

I doubt that any type of god would want her creatures to not use the talents they were given.  Would not want them to put themselves into a prison by their own choice.  And what egocentricity, to be alone with one's self only and believe that type of existence of one man is really going to matter.  To spend the day with only your internal thoughts seems like the most selfish way of all to live.  Of course, since religions are created by men and are full of constructs they accept as truth, it stands to reason they would devise ways like this where they feel they are the ultimate in holiness and godliness.

Yes, I get it all about this film - the silent beauty, starkness, art, etc.  But c'mon.  This film was a total snooze.  I would've liked to hear a bit of voiceover explaining what type of personality chooses this type of life.  Do vocal chords atrophy with disuse?  Isn't it a reflex to make sounds aloud when, for example, in emergencies or personal dire situations?  Even laughter or anything else spontaneous seems to be natural things that would evoke sounds out of the silence.

And for those of you who leave mean comments on people's reviews, I never come back to read and/or answer them.  Spare yourself the trouble of being meanspirited just because you disagree.
