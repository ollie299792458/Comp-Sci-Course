Probably everyone remembers their first R rated movie (Smokey and the Bandit for me). This movie would be a perfect first R rated movie for an adolescent boy to sneak into. Filled with potty humor, farts, poops, spankings, and gratuitous swearing. Shows some body parts and alludes to sexual activity without actually showing it.

This movie has its clever moments. After the teddy bear magically comes to life, everyone can see him. And yet after the initial fanfare, everyone loses interest, except for the occasional person on the street who wants to take a cell phone picture with him, so the bear has to get a real job haha. The movie also had good CGI and some neat effects, like when Ted appeared as a guest on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson :-)

The storyline is very predictable. It's pure male fantasy that a beautiful and successful, career-oriented, much younger woman would fall for an unreliable, pot-smoking, car rental clerk whose interests range from sitting on the couch, to watching tv, to drinking beer, and who loves spending time with his bear-buddy more than his woman.

The movie would have been much better with a more talented, comedian as a main character, e.g., Seth Rogen has enough appeal, acting ability, and personality to pull it off and with some well placed ad libbing could have made this a very good if not great movie. Mark Wahlberg is too low-key and vanilla for this role, and definitely is not looking 35. Though to his credit, he does do a believable Boston accent which isn't easy.
