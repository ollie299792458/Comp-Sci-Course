Maybe it's the fact that I used to watch cable television nearly every waking moment in the early 80's, but this is one of those classic movies I can never get enough of!
Ernie Souchak (John Belushi) is a Chicago reporter on assignment in the Rocky Mountains whose subject is environmentalist/bald eagle protector, Nell Porter (Blair Brown).  Overweight and out of shape, he tumbles and stumbles through hikes and climbs with his agile counterpart learning about the 'other world' that exists outside the hussle and bustle of city-life.  Initially turned off by the brazen Souchak, Porter slowly finds him midly attractive but always keeping her distance.
Without giving the entire story away, they wind up crossing paths again, this time in Souchak's town of Chicago.  And in a fresh take, the movie doesn't end in typical Hollywood fashion.
Afficionados of romantic comedies will absolutely love this film.  I, for one, developed a huge adolescent crush on the naturally beautiful and charming, Blair Brown.  There are definitely some tear-jerker scenes and I'm not afraid to admit they get me everytime.  Probably the fact that for a change, you saw John Belushi portraying an everyday charming guy everyone can relate to.  Even the still photos of John and Blair together on set, smiling and throwing snowballs at each other on the closing credits is enough to make a tear well up, knowing this was one of Belushi's final movies.
Highly, highly recommended!!
