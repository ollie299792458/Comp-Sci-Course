Fargo is one of the best films of the 1990's.  It revolves around a bizzarre kidnapping scheme that unexpectedly leads to murder.  Filled with cold settings, quirky characters, and excellent performances, Fargo is an excellent film.

The central characters of the film are an overextended car salesman (William H. Macy), a pregnant police chief (Frances McDormand), and two kidnappers (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare).  William H. Macy's character is not a good person, but Macy's excellent performance is able to make us feel his pain.  Frances McDormand's character is well mannered, and strong willed, which is great to see in a female character.  She definately deserved her oscar for her performance.

Steve Buscemi is great as always.  His character is a criminal, but is somewhat likeable.  Peter Stormare's character is underrated.  His character is a psychopath who hardly ever says anything.  His actions show his aggresiveness without even needing to say anything.  I would rank his character as one of the best psychopaths, up there with Frank Booth from Blue Velvet and Tommy DeVito from Goodfellas.

The plot is pretty simple, but you still need to pay attention in order to understand it.  Part of what I really liked about this movie is how the plot is simple, but the Coen Brothers managed to create a story of kidnapping gone wrong and murder without having an overly complex plot.

The score is very affective.  It has a celtic feel to it and expresses the mood of the midwest perfectly.

The way the film is shot resembles Stanley Kubrick's style, as every shot is like a perfectly drawn picture.

I recommend Fargo at all costs.  It has a wintry feeling that stays with you hours after you've seen it.
