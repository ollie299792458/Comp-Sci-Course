First things first.....Colin Farrell is a great actor. However, he was not enough to save this movie from dying a slow and painful death. The first few minutes sets up the story as it talks about cell phone usage and how the phone booth is slowly going out of style. However, there are people who still use phone booths in the NYC. Notably, Colin Farrell's character "Stu Shepard", who uses the phone booth to call his mistress. That is where the action begins or the so-called action. I'm sorry, but a man standing in a phone booth an hour and 20 minutes in an hour and 30 minute movie is not my idea of spine-tingling action. About 40 minutes into it, I was begging the caller to shoot him. Forrest Whitaker's a great actor as well, but he nor Colin could save this movie. It was just annoying to watch. There were some good scenes, not many but there were some. The movie could have been set up a lot better than it was. It was like they jumped right into the heart of the story and sucked as much blood out as they possibly could. The last scene was really good, but the scenes before that leave you in a stupor. I wouldn't recommend this to friends. They wouldn't like me anymore. I would recommend "Identity" or "Final Destination 2" instead. Peace
