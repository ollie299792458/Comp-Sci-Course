I just finished watching this doc' by William Shatner. First impressions: what a sweet film! Seriously! It takes an affectionate look back at the series, it's impact, and how it effected the lives of the five actors who sat in the Captains chair. One recurrent theme is the toll it took on their marriages. Three of the five actors went through painful divorces, during their tenure on their respective shows. Often they were told they'd be home by 6:30, which turned in to 9:30 with a morning wake up time of 5 am. Kate Mulgrew, who was a single mom at the time, experienced resentment from her children, who to this day won't watch the show on re-runs.

You learn something (a little bit) about the actor's life working on series television. You learn what it means in terms of financial security being cast in a series with such a large following, that it's fans are willing to support you by paying for the privilege of an autograph at conventions. You see the impact a form of popular entertainment can have on the lives of its fans and how the trajectory of a life can change, for both the actor and the audience.

You get the "where are they now?" Avery Brooks is a tenured professor of theater at some University. Kate Mulgrew is artistic director of some Theatre company in New York. Patrick Stewart is still doing theater. Chris Pine is arm wrestling William Shatner on a makeshift table in front of Paramont Studios and beating him 2 of 3 times...

It's not a great film. But for a trekkie... it's the right film. Beam me up, Scotty!
