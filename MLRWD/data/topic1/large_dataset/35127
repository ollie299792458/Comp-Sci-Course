After The Wedding is filmed, realized, created, and gifted to us from Susanne Bier (In a Better World). She is a master artist. The cinematography and editing are 7 stars on a scale of 5.

Mads Mikkelsen (Casina Royale) gives us a show stopping, honest performance. He is tapped by countless international productions for his incredible skill and unique overall persona/image. He is an actor who carries his weight on screen. He is this man he portrays. His actions and movement on screen are incredible. He acts without words.

Rolf Lassgård (Swedish Wallander Movies) blew me away with his portrayal of Jørgen Lennart Hannson, a Swede tycoon in Denmark. For me, I love the Swedish actor, speaking Swedish against one of its two sister languages Danish. It is something enjoyable to me for reasons I cannot explain here. This role was far from what I have seen him portray. He nailed it.

Sidse Babett Knudsen also threw down in this work of art. Stine Fischer Christensen proved that she is a young actress worthy of her European acclaim. Stine steals our hearts and the later part of the film with a tear jerker scene.

Susanne Bier is a master artist. I understand why Hollywood called on her for "Things We Lost in the Fire", a film which has her touch, on a smaller scale. I felt that Halle Berry was the weak link as an actor. Also Fire was missing something.

I was not happy with a development later in the film. The development makes the story tick. Blame the writer.

I felt that the overall artistic beauty, lovely direction, and top grade acting make this a no brainer as a 5 star work.

After the Wedding deserved its nomination for best foreign film at the 2006 Academy Awards.
