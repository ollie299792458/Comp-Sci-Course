I really enjoyed this movie. I thought I would hate it because it was a Wes Craven film and I haven't really liked any of them in the past,But this one was different.This movie is full of "Kids, I'm sorry but we can't poo poo and pee pee." And thats something that I can really appreciate. Wes also brought back the use of an ascot on a lead character(Creepy eyes). When I saw him running around after being stabbed in the throat with a giant pen I thought "Could this really happen?" So I called my Doctor and he said "As long as you tie an ascot around your throat then it is possible." I was glad to learn this information. Anyways, rent this movie. It's entertaining. Just make sure that the copy you rent isn't scratched. Some how crybaby face magically transported from running through the airport into driving recklessly in a stolen car.How did she get past airport security without her purse? Please, it's practically scientific fact that a woman can't go anywhere without her purse.Crybaby face also sent a telepathic message to her friend (working at the hotel) to get "Kid's, I'm sorry but we can't poo poo and pee pee" out of their hotel room before the giant missile exploded their room only. I was also wondering if this was possible. So I called the army and asked, "If I were to shoot a missile into one specific hotel room only would it just blow up that room or the entire floor or maybe even building? I was glad to find out that indeed it would only blow up whatever room I was aiming for.I hope I didn't spoil the movie to much for you! Enjoy
