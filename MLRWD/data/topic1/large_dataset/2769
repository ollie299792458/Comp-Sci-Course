Anne of Green Gables (the series) are some of my all time favorite books to read and I still read them again and again and never get tired of it.

When I first saw this movie on TV many years ago, I LOVED IT so I went out and bought the videos (VHS) of the whole series. I still have the videos and still watch it at least once a year. Some of it is starting to fall apart and there's one section (about 15 minutes) where closed captioning doesn't work but most of it is closed captioned.

When I saw this coming out on DVD, I was THRILLED because I wanted to see it on DVD since my videos are starting to fall apart so I went and bought a DVD..

Got home and got all comfortable to watch then to my great disappointment, I found out it was NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED OR SUBTITLED!

I was soo heartbroken and returned the DVD. I just don't understand why this would not be closed captioned or subtitled and feel it's very unfair since this is a RARE kind of movie and that all deaf/hard of hearing people should be able to watch this movie on DVD. :(
