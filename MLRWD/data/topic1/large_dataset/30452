Die Hard will always be my favorite action film. Bruce Willis played John McClane perfectly. No other actor could have done better. Bonnie Bedelia did a great job acting as John's estranged wife Holly McClane. Alan Rickman and Reginald VelJohnson also give fantastic performances. Director John McTiernan did an awesome job with the film.
The DVD is great. The picture and sound are absolutly perfect in every way. This film is LOADED with special features. The 2 extended scenes are good. The gag reel is cool too. The film is 132 minutes long and is Rated R for: language, violence, and really brief nudity.
Die Hard is about John McClane(Willis) who traveled to LA to spend Christmas with his wife and childeren. John goes to vist his wife at work. She works at the Nakatomi Plaza on floor number 30 where theres a party for people who work on the floor, they are the only people left in the building besides the guard. A little later terrorists take over the building and take everybody on the 30th floor hostage. John is in Holly's office and isn't taken hostage. Instead he runs up a couple flights of stairs to hide. 
Now the action, thrills, and enjoyment begin. Make sure you buy this film. Its one of the best. The Five Star Collection DVD is worth your money. I bought the Gift Pack of all three which is an even better deal. I hope you like the film as much as I did. Thanks
