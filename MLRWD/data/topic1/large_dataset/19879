Yes the science is dated (the film was released several years before the theory of plate tectonics was widely accepted), and yes the love triangle plotline is a bit strained, but this 1965 sci-fi disaster/ end of the world thriller is quite exciting, suspenseful, and far superior to anything that Roland Emmerich has produced thus far. The dialogue is sharp and logical and the plot builds to a stunning climax that is quite improbable, but awesome none the less. This is a film for adults; the screenplay does not pander to a young audience. I have not seen this film in over thirty-five years and seeing it again is like seeing a long lost friend. "Crack in the World" was a staple on American television in the early 1970s, but vanished for some reason mid-decade and has seen limited screen time since. I was a bit disappointed by the lack of extras on the DVD, hence the four stars. This film is deserving of better treatment. Perhaps in the future Paramount will provide us with a adequate special addition.
