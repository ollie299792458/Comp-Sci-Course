Before I watched this movie, I did not know who Andy Kaufman was. I hadn't known that he had appeared on Saturday Night Live ( indeed, I didn't know much about SNL ) and I hadn't known *anything* about Taxi. So I walked into this movie with a wide open mind. Whatever impressions I have of Kaufman now were made by this film. And I love this movie. Absolutely adore it. It's incredible. Kaufman is difficult to understand. I don't, few have, and few will. I don't think he knew himself at all, and I think he was as surprised as everyone else by Tony Clifton and Kaufman's various other antics. The movie itself is deeply moving. Jim Carrey disappears into the role ( making some wonder if, long after faking his death, Andy Kaufman appeared in this movie as the ultimate daredevil act of defiance ). Man on the Moon is not a comedy. Kaufman's life wasn't a comedy either, and he wasn't really a comedian. He was more like a stuntman, by the looks of it. Throughout his short life Kaufman attempted a delicate balancing act, and he would have continued succeeding if he hadn't gotten cancer. That is, if he ever had cancer. To sum up Kaufman's life, I suppose there's one quote I could use, from John Lennon's song, "I'm So Tired":
"You'd say I'm putting you on/But it's no joke, it's doing me harm/you know I can't sleep/I can't stop my brain/...you know I'd give you everything I've got for a little piece of mind."
