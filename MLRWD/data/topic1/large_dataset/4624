My hat is off to Neil Simon for this incredible movie.  I grew up watching this movie and by the age of 15 I realized...nobody done it! It's seldom that a movie comes along this hillarious that makes one really think about who done it.  The premise, an eccentric millionaire (Truman Capote)with a bone to pick, invites the worlds five greatest living detectives to dinner and a murder.  Wang (Peter Sellers),Marbles (Elsa Lanchester),Pierre (James Coco), Charleston (David Niven) and Diamond (Peter Falk) are locked in Twain's (Capote) mansion, filled with mysteriously moving rooms, a blind butler (Alec Guiness) and a deaf and mute maid (Nancy Walker).  A "murder" is committed and the detectives each render a who done it.  But who really did what?

Eileen Brennan, Maggie Smith and James Cromwell also appear and together with the detectives, deliver the most hillarious lines and observations.  The plot defintely deserves a nod and I couldn't be happier with the DVD presentation.  An interview with Neil Simon sheds some insight into the casting and ideas brought out in this hysterical comedy.
