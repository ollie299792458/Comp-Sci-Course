greetings reviewers,
  did you all get a load of the editorial review of this product?
sheesh! oh well, first of all, the initial book that later inspired the movie, was unto itself, a great peice of work to begin with. anyone that has read the book all the way thru more than once will automatically know that it isnt just some drugged-
-out, loady-supreme movie! as a matter of fact it is an extremely
expert example of adapting book into film. 75% of films based on books usually end up finding a new direction in certian points of the story to help an audience comprehend the plot, or rather,
"get it" and be able to get up and rent their next movie and plop back down onto the couch, remote in hand. i suppose this movie is a desired taste and most people really will never get
to know where it directly comes from, but that should not stop you from seeing the truly entertaiing story that is being told.
or whatever, because you know, it's like when something is like
being something because that is all anyone knew until you learned it was okay to be like being something like something, or i could be right! haha. come on, jeff, have a beer at least!
