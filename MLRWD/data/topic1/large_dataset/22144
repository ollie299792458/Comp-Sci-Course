This movie was incredible.  When I first saw it, I was kind of amused by the unterrific suspense that led me to instantly figure out what was going to happen next.  But as the movie progressed, the plot became more and more vague, and it was harder to see into the future.  I even found myself tense at some points and excited to find out what would happen.  In the end, it seemed so perfect I couldn't explain it.  I was amazed.  The Professional has three things every good movie should have:

1) beautiful editing.  This movie's amazing sound editing and cuts were perfect.  You would be locked in a terrifying suspense-filled scene at one moment, and then the next it would cut into something totally different.  But it made it seem real and intense and it kept me on the edge of my seat.

2) a foreign super hero "bad guy" who fights other bad guys and does it stylishly.  The main character is perfect for this film.  He has no attachments to anyone, complete independence, a pull-your-own-weight kind of attitude, and he's foreign.  The best part is, he's a bad guy, but he fights the other bad guys.  Everybody loves a movie where the bad guy wins.  And he also possesses some kind of strange physical competence that allows him to wreak sheer havoc and kick serious ass wherever he goes.  He's so cool he kicks my butt and I'm just watching.

3) an ending that's so cool I can't even describe it.

this movie is the perfect late-night action thriller, but with a touch of gentle backstory that makes the whole thing much more worth it to watch.  i would paid upwards of $15 to see this movie in theaters.  but it's good enough on dvd.
