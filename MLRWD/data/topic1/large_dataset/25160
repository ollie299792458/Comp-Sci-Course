. . .But is an interesting movie. Sure the plot is almost laughable. But how else could we get to the best Star Trek (The Undiscovered Country). There are definitely flaws in this movie. Such as when Kirk, Spock, and  McCoy jet blasted to the top of the Enterprise, which the decks are going  in the worng order.  But its still Trek fun! The trace of bad special  effects are when the klingon ship destroyed "god" with a photon  torpedo. And how can you kill god with a photon torpedo? Shatners  personality are written all over this film. Evidence of this are the blue  painted horses which Shatner has a fond of. Can you picture Kirk on a  horse? Scary!  But the reason why I give four stars to this movie is the  terrific, most underrated score to the film. Jerry Goldsmith has created a  masterpiece to the film. I'm glad that the budget of the film wasn't cut  from the music. 
The other reason why I liked this movie is the  Enterprise Bridge. Why they changed it in VI is questionable. 
All in  out, this film is absolutely more enjoyabe than The Avengers movie. That  film was an embarassment of the film industry.
