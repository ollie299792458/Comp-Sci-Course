I waited to rent the DVD when it came out last week.  Unlike so many "sequels" that often seem like poor attempts to improve an original movie, this really is a modern gem following the original premise.  Sure, a few minor changes on Herbie's headlights, a drooping bumper for sadness, & rear spoiler (& THAT in just a few rare scenes); but his actions all show the heart of the original Love Bug.
Casting is also terrific: Matt Dillon is the perfect 'guy-you-love-to-hate'; Michael Keaton's a terrific overprotective Dad; & Lindsay Lohan a wonderful female teen counterpart to the '60s Dean Jones. Some pro-racing cameos are also perfectly placed: would NASCAR's Jeff Gordon have appeared in a "flop" film? I don't think so!
Best of all, though, HERBIE-FULLY LOADED still has Disney's terrific family charm & values (maybe even surpass "Freaky Friday," another of Lindsay Lohan's shining moments). Another Big Plus: it's FULLY-LOADED with extras often missing in Disney's older movie "transfers.
Over 1/3 of my DVD library is dedicated ONLY to Disney, & I'll proudly add this to the rest!!
