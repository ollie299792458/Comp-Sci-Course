I saw "Dare" in the local indie movie theater when it had its brief release. The screening was well attended and from chatter at the popcorn stand I knew that many people were there because it had been filmed around Philly. I was really pleasantly surprised at the quality of the cinematography and depth of the performances. I guess I expected it to be a standard smarmy high school romance. It is not. The film has some light moments but mostly and quickly drills down to real people (albeit very good looking people) in an unexpected awkward romantic triangle that flips the standard story on its head. I heard hushed talking in the audience during many surprise plot turns. There was a LOT of talk as the house lights came up among couples and between strangers as to how enjoyable the film was. Completely did not see the surprise but logical ending coming.  Also, I go into indie films with low expectations for production values especially sound. This film looked good and the sound quality and music selections were excellent. 4 stars!
