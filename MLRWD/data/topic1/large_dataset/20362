Zombie invasion.  Grim future.  Fight for survival. Etc.

Ok, now that you're caught up on the plot, let's cover what makes 'The Dead' different than all the other zombie films out there.  It's set in the wilds of Africa.  So we're talking a lot of long stretches of dirt and plains, with small villages spotting the landscape.  That said, there are zombies EVERYWHERE.  Rarely is a scene not filled with at least a few zombies lumbering around in the background.  Luckily, the zombies also walk pretty slow.  They are still a constant threat, just due to their sheer numbers.  The film has us rooting for a pair of soldiers, one white, one black, both from different armies and backgrounds on their journey to find their loved ones and survive another day.

'The Dead' strives to be a different kind of zombie film, and in that it succeeds.  There is little dialog, little violence (but when they do take down a zombie, the gore is top notch), no profanity, and survival against the elements is as much a part of the looming threat as the zombies are.  Fuel is sparse, as are working vehicles and weapons.  The acting from the leads is a little hamfisted, but gets their plight across to the viewer.  If you've ever seen a low budget, Christian film, then you know what to expect.  I've seen a lot of small, Christian films, and 'The Dead' fits right in.  No budget, rookie actors, a reverence for spirituality, etc.

'The Dead' is a unique experience for fans of the horror genre just in it's setting, and the well-crafted gore is a draw, but I found it hard to watch without constantly rolling my eyes over the obvious, predictable scenarios.
