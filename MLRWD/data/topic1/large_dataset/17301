I must preface my review of this movie. It's much better if you haven't recently watched The Silence and Hannibal. Onto the actual movie itself.
Anthony Hopkins is again excellent in the character that he is now world renowned as. Edward Norton does a nice job as the brooding FBI agent who reluctantly has to deal with Dr. Lector and Ralph Fiennes steals the show as the stricken serial killer, who we in time gain a modicum of sympathy for. However, the movie fails to match the first installment of the series for a pair of reasons.

1) The ending was extremely rushed and lacked any real suspense. It was as if two high school kids had read the first 3/4ths of the screenplay, then cooked up an ending before rushing off to a pizza date. 2) There was a lack of background concerning the films main characters, both Will Graham (Norton) and Francis Dolarhyde(Fiennes). The movie glosses over both their respective pasts with little more than one brief scene each.

So what was really good about the movie? The acting performances were superb and the movie seemed to have good flow, for the most part. In ranking the quality of the three films, Silence is number 1, this is 2 and Hannibal is 3.
