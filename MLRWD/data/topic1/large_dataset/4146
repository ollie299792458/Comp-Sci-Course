I'll admit that at first, I wasn't very impressed with Diana Krall.  Then again, I only heard one or two of her songs played on a local smooth jazz radio station.  However, after buying her "Look of Love" CD, and then borrowing a friend's copy of her "When I Look In Your Eyes" CD, I came to realize, like so many others, just how special she is.  "Live in Paris" is truly an outstanding musical video and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates the old show tune standards. What sets her apart from other vocalists is her exceptional skill on the piano.  Comparisons to Nat King Cole's style aren't too exaggerated.  The video production is outstanding with creative camera angles and occasional cut-ins of scenes around Paris (not the typical tourist shots, but rather interesting scenes that compliment the particular song).  There are 2 "MTV-like" bonus videos and both are nicely done, as well.  Definitely a worthwhile purchase, and not just for Krall fans.
