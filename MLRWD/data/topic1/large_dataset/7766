There is nothing wrong with this film!!! I LOOOVE IT!!! I remember watching it when I was 5 years old and to this day I absolutely LOVE it!! I don't know what those people are talking about with one star rating because of all the racial bullcrap ... children don't catch on to that. good grief! And the cruelty to animals and the big ears... the only thing that mattered here & that stands out in any child's mind is a) how degrading we are to those who are less fortunate, which teaches children to be more loving and understanding; and also opens their eyes to how fortunate and blessed many are, b) to keep on going and never give up & to believe in yourself... and that things do not always come out the way one intends, but nonetheless it is crucial to make something of it, and c) the relationship that Dumbo has with his beautiful mother elephant is UNBEATABLE in the eyes of any child!!! how can anyone say this is a bad and discriminating film!!!! The bigger picture is so much more!! I LOVE DUMBO (^.^); it's a great film and does not linger & linger. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!
