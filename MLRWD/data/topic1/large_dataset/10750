Tron still inspires today, despite the fact that it was written before the PC revolution.
The core of its story reveals an epic struggle between monolithic centralised corporations and networks of independent programmers for control over the future of computers.
In 1982, Tron asked - will we see a world where computer usage, application, development &amp; growth be driven solely by ubercorporations, or will we see (in Tron's words) "a free system" where the independent user can innovate, interact &amp; freely explore their digital potential with other users?
Well, it's now 2002 &amp; I'm writing this review on a personal computer to be read by anyone hooked up to the Internet, an aggregated network of PCs hooked up to hundreds of millions of users throughout the world, unfettered, as in Tron's vision.
It's true that Tron is more remembered for pioneering the use of computer graphics in film, for kicking off the video gaming age, or even for attempting to build an immersive digital world 15 years before The Matrix.
But I think that it's greatest accomplishment is that it spoke for the future, envisioning "a free system" where the computer liberates the average person in the street by providing an avenue for heightened communications &amp; abilities never before achieved in human history. Tron announced to an unsuspecting public the beginning of the digital democracy. And we've not looked back since.
It's no wonder that Bruce Boxleitner's programmer character, Allen, is named after the inventor of Apple's first PC.
