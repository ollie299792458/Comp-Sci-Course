I really wasn't expecting much from this movie, but I wound up really enjoying it. The plot's been described by plenty of reviewers-in the town of Willard, following the "Zombie Wars," citizens own zombies as domestic servants and pets. There is a large fence around the town, protecting the citizens from the "Wild Zone," where zombies run free. ZomCom, a gigantic corporation that provides everything from milk to cars also has developed a collar which, once on a zombie, renders him harmless and obedient.  If anything goes wrong with the collar, the zombie returns to his natural, wild state. There are several different themes going on in this movie-a parody of 1950s society, a satire of animal shows like "Lassie," and conventional zombie movies. It carries most of them off pretty well. The film also includes some wonderful characters. For example, one of Timmy's neighbors has a young, nubile zombie ("They got the collar on her before she hit the ground!") who is misusing his zombie shamefully. In one scene, their figures are seen through his curtains-evidently he's removed her collar and, chained to the wall, she lunges at him as he dances just out of reach. There's also a satire of the family dynamics involved. The prime figure, Timmy, has a father who's terrified of zombies, and an overbearing wife who wants to fit in with the neighbors. But there's a downside to this paradise-you're responsible for your zombie and if he gets lose and eats someone, off to the wild zone you go!
Not the greatest movie I've ever seen, but a good, solid comedy. I highly recommend it.
