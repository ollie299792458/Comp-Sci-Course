In a time when more and more film makers tackle increasingly darker subject matter, Mike Leigh's Happy-Go-Lucky takes a unique approach by presenting familiar themes through the eyes of someone who is almost perpetually happy. Poppy, magnificently portrayed by Sally Hawkins, is a very outgoing young school teacher who, after having her bike stolen, decides she is in need of driving lessons. As it turns out her driving instructor Scott, played by Eddie Marsan, happens to be the complete antithesis of his new pupil. The film centers around similar interactions Poppy has with various characters, like her roommate, sisters, students, and in particularly her weekly driving lessons with Scott. Though some may find Poppy over the top or just plain annoying at times, she embodies many characteristics too often absent in today's society. She is comfortable with herself no matter what others think and gives without over analyzing her actions. That being said, Poppy may seem like a character gliding chaotically through life. However, the more we see the more we realize that Poppy is far more in control of her life than most. Happy-Go-Lucky is a film about learning to greet life, even its darker aspects, with optimism as opposed to the all the often pessimistic views of today. This is not an easy film to make and Mike Leigh should be commended for giving the role of Poppy to Sally Hawkins, who completely owns it. Comedic performances are often overlooked, though Hawkins' performance should be met with a level of enthusiasm matching anything seen this year.
