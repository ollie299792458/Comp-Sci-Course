I don't see why the critics of this show were so adamant. After all, it's a realistic depiction of the challenges facing Episcopalian families in an overpriced suburb. Speaking from firsthand knowledge, there's very little distortion here!

Hard-core fundamentalists claim this is an unflattering depiction of a religious family and a clergyman. That doesn't mean it isn't accurate. I have traveled extensively in the red states and have encountered very godly people who are in extreme denial about the lives they are living. At least (some of) the Websters are trying to face their problems, and learn from their mistakes.

I found this series to be compelling, funny, and, at parts, very moving. Far better than most of the ridiculous stuff you see on TV. Everyone in the ensemble clicks beautifully. You laugh and cry with them. There's very little didacticism, and unlike most quality dramas, the writers don't preach out of the mouths of the various characters. (Are you listening, Nip/Tuck?)

It's a terrible shame that this show didn't go for at least one season. Seven episodes leave you hanging. Definitely worth seeing nevertheless.
