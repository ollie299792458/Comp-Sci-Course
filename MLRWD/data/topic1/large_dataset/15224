One has only to suffer through disc 9 covering 1970-1994 to be made painfully aware of all of Mr. Burns biases. This 2 hours and twenty minutes covers about 30 minutes of baseball with the rest obsessed by racial and labor issues which are presented from a predictably leftist perspective. It's the type of twisted liberal viewpoint that reeks of contempt for American culture as a cesspool of injustice. Who would want to live in the society depicted here if one was to only judge from this DVD?

  Of smaller note is the incredible East Coast bias. The perceptive fan might learn of baseball outside of NYC or Boston but he better not blink or it will be missed (about the only west coast moment is Kirk Gibson's heroics from '88).

  Finally, the various interviewees are almost uniformally non players and non baseball people for that matter, often complete nobody's whose only common thread (save George Will) is their leftist dogma. They ( espescially Gould and Goodwin) are insufferable.

  An edited version without the obsession with racial and labor issues would come down to 3 DVD's which just might be watchable.

  Laughable asides: the disc from the 40's suggest women are being unfairly kept out of the majors as players, while a comment on the 60's disc compares the labor situation in baseball to slavery. Burn's, you should be ashamed, however you're likely to proud and angry to see or acknowledge these comments as legitimate
