I was living in Lima, Peru at the time this went down in Chile.  Peru also had a military junta in control, and I experienced much of the same behaviors seen in the film (although few juntas were as bad as Pinochet's): strict curfews, censureship of the media (most of what we knew about what was happening in Chile was by word of mouth), the strong anti-American feelings that were prevalent at the time - even the ineptitude of the people who work at US embassies and consulates.

Yes, Charlie was dumb, but that's part of being young.  One shouldn't have to die for being young and dumb - especially when the American government was involved.

If you want to know what the period was like in South America (historically and culturally), and what it was like to be an American living there, this is a film you need to see.  That there were some great actors partipating in the project is icing on the cake. :) I bought this movie on DVD to share with my Spanish classes.  It definitely leaves an impression on them!
