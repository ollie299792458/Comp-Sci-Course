I agree that this is a great movie.  Also that this DVD is not a good transfer.  The resolution is mediocre.  However, the main problem is that it has no time display and won't accept "Last Memo."  Nobody has noted that.  There are (only) nine scenes which can be accessed directly.  To be sure, within each of these there are several skip points, but these are nowhere identified, relying entirely on the memory of the viewer and trial and error to return to the last point seen.  I for one rarely watch a movie continuously.  There are errands, sleep, etc..  You'd have to leave the player running on pause to save your place, and some players won't even do that for more than a few minutes.  These lacks are essentially fatal flaws, but this DVD is the only version available.  You don't expect this kind of stuff except on...Madacy discs and the like.  Some other DVDs have this same problem.  Why?  How hard can it be?  Also, on this one there are no special features, unless you call a preview special, and there is no insert pamphlet - short shrift for a "World's Greatest Movie."  I await a redo.
