Over the years and somewhere along the line, directors thought that "showing it all" to the people in a theater was the way to go....not true!  Pitch Black is one movie for the records...in horror that is. I read the book first and then saw the movie-it does stay quite close to how the book is written(much to my amazement).  Let's face facts-it is a horror movie...so yes, there is some blood, harsh language, and some graphic violence-but most of this is left up to whatever the person wishes to imagine...which for many horror films is a whole new concept! Just the thought of what one of these "lovely" critters do is enough to leave most cringing inside themselves...not to mention wanting to know what comes next-or who is next! Many of the actors are very good at their roles in the movie, and the computer graphics alone is enough reason to not only purchase-but see this movie as well.  Vin Diesel does an outstanding job at convincing you that he is one person that should never be trusted, and then by the end-not only do you end up trusting him~but also cheering him on.
