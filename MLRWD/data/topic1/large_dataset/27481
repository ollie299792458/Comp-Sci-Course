There is no shortage of accolades for this movie, and I'm just another fan; what I'd like to attempt here is to let the average viewer unfamiliar with "Vertigo" get a grasp on what the fuss is all about...Hitchcock once said to an unusually interpretive viewer, "My dear, it's just a film." Hindsight into the director's life post- "Vertigo", however, shows us something far deeper- this film proved to be as revealing about its director as its central character, Scottie.
  Scottie (a seamless James Stewart performance), a San Francisco detective recovering from a harrowing accident, is summoned by old friend Gavin Elster to follow his wife, whose erratic, "haunted" behavior is threatening her life. That's all you get here...if you have not already read up on the remaining plot points, you need no more to get the hook in you. Kim Novak plays Madeline Elster, and Hitchcock's genius--and his crew-- manage to display her in settings as memorable as a Monet. Bernard Hermann's score is a perfect marriage to these visuals as they unfold in an intricate, layered plot. The vantage point of each character, if we could imagine it, would be a completely different movie in its emotions and resolution. "Vertigo" is extremely difficult to describe objectively. If you are about to view it for the first time, treat it with respect...it demands attention without distraction or sleepiness. If you've ever cared for someone and lost them, or tried to change to be liked (we all have done one or the other) then you'll understand its message. And the critical raves, too. I hope you agree...
