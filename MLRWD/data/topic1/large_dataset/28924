This isn't just a concert video. This is a beautifully orchestrated performance that you will watch again and again. Passion is the hallmark here...Gabriel has never been content with just singing songs he's written. He throws his soul into what he does, and the superbly talented musicians he plays with can't help but to shine as well. It's a joyfull show filled with brimming sound and imagery.
All of the musicians Gabriel works with past and present are always artists in their own right. Here you will see Singer Paula Cole looking gorgeous and giving Gabriel's dusky vocals a smooth comlement. It's no wonder her career soon skyrocketed. Tony Levin, who has played with Gabriel since his Security album and also has played with King Crimson and others as well as producing his own solo work, lends his commanding stage presence and unbelievable bass playing. David Rhodes gives us his understated but vital guitarwork. Manu Katche is a joy to watch, his percussion style reminding me a bit of a cross between Stewart Copeland (who also has written and played with Gabriel) and Neil Peart. And then there is Shankar, talented Indian double violinist...with his darkly beautiful playing filled with so much emotion.
If you are already a Gabriel fan, you are in for a treat here. The imagery his music invokes is here for you, live, and on stage. If you are only familiar with Gabriel's hits, you will be introduced to a musician who is a true artist that has so much more to offer than a hit or two. Seeing this may make you an avid fan.
