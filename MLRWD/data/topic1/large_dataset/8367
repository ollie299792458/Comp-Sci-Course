I went into this movie expecting a warm, feel good walk down memory lane, looking back on a great moment in time from my childhood. Boy did I get it and more! I was in eighth grade when this took place and can remember exactly where I was sitting when Al Michaels said that now famous line! This movie brought it all back! Sitting and watching the story unfold gave me the same butterflies in my stomach even though I already knew the outcome! Kurt Russell was wonderful in this movie! But I think what I will remember most from this movie is that fact that my husband and I took our 15 year old son to this movie. We live in a time of high dollar contracts and free agency, but to watch my son look at the screen with such intensity and totally enjoy every minute of this story was priceless. All the way home we discussed the importance of teamwork and hard work. So to Disney and to everyone affiliated with this movie, I say thank you! Thank for allowing me to relive this "miracle" with my son and for allowing us to make a memory of our own! Go see this movie!
