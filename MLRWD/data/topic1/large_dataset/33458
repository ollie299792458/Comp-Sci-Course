I had high hopes for this series. I shudder to where it got everything wrong... Oh yes, Robin Hood is incapable of harming anyone. Plot synopsis of the first eight episodes:
 1.  the Sheriff does something dastardly.
 2.  Robin intervenes saves the day.
 3.  The Sheriff does something else dastardly -- someone often dies.
 4.  Robin defeats the Sherrif and threatens to kill him.
 5.  Robin is a hero.
 6.  Repeat next episode.

Maybe the series changes, but the stupid cookie cutter plot is a satire of itself. Maybe the series writers and producers did this on purpose, but I'm unsure. Robin Hood is inept since he constantly defeats the truly evil sheriff and then lets him go with empty threats.

I have been unable to watch the complete series and it could very well change. the sheriff may become competent, which would prevent Robin Hood from constantly getting the sheriff alone and threatening him. Maybe this series is a satire and I just don't get it. And I do not get the overall positive reviews other people give this stupid series.
