This is easily the best comedy of the year. It has great and memorable scenes, excellent chemistry between the performers and it is consistently funny throughout the 137 minutes. There are 17 minutes extra on this dvd and it was worth putting them in.

 The story concerns Andy a electronics store worker who is forced to admit to his friends that at 40 years old he's still a virgin. What follows is a superbly funny quest in exploring dating and sex. The relationships/chemistry between the stars is excellent and never feels forced and alot of the laughter is real, with a great deal of improvisation. If you listen to the commentary with cast and crew you feel how well they all got on with each other as there is never a dull moment when they are talking about the film.

 Many of the scenes are funny and some are superbly well written and performed. Such as the chest waxing scene, the "You know how I know your gay" scenes, the condom scene, the speed dating and the constant insult scenes with the indian worker. This is like Anchorman except that it's more consistently funny and never goes on too long. It also manages to make you care about the characters, which says alot for the acting.

 The extras on the dvd are very decent. There are deleted scenes, outakes, a number of funny segments and the great commentary that you can listen to.

 Overall you don't want to miss buying this dvd as it's well worth it for the very funny scenes and great extras.
