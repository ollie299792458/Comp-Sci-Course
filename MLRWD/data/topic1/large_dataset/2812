The average viewer rating herein should be proof enough that editorials like the one posted above and movie critics are in the minority.  Val Kilmer did an excellent and believable job in this role.  If you want a 1960's version of the Saint, watch the B/W version with Roger Moore.  I liked that, but loved this movie.

This modern day version is on target.  Elizabeth Shue (who steals my heart) is also awesome in her role.  Val's character portray's Templar younger.  Great addition!  Simon not only changes his appearance but personas as well.  This adds depth to Simon Templar's character.  He is realistic. Totally believable.  Bruce Willis did similar in The Jackal but was not called "quirky."  Obviously the critics could not get past their own personal bias.

Remember, Star Wars received thumbs down from critics when it came out.  I hope someone follows this up with a Saint II with Kilmer and Shue.  Hopefully someone will look past the blind critics and to the people who matter...us and do this.

Buy this movie, you will not be disappointed.

Val and Elizabeth, if you are reading this these years after the movie which has withstood the test of time for a decade...Excellent Job!  Thank you!  As you can see from teh ratings, we love the movie!
