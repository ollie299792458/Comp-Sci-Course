The James Bond Ultimate Collector's Set is the perfect gift for the ultimate James Bond fan. The set contains four volumes containing two disks or five movies and five special features disks, including the most recent Casino Royale movie for a total of 42 DVD disks. However, there are several deficiencies to this collection, for example, each movie comes with an insert booklet which is outside of the DVD packaging and feels like an afterthought. Many a collector will tell you that they want the insert to be included with the movie packaging for extra protection. Also, the movies are not packaged in chronological order of release. James Bond fans know when a movie was released, the packaging forces you to review each box to find the movie to be viewed. Finally, in reviewing the actual movie packaging, it feels like this project was underway before the filming or release of Casino Royale which has been packed in the box separately and looks like it was yanked off the shelf to complete the set. Otherwise, the James Bond Ultimate Collector's Set is WONDERFUL and an excellent addition to your DVD collection!
