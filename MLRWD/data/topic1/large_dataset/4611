This movie is priceless, if you've ever worked in a restaurant this movie will be hauntingly familar to you. I worked as a server for about a year and change, and this is exactly what my life was like in that time period (minus the show your johnson game). I've never laughed as hard as I did watching this movie. It captures exactly how annoying and mean customers can be, and how naive they are to think you won't mess with them back. I mean obviously you can't yell at them or anything, so of course you mess with the food! And this movie shows this perfectly (and admitedly much more drasticly than real life). But as Ryan Reynolds character says (and its true) "Don't Mess with the people who handle your food." Its just not smart. So funny.

Words honestly can't even begin to describe just how realistic and funny this flick is. I would say that, for me anyways, it now joins "Clerks" and "Office Space" in what from this day forward will be known as "The I Hate My Job" trilogy, and as the 3 best comedies ever!
