My literature class has just finished watching Braveheart, and until now, I'd never seen it. Man, was I missing out! I think this is one of Mel Gibson's best movies, next to the Lethal Weapon series and his cameo in South Park: Imagination Land. The story was compelling and emotional.  It even managed to make me tear up a little bit, especially during Merril's death scene. The battles were realistic, and the acting was well done and believable. Only Mel Gibson could pretend to be brutally tortured and make it look SO real.

William Wallace is an epitome of romantic heroism. He personifies all of the requirements to be a romantic hero; the strength he shows in battle is a youthful quality, his respect towards women (he didn't even KISS Merril until they'd gotten married) is an example of how he was pure of purpose, and his intuition and honor based on a standard other than that of society's were steadfast and unshakable as he worked toward Scottish freedom.

The film may not be accurate to a tee, but what does that matter, what with all of the inaccurate substance-lacking crap  that people go in to theatres all the time to watch? In response to Halda, I agree with you! If I wanted some serious historical accuracy, I'd go watch the History Channel. The film is raw, brutal, and Mel doesn't hold back. Watch it, enjoy it.
