This film is very close to Mary Shelley's original novel. It has a talkative, intelligent monster who learns to read and write by hiding from a family and watching them, just like in the novel. It has the monster kill Victor Frankenstein's brother William, while the servant girl Justine Moritz gets the blame. Then he kills Victor's friend Henry, and after threatening to be with him at his wedding night (after Victor's destruction of a mate for the monster before she was given life, which Victor initially promised to create for him)he kills Victor's bride Elizabeth.
Then Victor Frankenstein dies on a ship while in the process of trying to track the monster down to kill him.
The Universal, Hammer, and other Frankenstein films are entertaining, but this version seems to me to be closest to Mary Shelley's original novel. It is also entertaining and well-acted.
The monster turns to crime because of people's rejection of him because of his appearance. Unlike some film portrayals, he is not a mindless zombie, and he has no criminal or defective brain which would have made him destined to commit crimes regardless of how people reacted to him. This is also how he was portrayed in Mary Shelley's original novel.
