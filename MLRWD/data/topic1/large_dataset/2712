  As an addition to the Resident Evil universe, Extinction doesn't add up very well. It doesn t explain how the virus does the things it does, it doesn t tie up the ends we would like tied up, and for the most part its just a Milla Jovovich-fest.

  That being said, it is an entertaining action film. While not out right terrifying, it will make you jump slightly in certain moments. It does have people you want to see survive, and those you can t wait for their end to come. For a simple action film who s only real purpose was to allow another one to be made--it is enjoyable and it did leave the opening for a Resident Evil 4.

  From a technical point of view, it is an excellent transfer to UMD. There is very little ghosting in the dark scenes, the audio syncing is flawless, and the action scenes are crisp and clean. Even using the PSP-Slim s video output feature is done well. The UMD version looks dvd quality on a 32 inch HDTV.

  Do I recommend this film to a Resident Evil fan, one who s been playing the games since the beginning? No, I m sorry to say I can t. The continuity and characters fail to fit into the universe they were forced into. If you insist on seeing this as a continuation of the games, you will be extremely disappointed.

  Do I recommend this film to an action junky who wants something to watch on their psp on a long trip? Definitely. Its an easy film to just enjoy watching, as long as your willing to forget its  Resident Evil .
