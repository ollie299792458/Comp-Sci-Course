Amazon won't let me tell you what John Goodman's character really screams over YouTube to become a local hero. And it is pretty foul. I mean, what a horrible piece of writing, right? What a despicably uncreative way for the writers to scold government officials for the lack of a federal response to Katrina for so long, and then for all the bungling that came when government agencies did try to do something.

But you know what? It works. It was perfect. It was angry. It was frustrated. It was human. And it makes you, the viewer, think, "What would I do if I survived such a horrible disaster only to see things made worse by massive government corruption?"

You might think this series is all about the city and the aftermath of the disaster. But you would be wrong. It's all about the characters and how they go about their lives. They're fighting every episode to get some help, to improve their lives, to improve the lives of others or just return to where they were before all hell broke loose. And it's captivating. The characters reel you in to their special little corner of the world and make you almost wish you were right there with them trying to make that corner special again.
