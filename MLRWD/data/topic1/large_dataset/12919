The Young Frankenstein "Special Edition" DVD was made for old-school narrow-screen TV displays, not 16:9 widescreen HDTV displays.  If you have a modern widescreen HDTV the movie's picture will probably appear vertically squished (or horizontally stretched).  To watch this movie properly your HDTV equipment needs the capability of correcting the image by stretching the picture vertically.  Some HDTVs and widescreen displays do not have that feature.

The problem is in the use of the word "widescreen," because these DVDs are made two ways:  "letterbox widescreen" (for narrow-screen TVs) or "anamorphic widescreen" (for widescreen HDTVs).  This DVD's packaging simply uses the word "widescreen" in at least two places, which can be very misleading.  Many older DVDs (like this one) are labeled "widescreen" but are not anamorphic.

If the widescreen is not anamorphic it also has reduced image resolution, somewhat reducing picture quality, although the quality loss might not be very noticeable to you.  In Young Frankenstein the picture quality is intentionally grainy anyway, so picture sharpness is not a significant problem.

Despite the "widescreen" issue, for a true fan this Young Frankenstein "Special Edition" DVD is a must-have!  The special features include a wealth of priceless material, including complete edited scenes which were omitted from the finished movie.  Many of these omitted scenes had hysterical moments, including the end of Dr. Frankenstein's message in the "reading of the will" scene.  Some of the material in the Mexican interviews is very good as well, particularly the Marty Feldman interview.  Various versions of the movie's TV spots are included, and some of these spots had me laughing out loud.

If the picture format of this DVD is not a problem for you, I highly recommend it.
