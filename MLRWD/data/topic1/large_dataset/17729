The Good Thief falls flat on many levels, but the ending was strong enough that I can almost let that slide.  Nick Nolte and Tcheky Kayro both turn in strong performances, but Neil Jordan, under pressure, it seems, to justify his rendition of Bob Le Flambeur, throws in too many directorial bells and whistles.  But these only serve to distract from the more gentle and amusing eccentricities of the film (such as the performances of the Polish brothers).  Nutsa Kukhianidze is the requisite girl, and is particularly grating, like a sissified Luc Besson heroine.
Whatever problems I had with the film, the last reel at least partially succeeded in winning me back.  The climax in Monte Carlo is subdued, but there's an energy in the air.  Anyone (it probably helps if you're a degenerate gambler like myself) whose pulse quickens at the thought of donning an Italian suit and playing for high stakes in the salons of Monte Carlo. Nolte initiating Kukhianidze in this foreign world, the quiet, dignified panic always just underneath the pit crew's bored facade, flop sweat on the upper lip.  This was sufficient payout for me.
