Excellent courtroom thriller with a gritty Los Angeles setting.  The movie was based on Michael Connelly's novel of the same name.  Several plot elements were different from the book most notably two major ones but overall it was true to the book.  The film makers can be forgiven for the changes in my opinion because so any of us love Connelly's books and devour them as soon as they come out.  They had to throw in some surprises for us readers.

I'm not a Matthew McConaughey fan maybe because I've seen him in too many vapid romance comedies with Goldie Hawn's mini me Kate Hudson and other actresses.  I also love Marisa Tomei but thought she seemed too old to play Mick Haller's ex-wife.  I take it all back.  McConaughey and Tomei were perfect as were the cast of older character actors who almost stole many scenes.  In William Macy's case he DID steal the scene(s).  Country singer Trace Adkins is a delight as the bad boy leader of the local Hell's Angel group.

I was so disappointed with the mangling of Connelly's "Bloodwork" that I almost gave Lincoln Lawyer a pass.  Don't.
