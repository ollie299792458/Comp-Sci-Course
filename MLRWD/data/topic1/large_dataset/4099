This is one of the best adaptations of Roald Dahl's books, and certainly enjoyed hugely by children. This is the of Matilda, a neglected but gifted child, who goes on to tackle her mostly idiotic parents, a bully of a principal, and goes on to a happy ending. When read out aloud to children, the book grabs children's attention. The movie stays mostly true to the book, but in at least a couple of instances it adds what needn't have been added. Like the sub-plot involving the bumbling FBI cops. It may have been necessary to explain the parents' hurried escape from the country later on, but the children notice the deviation from the story. The principal, Miss Trunchbull, can get scary for the children, especially in the scenes where Matilda and Miss Honey go to her house.

In the book's illustrations (by Quentin Blake), the father is shown as a thin man. Danny DeVito is anything but thin. But he pulls the character off to perfection. The principal, Miss Trunchbull, is a shoo-in for the bully, cheating, principal. Even Bruce Bogtrotter's character is almost as you would have imagined it while reading the book.

This is a movie that the kids can watch and enjoy.
