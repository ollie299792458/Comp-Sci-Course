Ignore the Amazon review above by Tom Keogh.  This is a great film whether you are a western fan or not.  It is one of the greatest westerns ever, in the same class as 'The Searchers', 'My Darlin' Clementine', 'Shane', 'High Noon', etc.  It is also one of Wayne's best performances. (By the way, the film is 135 minutes long and Wayne's character is killed with approximately 30 or 35 minutes to go. Contrary to Keogh's and some readers' reviews, he is not in the movie "only a short time".) 
I would have rated The Cowboys with 5 stars but the DVD picture appears to be a mere transfer from the VHS edition. (I used to own the laserdisc and remember that version's picture quality as much better than the DVD.) While the sound has been remastered, the picture has not been remastered/ restored.  Frequently, through-out the movie, white marks and scratches appear on the screen.  It's a shame that Warner Brothers did not release this film on DVD with the care and respect it deserves.
The special features are good but there is no commentary, and an update on the "boys" would have been nice.
