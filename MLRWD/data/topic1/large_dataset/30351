The Blu-Ray Die Another Day would not play on my Sharp BD HP20U.  Checking the web, I suspect that I need to upgrade my firmware.
I am still trying to do this, which requires downloading a file from Sharp onto a USB drive, then going through a procedure with the player, involving a little USB slot on the back of the machine. Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to do this successfully, although I am still trying.  Amazon was kind enough to refund my money, no questions asked.  However, after checking internet sites, I note a lot of comments about the need to upgrade firmware to deal with incompatibilities with certain discs, and the fact that some people have trouble doing so.  The process on a Sharp BD-HP20U is not very easy,  I am technically probably more savvy than most, but you almost have to be Fully Qualified Geek to upgrade firmware. This is definitively something these companies need to improve.  If you do the upgrade wrongly, you can render your player into a useless non functioning pile of junk.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AQO3TW">Die Another Day (James Bond) [Blu-ray</a>]
