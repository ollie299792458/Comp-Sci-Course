About A Boy revloves around a single man named Will (Hugh Grant) and his relationship with a troubled boy named Marcus. Will lives alone, happily avoiding responsibility by living off the royalities of his "one hit wonder" father's annoying Chiristmas song, and is content to spend his days watching TV. One day he decides to lie and say he has a two-year-old son to gain the attention of women at a single parent's group; the one he snags introduces him to her friend's 12 year old son Marcus. Marcus takes a liking to Will, and retreats to his apartment everyday to escape the reality of his mother's attempted suicide. Friendships form, troubles are overcome, love is sparked, you know how it works, but the cute and mostly tasteful comedy make this one worth it.

I've always been a big fan of Toni Collette, and here she plays Marcus' depressed and suicidal mother, giving yet again a wonderful performance. Hugh Grant is somewhat predictable, but hillarious nonetheless; he knows what he's doing by now and knows what his audience wants.

I felt that the movie was trying to evolve too many relationships at the same time, and because of that the most important one (between Will and Marcus) seemed lacking a bit. The plot isn't surprisingly original, but I don't think that's what the writers were going for. I'd still recommend this one, though, if for nothing else a nice laugh.

If you like this one you'd probably enjoy Dear Frankie.
