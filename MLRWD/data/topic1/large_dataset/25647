Did I ever see this movie when I was young?  It is so hard to know with these Disney movies as I watch them with my daughter.  Some of the songs seem familiar, but is it from watching the movie?  We only got to see them every couple years or so on the Sunday night movie.

This movie, which was released the same year I was born, is much more fresh and young than I am.  First- another Disney remastering where the film is absolutely flawless, crisp, and colorful.  The soundtrack is good as well.

As for the film and story and music, this is one of the best from Disney.  Watching Baloo dance and sing the Bare Necessities is so enjoyable for adults and kids.  When Baloo puts on his "disguise" at the ruins and starts to dance with King Louie, he steals the show.

All the songs are great, but my favorite is King Louie's "I Wanna Be Like You".  If there is one flaw with the whole DVD, it is the music video for that song by a youngish rock band, and it is a bad version.  Louis Prima's original is so good, perhaps nobody could top it, but this isn't even close.  Disney has done much better with some of the extra music videos on the other DVDs.

One special touch of all these Disney movies, is compeletely unintentional, is "spotting" or hearing the voice actors in the various roles in the various movies.  In this one, of course you have Sebastian Cabot, but the one I really love is Sterling Holloway as Kaa the boa.  Holloway a decade later would go on to be Winnie the Pooh and you can always hear him as Pooh, so to hear Pooh's voice come out of the evil Kaa, is just delightful.  (Holloway also was the stork in Dumbo 25 years earlier than Jungle Book).

My daughter loves this movie and so do I.
