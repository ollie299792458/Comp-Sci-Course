Sat on tenderhooks waiting for this DVD to arrive, and essentially it is a documentary on the guitar and its many sounds and influences over the years.  Of course as a U2 fan my interest was the Edge's effects pedals and how he invents his new sounds.  Not only did he show us, but it was refreshing to see the demonstration delivered with such humility and humour.  We were also treated to a tour of Mt. Temple School and the origins of the band, as well as some insights into the meaning of some of the songs.

Jimmy Paige was great in explaining some of the difficulties encountered by bands of the 70's era in trying to put down a quality recording and the stresses of touring whilst trying to re-create this music live.  He notes that the worst reviews they ever received just happenned to be on the album with the most unduring songs -Stairway to Heaven, Whole Lotta Love etc.

Jack White takes us back to his childhood, growing up in a large family with very little money, in a neighbourhood where you were outcast if you played guitar. He also demonstrated some very unique guitar inventions of his own.  As the youngest person on this documentary he insists he is still a 9 year old kid trying to find his own direction.  But it seems his directional influence goes back to the turn of the century blues artists who lived through some very tough times (to which he could easily relate).

If you have ever wondered what drives a person into a musical direction, this will shed some light.
