I have read the novel, and seen the movie.  I was really freaked out when I saw the movie for the first time.  The scene that really freaked me out, was when the picture came to life and Pennywise the Clown was moving forward in the picture, and eventually yelled BOO, and his hand came through the photo. I thought the movie was the best thing since sliced bread, that is until I read the book.

As I saw the movie before I read the book, I was a little disappointed in the movie.  It failed to really explain the extent of the "7's" relationship to one another, and the origin and history of IT in Derry (like how it came to be there?).  I know somethings are changed, and left out when translated to the scene, but in my opinion too much was left to imagination.  I just feel certain things should have been expounded on, instead of a 3 hour movie, maybe a miniseries would have been better.

I would still recommend the film, albeit dated in sfx and look. I loved John Ritter (always loved him, since Three's Company days), and Annette O'Toole (especially now as Superman's mother), Tim Reid, and the rest of the cast. I have added IT to my DVD collection. Not one of the best Stephen King adaptations, but not one of the worst either.
