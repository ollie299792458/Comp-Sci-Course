I was introduced to this movie as a small child, since this was one of my mother's favorite movies. I have grown up watching this movie and laughing. After I bought this from Amazon and wathed it, I realized something that I have never noticed before. This movie was directed by Frank Capra, the same man who made arguably the best Christmas movie ever made, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UHOWXI">It's a Wonderful Life [Blu-ray</a>].

This movie is about the consumet bachelor, Mortimer Brewster, played by Cary Grant, who is getting married. He and his new bride decide to stop by their homes, which happen to be next door to each other, before going on a honeymoon. When Cary Grant gets to his home he finds out that his elderly aunts who raised him and take care of his crazy brother, who thinks he is Theodore Roosevelt, are murderers. They have a habit of taking in elderly men with no family and poisoning them and buring them in the cellar. There is also another brother, Jonathan, who stops by bringing a friend and a dead body of his own.

Take all these elements and through them into the pot, along with a pair of cops that visit frequently to get the mixture only Frank Capra could bring to the screen. I thas plenty of laughs and even some light hearted tension. Sixty-six years old and the movie still holds up. Not to mention this is a film the whole family can sit down and watch, without concern of covering eyes or ears.
