What do I write about first? That the story of Bobby Sands's hunger strike speaks to human nature's worst and best actions? Or that this is the finest piece of art cinema ever offered to the public? The viewer is brought into the prison, the violence, with barely a word. Only amazing visuals and sounds place us in the scenes. Interviews with director Steve McQueen and actor Michael Fassbender suggest the point of the film is not to be a political film that takes sides in the conflict in N.I., as their intent was to be sympathetic as well as critical of all sides by portraying the situation with realism. And the realism is not for the faint of heart. Beyond the visualization of the hunger strike, I think this film would appeal to anyone who is studying the art of film making because it breaks conventions of Hollywood quick edits, fast pacing, ambitious scores and dialogue-driven plots. Uncomfortably, we are given plenty of time to take in each scene. Often this is beautifully rendered with close-ups and exquisite lighting. Remarkably similar to viewing extraordinary paintings that powerfully communicate our human history.
