This film documents the progress of an idea to stop discrimination and prejudice and truly live with tolerance of all people.  It shows a rural community in Tennessee,a very unlikely location, who affected history now and in the future.  What started out as a project to see how much 6 million of anything - paper clips - could be collected to commemorate the number of Jews who were killed in the holocaust.  In the first two and a half years, just over 2 million clips had been collected, but as word of the project spread all over the world, in the next four months they had now collected over 29 million paper clips! A cattle car, from Germany was located, was purchased (with donations of private citizens)was transported and set up on ties which had been set up - all without any cost to the students of Whitwell.  The car had been renovated and 6 million paper clips, to remember the Jews and were put on one side of the car and 5 million - to remember the homosexuals, Gypsies, and others - were put on the other side. This project changed the entire town in a very touching way. The images of this film stay with the viewer long after it has ended. A film that can be seen many times without tiring of it.  It restored the values and principles upon which this country was founded. A truly outstanding film based on a truly wonderful project.  From the mouth of babes....
