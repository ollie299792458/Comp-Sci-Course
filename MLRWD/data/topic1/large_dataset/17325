I rented and watched the original Chinese version. Five minutes before I rented this movie, I heard the video store clerk telling a customer next to us that this was the worst movie he'd ever seen. This is an important fact. Because for anyone without my kind of sense of humor, - which is to say, a love of spoof, parody and utter nonsense - this movie just might be too stupid to enjoy. All of that aside, I cannot remember laughing out loud this hard in the grip of a movie in years!

Folks, this is parody at its best... taking anything even remotely serious about kung-fu movies and turning it into utter comic gold. The best way I can compare this movie would be to call it the "Airplane" or "Top Secret" of kung-fu movies. The actors are hilarious. This is more than a slapstick - it's the dialogue that really pushes it over the edge! The cgi animation is so over-the-top, it's impossible to care enough to be put off. Everything is perfectly preposterous, out of line and bizarre. And so, I have to say, it's as if they made this movie just for me.

I loved it. Every single ridiculous moment.
