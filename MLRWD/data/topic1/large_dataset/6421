I enjoyed "Frequency" very much!
There are many factors in this movie, sci-fi, crime suspense, thriller, drama and time paradox. I think the director managed to handle these various elements deliberately. I had never seen such an acrobatic, but emotional drama.
When John appeared in 1999, I was puzzled about why John was so depressed, almost an alcoholic. But in the progress of the story, I understood that when John lost his father, he lost his spirit and guts, too. I was deeply impressed by the ties that bind father and son together. As John talked to his father and got new memories, he got back his spirit.
Jim Caviezel acted the complicated character well. He didn't over-act, so this movie succeeded as an emotional drama, I think. Dennis Quaid acted the perfect father very well, too. Because of his acting, I could understand that John's life has been so sad without Frank.
I want to watch the movie again. Although I know the unexpected twist at end, I will enjoy the emotional scene in this acrobatic story better.
