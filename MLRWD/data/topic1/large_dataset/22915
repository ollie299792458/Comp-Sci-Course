Ok Martial Arts Action Fans,
This is THE ONE to pounce on!! This movie makes 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' look like a Saturday Matinee. I've had this movie on VHS format for almost a year, and let me tell you, I STILL CAN'T GET ENOUGH. Even though it's in its original Korean Dialog without any subtitles...I DON'T CARE. The Visual and Sound F/X Are Unique and Brilliant. When have you ever heard gun shot ricochets used as sound effects for someone getting slashed with a sword. This was meant for DVD. Trust me, if you have one or know a friend who does, go and watch this movie on a DIGITAL FLAT SCREEN TV or at least a 32"-52" TV.
IN SHORT, this movie is beyond fantastic; only being shadowed by 1999's 'THE STORM RIDERS' (which is THE BEST yet[Sorry Bruce, but Enter The Dragon is now just the legend that paved the way]).
Take my advice GET THIS DVD & 'THE STORM RIDERS' while you're at it. RIGHT NOW!...
Look out Ang Lee, the Korean Invasion has begun...IN A BIG WAY!!
So says,
KAN WOO
