HUGE SPOILER ALERT!!! ~ ~ ~ Do Not Read This Review If You Have Not Seen The Movie!!!

I stumbled upon this movie on cable TV having not seen it from the beginning. My first thought was this effort is clearly an EYE CANDY movie for Jessica Alba fans because she is young and pretty and apparently single, "in this movie." But on the whole, I have 10 good reasons to support the title of this review:

Check out what we are treated to in THE EYE:

[1] SCREAM: The leading lady, Jessica Alba, is named "Sydney," just like back in 1996 when we saw Neve Campbell play the role of "Sidney Prescott."

[2] CARNIVAL OF SOULS, HALLOWEEN, FUNHOUSE, TOURIST TRAP, THE FOG, THE RING, HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES and very many other classic "horror" movies ALL have a young, pretty, single girl as THE leading attraction.

[3] A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET: We have the REAL cut on the arm that comes out of a dreamlike sequence ~ AND ~ The idea of showing a pretty young girl in a nightgown in a darkened public hallway.

[4] THE EXORCIST: The quick-flash use of what some people call "Subliminal Suggestion" occurs right before Jessica Alba notices the cuts on her arm ~ just like the dream sequence sufferd by Damien Karras in THE EXORCIST.

[5] PSYCHO: Alba takes a shower and we see her naked feet step onto the floor and we also see a shower curtain in the sequence . . . at one point in the movie, Alba looked like the little girl in THE RING. There were also some camera techniques used that reminded me of THE RING.

[6] POLTERGEIST: There is the "eyeball mirror" moment with Alba which reminds me of the guy in the bathroom in that chilling sequence from the 1980's classic.

[7] THE EVIL DEAD: The trap door in the floor idea.

[8] CARNIVAL OF SOULS: Alba and that guy with the glasses are driving along and you see the moon through the far passenger window ~ a visual technique used in CARNIVAL OF SOULS.

[9] The 1975 novel AUDREY ROSE: The girl and the flames idea. ( . . . and/or Stephen King's FIRESTARTER?)

[10] SPEED: The bomb on the bus idea.

So you see, this movie was entirely DESIGNED to brainwash the viewer into thinking it is a good movie via the success of past Hollywood efforts ~ ~ ~ THERE IS NOTHING NEW HERE.

One physical body walking through another physical body has been done before, the use of a linguistic translator to heighten mystery or suspense has been used before; really, it just goes on and on and on.

In the end, I belive it might have been (or perhaps could still be?) an interesting choice to attempt this effort in the form of a story by classic British horror novelist Graham Masterton ~ though that idea merely describes my silly little fantasy version upon the matter, and that is all.

Enjoy the movie!  (But why buy the DVD? Jessica Alba did a good job of acting in a flimsy and weak screenplay.)
