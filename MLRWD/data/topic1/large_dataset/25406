Can't say I'm surprised really because neither do I!
One guy on the video ( well my version of it ( which has two versions of the film ))says that this is a film about the sex-war and yada yada ya while another reviewer says this film is " indefinable "......so hold on if even a reviewer thinks this film is indefinable than what chance do we have of knowing......effectively zilch!
We may have our own opinions on this film but the thing with this is that each is valid. If you hate this film for the basic fact that it didn't make sense.....you would be right because it effectively doesn't
So why watch it? As funny as this may seem I don't really have an answer for that question. Blind fascination perhaps, that's all!
As I was saying I have two versions of this. One that Bunuel used with the soundtrack of Wagner's Tristan Und Isolde, which you might find isn't fitting with the film ( perhaps that's the whole point ). The other soundtrack is made by Mauriccio Kagel which is far more experimental and more jarring to the person who watches the film.
I don't know which version is used on the version that is sold to Americans.....neither do I know what the other film on the American version is like. I am only reviewing Un Chien Andalou - if I ever get the chance to review the other film I'll give my thoughts on that film as always
