Terry Gilliam's imagination nearly bankrupted the studio when this film came out, but all of the money is on the screen: large-scale battles, waltzing in midair, sailing to the moon, and Death.  And all this to  dramatize the conflicts of the Enlightenment.
John Neville plays the  Baron, who alternates between swashbuckling and depression depending on how  much rationality intrudes on the proceedings.  He is a Rousseau-type  figure, despising the oversystemization of reason and being the more  creative and energetic for it. Jonathan Pryce is the villain, a John  Locke-figure who wishes to rid the world of anyone who does not fit into  his rational system.  (Alternatively, one could think of it as Nietzsche's  Value-Creating Man vrs.  Nietzsche's Last Man).  There is some dark humor  surrounding the Pryce character, as he attempts to write a contract  resolving a war in his favor.  When his opponent protests that they have  his city surrounded, Pryce protests:  "But we surrendered last  time!"  His opponent is unimpressed; the Hitlers of the world rarely  respond to rational argument.
The final scenes of the movie suggest that  Gilliam believes that a tyranny of Reason is temporary, and that Spirit  never dies.  However, it is interesting to note that the film is now  marketed as a children's picture!  This is a tremendously weak misreading,  and a recognition of the degree to which the world that Pryce's character  wants has already won.  Leo Strauss once remarked that the moderns built on  "low but solid ground."  The ground they built on has Rousseau  and Nietzsche buried underneath.
