(Note: This review was revised on Sept. 28, 2008)"Speed Racer" is a live-action version of the popular old 60's anime cartoon about a young race car driver and his family, and it's written & directed by the Wachowski Brothers, who did "The Matrix." As a fan of the old cartoon, I was thrilled with this movie, and with what the Wachowski's, the cast and the crew did with it. I think "Speed Racer" is a whole lot of fun, with dazzling, colorful visual effects, great action scenes, great humor AND nicely-done drama (a surprise, I know), a top-notch music score, and solid performances from the entire cast, including Emile Hirsch in the title role, Christina Ricci, Susan Sarandon, John Goodman, and Matthew Fox. I greatly enjoyed it's very-appealing story about Speed and his family, and how they stick together through thick and thin (in this case, the thick and thin of the car racing business). And I appreciate the creativity, the imagination, and the obvious affection for the original cartoon that has been put into this film. You really do believe that it's an anime cartoon come to glorious life. I was so very disappointed that "Speed Racer" did not do well at the box office, and also that it got hammered by most movie critics who just didn't "get it," but I'm convinced that "Speed Racer" is destined to become a cult classic, and that it will find it's audience in the years to come as more and more people discover it on DVD, and see for themselves just how good it actually is. "Speed Racer" is a thrilling roller-coaster ride, and a highly-entertaining, unique film too.
