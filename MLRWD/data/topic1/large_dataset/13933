This was a great movie that kind of came and went in a flash in theaters.

The tone is dark and apocalyptic but the story is engaging with enough fantasy elements to keep the wonder factor high.

9 revolves around an world where a ruthless dictatorship straight out of 1984 has unleashed thinking machines that have touched off a war with humanity. During which, apparently, all of mankind has been wiped out. However one scientist was able to create a set of dolls and infuse them with his spirit and they are all that is left of us as a species.

The machines still hunt through the ruins looking for enemies to destroy and these living dolls are on the menu. But when doll #9 finally awakens, it may be time for the status quo to change.

I really enjoyed this film and recommend it highly. I would say the film is suitable for teens and older. There's nothing of a graphic nature but the themes and tone is a bit dark for younger tastes. All in all an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.
