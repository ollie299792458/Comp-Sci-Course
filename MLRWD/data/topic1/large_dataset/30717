Most of us who come from a small town know the importance of that Someone who opens a bar for the homosexual men and women to gather. This flik reminded me of the times we had in central Calif. There was such a bar in Bakersfield , Ca. Merle Haggard , red neck oil fields country. The place was called "Lena's" and she was our mother away from home. Without that pressure relief I don't think I would have made it. So, this is an tribute to Lena who is long gone. This was in the mid  to late 50'S and she had a small beer and wine place that had about 10 stools at the bar. It was located on an triangle outside of city limits , an old one time two pump gas station. It was 45 miles from Porterville, to Bksfld. And the highway was well used to get to Lenas' on a Sat. night. Even after last call we closed Lenas and she would let us gather at her place and continue the party. We all would drag ouselves home just in time to change and go to work at the State Hospital in Pville. I would do necessary work and then go lay down in the rag room to take a much needed nap. The place was so big that no one caught me, but would ask where have you been 'Oh cleaning out a room'. I salute you Lena , for having a place for us to gather in the bleak 1950's  In a valley of REDNECKs . In 1959 I moved to San Francisco. Finally made the big time. Stopped in Bakersfield to look up Lena in the early 70's and she had moved into town. Still had a bar. She died in late 70s. Hears to all those great small-town hangouts for the homosexual , may they still flourish. **** yaaah69
