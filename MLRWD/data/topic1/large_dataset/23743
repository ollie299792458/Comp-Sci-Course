For what it is, this movie is great. Very not typical of a Robin Williams film, but that's just my opinion.  I have seen Robin do so much, from comedy, to this. I was very impressed with his acting. He made the movie and played the character perfectly.

Plot

This movie is basically about a photo obsessed freak who is lonely and shares his time constrcuting a collage of a frequent customer's family at the photo place he works at.  After he is found out, the movie really starts to get interesting. "Cy" (Robin williams) does a variety of things to give off that "freaky, stalker vibe", and in the end, I really appreciate the orginiality of this movie, and I truly think it was an underdated release.

Pro's:

Of course Robin Williams acting in the film, Original plot/story line....

Cons:

Wasn't the best quality, sort of low budget.

Overall

I was very pleased with this release. It's probably cheap enough now that to buy it would be worth it for any true Robin Williams fan, indeed.
