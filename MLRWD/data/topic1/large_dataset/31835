This video is all hype and delivers nothing.  I love dancing.  Dancing in this video is horrible.  For the latin section, there was hardly anything LATIN about it!  It was like she took some aerobics moves and added latin words to them.  Ick!  Not too mention it's hip hop music in the background with a small segment of horns added.  I love Latin dancing and didn't enjoy this at all.  The other dancing sections were equally cheesy.  They were soo cheesy I just felt like an idiot doing them.  If you are not at a stage in life where you still go to clubs/go out, i.e. 40+) then you MIGHT enjoy this.  If you do currently go out dancing it's just going to be torture.

As for the workout, very low-intensity and lots of lulls as another reviewer said.  Definitely not for anyone who enjoys real dancing (because this is horrible) or an advanced exerciser because the workout does not keep your heart rate up.  I wouldn't even recommend this for a beginner because the choreography and direction are way too clumsy.  I think that would make a novice exerciser feel awkward when really it is the video and instructor that are the problem!  Don't waste your money....  there are lots of better vids out there.  This is awful.
