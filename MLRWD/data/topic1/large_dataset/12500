I can honestly and proudly say I have watched this season of Survivor over ten times.  It is truly the best season of Survivor.  For someone who has never watched Survivor or who has never been into reality t.v. this is a FANTASTIC introduction.  This show captivated America's hearts more than any other season.  The cast was so diverse, we have Elisabeth Filarski (now Hasslebeck from The View) who is one of the ultimate Survivor heroes and truly and inspiration.  Right next to her we have Colby Donaldson, one of the most iconic players of all time.  We have the loveable Kentucky Joe-Rodger Bingham, Tina Wesson is one of the most underrated players in all of Survivor, Jerri Manthey the ultimate female Villain the show has ever seen.  The cast was just spectacular, there was so much raw human emotion throughout this season.  There is the biggest injury in the history of the show, a flood, ultimate starvation, and more!  I can't explain how connected I felt to these people after watching them on TV.  They were just incredible.

If you are on the fence about buying this, buy it.  You will not regret it.  This DVDs is the best of the Survivor seasons as far as bonus features, 6 commentaries, lots of featurettes, and the Back From the Outback episode.  I really urge you to make the purchase. TRUST ME. You will be so glad you did.  i bought this for around $40.00 the day it came out, and to be honest, if my copy ever breaks, I WILL buy it again.  I own all the Survivor DVDs but this season in particular has a special place in my heart and will always be my favorite.
