I'd heard about this movie through word of mouth (Amanda Palmer recommended it highly, and I love her taste so there you go), and it was everything I thought it would be -- emotionally draining, beautifully filmed, and powerful on so many levels. Mark Rylance and Kerry Fox give us stellar turns as the once-a-week lovers who meet in a grotty flat for sex that somehow manages to be passionate and detached at the same time, and when Rylance starts wanting to know more about Fox (almost against his will), the movie becomes something amazing. Timothy Spall is absolutely marvelous as Fox's cuckolded husband, and the scene where he and Rylance play billiards and talk about cheating spouses cannot be missed.

Yes, there's nudity, and a fair amount of simulated sex, and kudos has to be given to Rylance for playing what must have been a physiologically challenging role. But the contrast of these two people, who are so physically open with each other and yet so emotionally cut off, is a beautiful essay on the problems of intimacy. Excellent work all around.
