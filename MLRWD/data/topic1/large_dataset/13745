When this movie was released in the theater's there wasn't much of a buzz, but it was only a matter of time before the first rock musical became a huge success.

The movie, based on the stage play Tee Rocky Horror Show, it is filled with memorable songs and lines, and great early performances from Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick (the mayor on Spin City), Meat Loaf and Tim Curry.

This edition comes with both the UK and the US versions of the movie, but the only difference is the UK version has an extra song, which isn't that great and it is at the end of the movie when you are ready for it to be wrapping up.

This DVD has to have the best special features I have ever seen.  It has a feature where it notifies you whenever there is an "action" you are supposed to perform when at a theater.  Another feature actually allows you to see clips of people performing at theaters whenever they come to the scene of the movie.

You will not be disappointed with this purchase.
