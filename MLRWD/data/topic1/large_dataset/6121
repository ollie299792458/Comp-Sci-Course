The story is a familiar one , yet told in such an UNconventional manner .Perhaps some 15 to 20 minutes too long , but overall ,being - moved so emotionaly more than once and especially during the ending images made me forget what might be a topic for discussion .How well... FEELINGS are conveyed to the spectator just through IMAGES ,the use of color,close ups and ocasional MUSIC which I have here made a brief compilation for FANS of this film .
