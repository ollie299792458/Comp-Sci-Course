I look at and read other reviews of 5 stars that were posted in 2001 when the film was released and I'm just dumbstruck. Where did the time go so fast? I really dont get it.

I'm almost 21 in a month and two weeks and these films were my childhood- other young adults my age who've seen these know what I'm talking about. These films for us were a complete and utter craving. We all wanted to be spys and be a part of the OSS and have cool gadgets and have Mom and Dad sit us down and confess that they're not really a doctor and a Salesmen like they appear to be but undercover OSS Secret Agents.

I remember when each trailer was released, kids in my neighborhood would all get together and play Spies and make the streets of our neighborhood the OSS. It was our youth.

These films sure as heck aren't going to earn a Golden Globe but they will remain in my chapter of childhood in the book in my heart. These films were pure, clean, real and left our imaginations running wild for months long after we walked out of the thearter. Bravo! cast & crew, you really struck gold for kids my age back then. And I sure thank you for it.
