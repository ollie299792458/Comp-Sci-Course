Alfred Hitchcock just came to Amerca just a few years before he made Saboteur.  His first film in America was the splendid Rebecca in 1940, but still clinging to his British roots, he used a practically all-British cast.  Saboteur came a little while later, and by this time, he was comfortable with Americans.  Robert Cummings was not his first choice for his leading man here, and there is still those who did not agree with Cummings as his choice.  The strength of this movie lies in the tremendous supporting cast of wonderful and strange character actors led by Otto Kruger, Norman Lloyd as Fry, and many others.  Here Hitchcock used these actors as additions of strength to this movie easily making their parts and gimmickry more inportant that Cumming's hero.
Here also is the use of famous places to identify the movie to the audience, to give the viewer the "I've been there!" feeling.  In wartime, the Statue of Liberty was an ideal place as a finale to the movie and as a key symbol during wartime.  Hitchcock used all of the gimmicks he knew and learned during his English period in America to product a film that only Hitchcock could have made.  The suspense and the supporting characters is the strength here.  If you like "North By Northwest", "Saboteur" is its direct predecessor.
