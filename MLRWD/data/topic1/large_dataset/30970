This is one of a handful of films that seems to improve with age (Dr. Strangelove is a film in a similar vein that fits this category). I liked the movie when I saw it in 1985, seeing it again in 2002 it is even better. Perhaps it is because the question of Freedom vs Security has become so much more relevant to us today. Along with this we can also look back and see what a big influence Brazil has been on filmmaking from a purely technical standpoint. 
So many careful details now stand out: script, design, score, casting. The casting is marvelous. Johnathan Pryce is superb and it is a delight to see actors such as Katherine Helmond, Jim Broadbent, Bob Hoskins, Michael Palin at their quirky best.
The Criterion edition is worth the extra money for the fascinating story of the battle over Brazil. Some of what is put on the CD, information about the making of the film, is disappointing as it is only text and could have been simply put in an accompanying booklet. I have not yet had the heart to look at the studio cut, the so-called "Love Conquers All" version, but am glad to have it. This is the version you are likely to see on televion that is typically given about a 2-star rating.
