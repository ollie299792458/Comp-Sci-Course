A group of campers play a deservedly mean prank on an abusive counselor that accidentally results in his tragic burning. Years later, the disfigured, demented man known as Cropsy heads back to camp to take revenge.

Cleverly based on the old campfire terror tales of tradition, "The Burning" may sound like a flat-out rip-off of "Friday the 13th". Well, the filmmakers claim they had this story BEFORE "Friday the 13th", and maybe they did, because it somehow feels like a better movie than the usual Jason fare. The campers seem more real and sometimes even likeable (though I can't help but hate them a little for having so much fun; is summer camp really like it is in the movies?), and Tom Savini's makeup/effects work doesn't hurt the film either. It is a bit hard to tell the campers from the counselors at times, even though some folks looked too old to be at summer camp, and seeing Jason "George Costanza" Alexander as the life of the party with a full head of hair is just plain weird, ha, but overall it's a great piece of classic slasher fun that you definitely should see if you're into '80's horror.

The DVD features a widescreen presentation and includes the theatrical trailer, a gallery of stills, and a great interview with Tom Savini as he gives us the behind the scenes scoop on "The Burning". There's even a fine audio commentary with Director Tony Maylam and International Film Journalist Alan Jones. So go out and pick this one up. Oh yeah, and remind me to chew my parents out for never sending me to the non-stop orgy that is summer camp! Don't get me wrong though, it's mild here compared to in the Jason films.
