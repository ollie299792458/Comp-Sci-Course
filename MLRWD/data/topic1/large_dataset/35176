This is absolutely one of my favorite movies due to the fact that you can clearly see the struggle of mankind -- the struggle between flesh and spirit.
The main character, played by Robert Duvall, is a man that loves God with all his heart, wants to be used of God and minister to people yet hasn't won the battle that rages in him and that is the battle for control of his life -- spirit vs. flesh.  
What I liked was that even though he made mistakes, even though he made wrong decisions, God forgave him and mightily used him to further the Kingdom of God.  You could see how God can take a situation that seems hopeless and turn it around to be mightily used by Him to turn the eyes of all to the only One who matters -- God Himself!!
This is one to watch again and again to remind yourself that we are human and do make mistakes, but that there is always forgiveness for a repentant heart and a time to move on in the things of God.  Despite mistakes, God can always use a repentant, yielded-to-God heart --- and you will clearly see that in this movie!
