The Muppet Show is something which, in all likelihood, could never happen again; the days of the television variety show and the British music hall are gone for good. Certainly post-Henson Muppet fare has been, to be blunt, lackluster. Despite that, the Muppet Show remains evergreen for future audiences, giving not only a time capsule to the 1970s, not only a bit of insight to stars great and small who crossed the Muppet stage, but a thick slice of wholesome family entertainment. What's more, the Muppet Show's provided family entertainment that did not lower itself to kiddie pablum, but rather appealed to broad, simple and universal emotions: the desire to be loved, the desire to find happiness, and the absurdity of the world.

Thus, how could I help but love Season 2 of the Muppet Show?

There are only two flaws for me. If there's a sound flaw (as other reviewers have repeatedly stated) I can't detect it- or at least I don't care enough to detect it. I definitely miss the Muppet Morsels from Season One, though (but not enough to endure the not-quite-uncut nature of Season One's episodes). The Morsels added greatly to the DVD. Second, The Muppet Valentine Show is, and I'm sad to say this about anything Jim Henson himself worked on, it was really horrible. The original Koozbane sketch and "Frog Went a'Courtin'" were all that was worth salvaging from that sickly-sweet disaster.

There is one other distinct improvement over Season One's release- aside, that is, from Season One containing expurgated versions of several episodes. That improvement is the addition of chapter break points within each episode, so that the viewer is not obliged to hold thumb to a scan button to rewind or fast-forward through half the episode to watch a really good bit.

Buena Vista is, apparently, learning from past mistakes; let's hope the learning continues.
