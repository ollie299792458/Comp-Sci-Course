Perhaps it's because I know Hollywood, Florida so well.  Perhaps it's because I'm a big fan of William H. Macy and love Cheryl Hines or maybe it's because Brian Hecker  writes a great screenplay or because Steven Kaplan was perfectly cast to play Danny (Brian's alter ego), but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!

It's more than a coming of age movie about finding a date for a prom.  The movie shows the angst of a high school senior who is not part of the "in" crowd who feels there is something he has to prove by going to the prom with the "right" girl, especially since even Bart, the nerdiest kid in school has a date and a "room" booked for the "after prom".

William H. Macy, as the dad, is funny in every scene as the self absorbed, nerdy, divorced guy who can't get a date hmself yet throws himself into the act of finding a date for his son at the 11th hour even if it means renting a girl who, in fact, charges by the hour.  The ending is a bit of a surprise and a delight.
