This  1980  film  is  certainly  no  Oscar  caliber  film  but  comedies  almost  never  are  anyway  but  no  other  comedy  will  provide  as  many  laughs  as  this  one.  The  film  features  an  All -  Star  cast  including  Chevy  Chase  ,  The  saddly  departured  Ted  Knight  and  Rodney  Dangerfield  ,  Bill  Murray  ,  Michael  O'Keefe  and  Cindy  Morgan.  Director  Harold  Ramis  guides  this  film  with  'ANIMAL  HOUSE '  Hijinks  at  a  POSH  COUNTRY  CLUB.  The  standouts  are  all  around  but  Dangerfield  and  Murray  steal  the  show.  Dangerfield  is  a  rich  businessman  who  taunts  Knight  with  threatening  to  buy  the  club .  Dangerfield  comes  up  with  one  liner  after  another  and  most  every  one  will  make  you  laugh.  Murray  star's  as  the  looney  groundskeeper  who  is  at  war  with  a  Gopher  that  is  ruining  the  golf  course.  Murray's  comic  performance  is  one  that  will  always  be  remembered.  Chase  does  a  decent  (NOT  GREAT )  job  in  his  role.  Michael  O'Keefe  is  right  on  target  as  a  Teenager  who  is  struggling  to  decide  what  to  do  with  himself  after  graduating  High  School.  And  Cindy  Morgan  is  absolutely  HOT  as  Knight's  Neice  who  has  every  Guy's  eyes  all  over  HER  from  START  to  FINISH.
