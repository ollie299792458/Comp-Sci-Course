It staggers me now that when I first saw this movie in the cinema upon initial release back in 1985 I was actually disappointed!  I was 15 then and guess I expected gore and deaths every 5 minutes in place of say a plot, acting, character development, etc...  Since then I have seen the film over 20 times, purchased the poster, soundtrack and the film both on VHS and DVD (not many extras on the DVD version, unfortunately)  This film has great acting by all leads, but Stephen Geoffreys as "Evil Ed" steals the show - my favourite quote is when William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse are resigned to defeat by vampires and "Evil Ed" remarks "Then we'd have vampires taking over the whole town (looks out window) - not that it'd be much of a loss..."  Great score by Brad Fiedel ("The Terminator") and attention to detail - smash cut camerawork and great flying effects.  This is an ideal horror movie to show anyone uninitiated in the genre - couple it with "The Lost Boys".  The sequel is also worth watching (once).
