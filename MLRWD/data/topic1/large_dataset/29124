The concept of Jason in outer space and on a space ship turned out to be
a novel idea for a movie. Jason has been capturedn and secured. He is being held for the good of science. He manages to escape and kills everyone in the building. He and a female scientist are frozen in a room.
They are discovered 450 years later. They are then put on a space ship. The scientists on the ship decide to bring the female scientist back to life. They are sucessful. In the meantime Jason thaws out and comes back to life. He goes on a shipwide killing spree. Nothing can stop Jason. He
is finally taken to task by a female cyborg robot. She thinks that he has
been killed. One of the machines malfunctions and regenerates Jason and
makes hime that much srtonger. He is now indestructible. In the meantime
the crewmembers are trying to escape. Jason attempts to kill them until they escape. Jason is cast off into space. His remains land in Crystal
Lake. This was definitely a new version of Jason that may seem a bit farfetched but it still made a good movie.
