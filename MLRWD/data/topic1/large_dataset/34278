I am not a John Wayne fan, nor do I particularly like westerns, but this one is one for the ages. I would not recommend it for watching with any children under, say, at least 12 or 13, and I would certainly recommend watching it WITH them (actually in the same room).

The characters are typical for this type of film-- John Wayne is a gruff, reluctant cattle driver who has to settle for hiring a bunch of young men and boys to get the cattle where they need to go. The cook is a well spoken, but hardly namby-pamby, educated black man. The boys are just that, trying to become men as soon as they can. Playing these roles are the likes of Robert Carradine and A Martinez.

This is definitely a movie from the 70s. The boys are on a cattle drive, for cripe's sakes! They're going to swear and compete against each other in all kinds of ways. They visit a whorehouse. Don't watch this movie if you have a lofty ideal of what boys would do if they were alone with just the guys. The point of the movie is that they all gain something from being on the drive with Wil Andersen (Wayne) as their boss. And when they come home, they're men. Bruce Dern's character is the one that forces this change, but Wayne's character is the one they emulate. And no, he isn't "politically correct" (Did I mention that this is a western from the 70s?) or particularly fatherly. He's a man-- a man with scruples who literally turns his back on those who have none.

This is a movie that almost everyone can enjoy if they don't ask for anything more than what it is: an excellent coming-of-age western made in the 1970s. This is about honor and setting things right. To quote an old Kenny Rogers's tune, "Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man."
