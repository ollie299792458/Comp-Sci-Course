I've bought this movie 3 times: VHS, DVD, and now Blu-ray. I can't believe the complaining about "bad transfers". I got this one when the price was only $11.99, in spite of negative comments. I waited too long! I can understand that people get nervous when upgrading favorites to Blu-ray. But some of the comments are silly. "The transfer is too dark" was one of them ("...whoever is responsible should be fired!" they said). This movie has ALWAYS been dark during the first part of the film: nights during winter in Detroit, with interiors in a bar, a movie theatre, and a brothel. Now, with Blu-ray, I can FINALLY see the details in the backgrounds during the first part of the film! The second part is in daytime Los Angeles, with its sunny smog, and here the colors (and detail) are also MUCH improved; AND the soundtrack! On the same disc are generous bonus commentaries and scenes as well.

If you like this movie, it's just crazy not to add this Blu-ray to your collection at its current LOWEST price!
