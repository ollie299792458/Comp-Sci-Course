I have spent some time reading the other reviews for Red Tails, and I must admit that I am surprised at those that gave it a less than 3 star rating. I guess you just can't please some people. I say this because Red Tails has just so much going for it. Based on the famed Tuskegee Airmen, it is an exciting depiction of war in the air, with a great cast, top notch screenplay, and absolutely outstanding computer graphics, courtesy of George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic team, who are simply the best in the business. It all seemed so bloody realistic! As for the cast, well, they were great. Led by Terence Howard & Cuba Gooding Jnr, they faithfully portrayed a group of young negro pilots, sidelined by the US military because of their colour, & the false premise that they lacked the courage & intelligence to fly against the best pilots that Germany could produce. But when they are given the opportunity to act as cover for the long-range bomber groups, they finally get the chance to prove their worth, and they do it in style. The battle scenes are superb & among some of the best computer graphic action you will ever see. I loved Red Tails, & if great war action is your bag, then watch this film; you will not be disappointed.
