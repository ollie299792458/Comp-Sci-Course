"It's Complicated" is a movie starring Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin ,and Steve Martin focuses on the lives of a wealthy divorced couple and the complicated relationship that ensues when they have an affair after being apart for 10 years.

Meryl Streep plays Jane and is fantastic as a talented cook and owner of a pastry shop.  Jane decides to build an addition to her house while dealing with the idea that, because her kids have moved out, she is alone.  She ends up getting sauced with her ex while they are in New York for their son's graduation and one thing leads to another.  In  the meantime, Jane's architect, Adam, seems quite nice and relatable.  Adam and Jane go on one of the funniest dates I have seen in a while.  The big question is "What is going to happen in this strange love triangle?"

All of these characters are flawed but extremely likable, even the slightly neurotic wife of Jane's ex got some sympathy from me.  I like that all of the characters are middle aged, not too crazy, and could be real people.  The plot doesn't involve a seriously far-fetched cougar story line or insane and wacky antics.  My only issue with this film, however, is that it did tend to drag about around the middle.  If you can get through it without being too bored, I think you'll like the movie.  (PS: It helps if you're a woman, too.  My husband was more focused on his laptop than watching the movie.)
