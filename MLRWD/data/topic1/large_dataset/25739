A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of the best movies from the 80's so Nightmare 2:Freddy's Revenge tends to be bashed for being too slow or for being too much of a departure from the original.I personnaly believe this movie is in-between.Certainly nowhere near the original but there are many worse movies.So,anyway,the best horror icon from the 80's,Freddy,is back and he wants to possess a boy's body to keep going with the killing.Here's a huge change compared to the original.I admit it's weird to see a Nightmare where nightmares aren't the main attraction but there are still a few to see.In this sequel,Freddy is just like he is in the original.So he does not have a whole lot of dialogue and he's still very much in the dark.If you expect a movie as scary as the original,though.....The cast is decent but I find myself preferring the original's cast.Of course,one of the movie's weirdest parts,it's all the homoerotic content.It's kinda intriguing because you get to wonder what Jesse's sexual preferences are but it's never taken very far.The first half of the movie is mostly watchable but it does not pick up until the second half which is disappointing.The original was great from beginning to end.This one has so many slow spots that you might lose interest before the fun begins.The climax of the movie isn't quite as bad as people claim.I like it but the original was more satisfying overall.Well,this movie deserves 3 stars in my opinion.Good movie but it pales compared to its prequel and that's what I hate.
