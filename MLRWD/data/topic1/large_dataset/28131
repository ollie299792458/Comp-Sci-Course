I rented this movie from the library because the jacket said it was about World War II. Roberto Begnini is hilarious in this movie. His slapstick humor is divine. He tries so hard to win his "princes" over, Dora. He poses as the minister of Rome at her school in order to talk to her. He has the children in laughter doing his spiel on the Italian Race and why it's superior. He eventually wins her over and they have a son together, Joshua,
On Joshua's birthday, they are taken to a concentration camp. Dora looking for her family, finds them at a railroad crossing and demands to get on board, After much pestering, they let her on board and this is how she gets to the concentration camp. Begnini develops a game for he and Joshua to compete in. He says they are to win a tank if they win against all the others in the concentration camp. He manages to keep Joshua alive despite all the children in the camp being killed. This is a lovely heartbreaking story of love and courage. I don't want to give up the ending because its so beautiful. This movie deserves five stars. It's in Italian with subtitles, but after a couple minutes of reading, You don't even realize you are reading anymore. I recommend the dubbed version.
