One of the biggest of the Warner's bio-epics ended up also being the most troubled and misguided (hence the confusion over it's running time...it was heavily trimmed after initial showings...which may explain some of it's coherence issues...and the footage appears to be lost and gone forever...like the bits of "The Public Enemy" that were excised for it's reissue after the production code started snipping the fun and grit out of film)...

  A stunning cast (not all well used) and the glow of the studio system at it's height make it a glorious failure (even the semi-turkeys were pretty amazing in 1939!!).  Most notable aspect is probably Bette Davis taking a break from her tiffany starring vehicles to handle a rare supporting assignment...but one that grabbed most of the notices by giving her a showy descent into madness.

  Paul Muni all but strains himself to transform into  the indigenous bred Mexican revolutionary hero...but Brian Aherne copped the films only major oscar nomination for his graceful turn as the misguided European title bearer who paid the ultimate price for being a pawn of French Empire aspirations gone wrong.
