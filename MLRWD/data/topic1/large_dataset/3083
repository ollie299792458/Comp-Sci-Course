It's one of the greats movie that I saw in my life and I consider it in the history of the films, It's doesnt have comparation to Tarantino film, think in it is the same to try to compare Picasso and Van go, may be the begin of the film is alike to tarantino dog but is completely different try to compare the movie, it's simply try to depress the art of each artist, its not a good comment.
This movie is more deeply, reflects the life of citizens in many countries the search of love accomplish with the suffering, the life of the people in each social status and their priorities in their lifes, the chritics saw in Amores Perros this conjugation of elements if you live in one rich country may be the perception of this collide feellings its not clear for you (What is hunger if I never feel it in my own body?), but it can be the reallity of life of one human being in one place of the world not only Mexico, this point of view is very far for any Tarantino movie.
Amore perros shows the art of the reallity sometimes hard and cruel in the search of better way of life for some people only with their own experiences and their whishes like the only elements that guide them trhough the life. The car crash links the lifes of different social status people, it break and transform their current life in one way that they never though and show their priorities of one of them like vanities compared with the opposite life of the other people. The love of the assesin to save the life of the dog returned in dead of all other dogs when the dog love to the assesin (the dog love the assesin but it kills all the other being - dogs - that love him).
The crithics saw in Amores Perros more than this short comment that I am writting the most important art cause controversy in many points of view, but cause immediate appreciation when you see it, if it wins Cannes is because it is a good movie that transform your feeling from the begin to the end of the movie, if you want to see the movie dont expect to see a Hollywood movie or any nice movie if you want to see that, see Harry Potter. In Amores Perros expect to see art, captured reallity of the cruel world for many people and the search of the happiness in each individual concept of it, sometimes may be never reached !!!.
5 stars but this movie must have 6
