This is my second favorite Disney movie (Aladdin is my first).  What I like about this movie has mostly to do with the slapstick comedy.  Not too many Disney animated movies have this much slapstick in it.  Even my (soon-to-be) two year old son laughs at it.  He loves when they show Yzma explaining why she "has gotten into this bad habit of running the country behind my back" (Kuzco's words), and they show a close-up of something that was stuck between her teeth!
Yzma has to be my favorite Disney villain.  Sure, she's "living proof that dinsaurs once roamed the earth", but it's due to the fact that she has to be the most humorous of all the villains, other than Jafar from Aladdin.  Also, I think that Kronk is hilarious as her right-hand man.
I also like the character Pacha.  He didn't want to help the emporer in the first place (the emporer did want to destroy his village and put his summer home--Kuzcotopia--there), but he did it out of the kindness of his heart.  I always like characters like that.
If you are a big Disney fan, you should get this even if you haven't seen it.  Or, if you don't want to buy it, rent it.  I guarantee you'll be laughing!
