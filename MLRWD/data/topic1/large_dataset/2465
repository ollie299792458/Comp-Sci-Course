Well is is a toss up, watching this movie or mucking the stalls in the Barn. The money spent for this perhaps would be better spent in the collection plate asking for forgiveness. I am not religious. This movie has inherent value the same as today's fiat currency. The value it carries is what the viewer places in it.

OK I admit I am hard on this movie. Perhaps I am prejudiced for a reason. I place little to no value on channeled information. A movies value comes in the entertainment factor. I am what today some would call a spiritually awakened individual. I remember past lives and the history of this world, what value one might put in that I do not know.

All too often providers of this kind of information place too much value in the socioreligious aspect making the events seem fantastical. Understand that humans tend to place extreme metaphysical value in things they do not understand. There is no such thing as deity, there are only beings who may be more advanced spiritually. Consider that anything else attached is mumbo jumbo. The Gods of religious fame were no more than service to self ego based beings with advanced technology or just plain disinformation provided by religious elite suckering the people they so casually call the flock. No different than the financial Elite suckering rest of the population.

What it the purpose of a Wizards cloak? Is it magical? No not at all. It's value lies in the frame of mind the wearer assumes when donned.

Religion takes the natural and makes it fantastical to sell it to the uneducated and unsuspecting as something godly. Nothing would happen without the Creator yet the phantasmagorical trimmings that religion places on things is just disinformation used to control the flock.
