Went to the cinima today with my wife and 3year old cars fanattic son and 6year old take it or leave it daughter wasn't expecting it to be great be cause of some reveiws I had seen . Must say I enjoyed parts of it but was dissapointed that they used so much violence in cars 2 no need for that cars one was an exelent story with mild country town justus .but cars 2 is full of war style violence and I found my 3 year old lost interest a few times and asked in a concerned voice on more than one occassion why are they doing that and why is Matter dieing etc;Where as with cars 1 he can still watch the entire film without taking his eye's off the screen and has no problem comprehending the story at all.I would not race out and buy the movie like I have with all the other Pixar hit's in the past;Reason being that I don't wish my kids to be influenced by this kind of war like violence in what should have been a more peace loving movie like cars 1 and aimed at the family setting involing a child based ordiance .but somhow they lost sight of this and bough out the guns what a shame.
