For a 1970's movie, well done, this is a well thought out, not original, but different in its approach, with even a big name in the 70's, HAMMER Productions own Peter Cushing, and this time not playing the English Gentleman type.  The action is quick to surface, no pun intended, with the arrival of the "Ghost Ship", the deserted Island, with a three star hotel being used as a hermitage which is keeping a dark secret.  It is well know the NAZI's were big into the occult and this movie tugs on that string throughout the movie.  The acting is above average, to include a character you just want to shoot right off the bat.  The zombies are not the flesh eating kind, but have a more watery grave mentality, which really does make this a different type of zombie film.  The zombies are tame looking for today standards, but do pull of a wierd creepiness which is well captured in the movie.  The movie lacks the blood and gore of most zombie movies, but can hold the audience captive.  A good movie for any zombie lover.
