"The Ten Commandments" is an epic much more fun and watchable than either "The Robe" or "Ben-Hur", both of which are much more serious.  DeMille's flair for the melodramatic and unintentionally campy is apparent in this film. It is bad religion, bad history, and static and pedestrian film-making.  Yet there is something oddly appealing about the film, which has a perennial broadcast run during Easter and Passover.  It reflects the religious conservatism of the 1950's and also the impact of television on the movie industry.  Films needed to be bigger than ever to get people away from the tube, and bigger they were.  "The Ten Commandments" entertains in spite of itself, and because of the tableau-like way many of the scenes were shot, plays very well on TV.  Many of the special effects are fun, but hardly ingenious.  Even at the time, critics complained that there were more matte lines in the waters of the Red Sea than H20!  Even the Pillar of Fire is a cartoon (for an interesting comparison, view DeMille's 1923 version).  The Paramount DVD is well put together with a great garish Technicolor print, yet decidedly short on extras.  There has to be more background material available for a film this famous-  the DVD of "Ben-Hur" is loaded with them.  Still, it's a fun romp through sand and water, as only the Barnum of Filmdom, C. B. DeMille could create.
