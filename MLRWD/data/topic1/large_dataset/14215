I guess the Doors had it right...people are definetely strange. In its own accord and away from the "Halloween franchise" this is a great movie. I really do not understand some people: do they go into a theatre just to see what they expect? I do not understand why they hate this movie so much. It is a great  movie, well written, well executed and with prety good special effects. It approaches the Halloween story from an entirely different angle and this is what I liked most about it. All the idiots screaming "No Mike Myers..." should remember he DIES in the the second installment of the series! Why do they prefer idiotic excuses resurecting a madman I will never know.
H3 is a great movie from the start (if you can get over the No MIke Myers excuse...). It makes you want to watch the rest of it just to find out what is going on and the poor guy in the beggining is as crazy as he is. Then why are these suited guys so strong really? The idea of the movie is totlaly freaky. Just watch it and decide for your selves w/o paying too much attention to the negative reviews out there. After all, these are the same people that liked "Friday the 13 part 104...Jason dies from OLD AGE"! Idiots that the only thing that excites them in a movie is seeing young people die when they are making up...
NO wonder "Reality TV" is so succesful these days!
