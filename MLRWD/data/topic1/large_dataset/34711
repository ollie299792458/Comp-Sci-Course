My title says it all. Theres nothing in this DVD but activists trying to free dolphins and spread propaganda (SAVE FLIPPER). Showing dolphins getting slaughtered is just to shock the audience and its probably what got them the win at the Oscars. Others have stated this as well but we slaughter all sorts of animals for food and its not a pretty sight. Thats why they come in prepared packages all sliced up with out the head, guts and blood. Peoples emotional attachment is whats make one animal fine to eat while another a horrific thought. There are plenty of ""pet"" animals that are eaten all over the world like horses (4 million a year) dogs (3 million a year) cats (2 million a year) rabbits (millions) birds ... etc. There probably isn't an animal on this earth that hasn't been consumed in big or small quantities. I just hope all the 5 star reviewers are vegetarians because it pretty ridiculous to root for this film and then chow down a 1/4 lb burger. Im all for rooting for ones cause but please don't be a hypocrite. The film jump the shark when Richard stated that the dolphin commited suicide in his arms....ROFL....im sorry I couldnt help it. Again its ones attachment that makes them think their animal is special. Another thing that bothered me about these documentaries is that their all white and their all wealthy individuals. Did you see the homes theses fools were living in? Figures, how else can they hop around the world endlessly without having a J O B. Is it entertaining? = NO, Is watching the slaughter of dolphins good? = NO, But is watching any slaughter good?
