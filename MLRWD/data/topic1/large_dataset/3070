I bought this DVD at a movie rental place that was going out of business.  It was selling for two bucks and I grabbed it right away because I had heard of this movie.  It's a really cute movie without being too cliche with the plot.  I'm not going to get much into the plot because so many other reviewers have already posted what the movie is about.  The only complaint that I have is with the subtitles.  One of the main characters, Son, is a Korean student who is in the process of learning Japanese.  However, I wish the subtitles did a better job of indicating whether she is speaking Korean or Japanese.  As someone who speaks a little of both, I found some parts to be endearing...where she is speaking Japanese and accidentally adding Korean words in her speech.  In most cases, there is little indication that the character is speaking Korean at all (especially when she meets an admirer who is Japanese but trying to speak Korean).  Usually, the poor Japanese/Korean speaking is indicated by an ellipsis in the movie.  While this can show that she is struggling with the language, for most people, it might just look like she is speaking slowly.  It's such a tiny complaint and I'm sorry that it's a little nit-picky.  I just feel like some of the charm is lost in the subtitles.
