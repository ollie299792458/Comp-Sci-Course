I've been doing Taebo basic tapes for several years, not advanced, because the basic is more my pace. I'm VERY happy and excited with this one because:
1) more gradual warm-up and transition into workout
2) the pace of it is perfect for beginner to intermediate...I could get through the whole thing without stopping in the middle of any moves but still felt very challenged and burned plenty of calories. IF YOU CAN DO THE OTHER TAEBO BASIC TAPES, YOU CAN DO THIS.
3) on some of the moves that are more difficult and fast ("double time")--he only does 1 or 2 sets so you can keep up with the pace and not have to stop. (on previous tapes, the double time was too fast or too long or awkward, I couldn't even move fast enough to keep up, or my muscles would cramp up. not so on this tape).
4) the music isn't annoying, and has a consistent beat throughout
5) still uses a lot of the same moves from previous tapes, but this one has some new sequences and variety to keep it interesting.
6) If I don't have time for the full 40 minutes, I could stop at 20, 25, 30 and still have burned a lot of calories, and had enough consistent, total body action.
7) more thorough, not-rushed cool-down, with some new tai-chi-like moves/breathing.

No regrets with this purchase. Would highly recommend it.
