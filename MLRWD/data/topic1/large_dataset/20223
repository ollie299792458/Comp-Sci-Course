American Pie 2, We all saw it coming. Yes we did! I mean with the success that American Pie had American Pie 2 had to make alot of profit. So I watched thinking well they better not *** up this one or American Wedding will be pointless. And they did it, they accomplished the goal of making a good sequel. Say that to yourself, Good Sequel. It doesnt sound right.
Well Jim is back again! With Finch, Kevin, Oz and the Stiffmeister. They all have finished their first year of college and are going on a vacation. They all meet each other up at a reunion at Stifflers house. The party is off the hook! Stiffler gets pissed on it so funny. So Kevin calls his brother a few days later to ask him a few questions, so Kev's brother tells him to rent a house at the beach. At the same time Jim gets a phone call from Nadia. She's in New York and she wants to see him. On the internet again? Cumming early again? NO! He's going to invite her up to the beach house.
They get to the house (the gang  (Oz ,Kevin, Finch, Stiffler and Jim)) They get a job there and they have tons and loads of fun they meet a pair of lesbians . They have a party, Jim meets up with Nadia but things DONT go as planned Watch this funny comdey, recommended for all who liked the first.
