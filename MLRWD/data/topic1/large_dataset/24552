To begin, the facts within the movie are inaccurate.  The film attempts to portray a series of opposing forces pulling at Bobby  from different directions; i.e his mother disapproving of his golfing as it detracts from his schooling, and his father encouraging his golfing at the expense of his studies.  This if false, as his mother was really an avid golfer, and the family used to go golfing together quite avidly.

The list goes on with false portrayals of of his tournament play, the nature of his relationship with Walter Hagen, his home life, the nature of his study habits, and even the portrayal of the personality and character of Bobby Jones himself is inaccurate within the film.

As if the above list is not enough to ruin the film, the production of the film was the final straw.

The story line was scattered and choppy.  It didn't flow and if you did not have some prior knowledge of the life of Bobby Jones, you would probably not be able to understand the significance of many of the scenes.

The dialogue was cheesy, the story line was poorly edited, and the facts of Jones' life were both distorted and often outright wrong.

The only positive lights in this film were the scenes of St. Andrews.  But its pretty hard to botch up footage of the greatest golf course in history.
