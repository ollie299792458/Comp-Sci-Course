After reading many of the other Amazon.com reviews of the "Plan 9 From Outer Space" DVD, the consumer MUST be aware there are two different companies that are distributing this movie on DVD.  The first is  PASSPORT which, from all the other reviews seem to say, should be avoided.  Apparently the company has their logo visible on screen the ENTIRE movie  and featurette which follows.  And they also don't even include a chapter  index. The other company which distributes this movie is IMAGE  ENTERTAINMENT.  This is the version I have and THIS is the DVD to get of  "Plan 9".  (The cover of my version is the one Amazon.com has  displayed in the picture above.)  The picture quality is near perfect and  the Dolby Digital Mono sound is excellent.  And. . . .no annoying logo in  the bottom corner of your screen.  While the (seemingly) inferior PASSPORT  version supposedly has a few interviews cobbled together from Tim Burton's  "Ed Wood" press junket, the IMAGE version includes a 111 minute  documentary which includes some of the stars of Plan 9 (including Vampira)  as well as cult horror  directors Sam Raimi and Joe Dante!  It's two movies  for the price of one!  So unless you're a die-hard Johnny Depp fan and NEED  to have a couple of clips of him speaking, the IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT DVD is  the absolute one to purchase.  I believe Amazon.com offers both so just  beware.  And if you're thinking of buying one from an on-line auction make  sure you ask the person selling which version they have. I hope this helps.
