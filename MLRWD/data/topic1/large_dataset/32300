... In this one, there was pleanty of action. The fighting scenes look a lot better and more realistic than the first movie, and Liu Kang's Animality was a good feature. The plot of the movie is basically that Shao Kahan decided to break the rules of the tournament and have it again even though it was not allowed for another generation. He is going to merge the Out World with the real World, and that will kill all of the humans and animals on Earth. 
The movie is great. But there are a few problems. In Mk1, the actors looked a little more like they did in the games.(Like Raiden and Sonya.) Liu Kang was good in the movie, except he did not do any of his signature moves. Every other character did at least one of their moves from the game (Jax with the ground pound, Sonya with the hand stand, Raiden with the shooting into the person... etc.) Why did Johnny Cage have to die so soon? He was funny!!! The fighting scenes were a little bit too long, and I was kind of upset when Sub Zero left and was not seen for the rest of the movie.
Even though the movie had these problems, it was a great movie,...
