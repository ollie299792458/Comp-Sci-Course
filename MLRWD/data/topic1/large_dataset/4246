This movie is a SciFi depiction about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0806508574">Secret Societies</a> and the way they operate that I review about on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0756762812">Secret Messages: Concealment, Codes, and Other Types of Ingenious Communication</a>.

The author probably find out about it and decided to write a screenplay to portrait and maybe make sense of what he discover.  And from the way the movie portrait that they do not know how long the Aliens been around, I can tell that the author does not know as much as I do about these secret societies.

It is a very good depiction of secret societies.  All you have to do is replace "Aliens" with "Secret Societies" & the "Sunglass" that allow the wearer to see the Aliens with a "Secret Message Translator" that allow you to understand these Secret Societies and you are pretty close to it.

When I saw this movie over 20 years ago, I sense some truth to it but was not able to grasp the whole truth.  After 20 years I was able to put it on the review mentioned above.

If you watch this movie and like it, then I would recommend you read my review mentioned above to further stimulate your mind from the stimulation you already got in this movie.

This movie is one of those movie you would want to keep in your movie collections.
