Now, by the time you've read all the reviews and got to this one, you're either a big fan and want to read what other fans think, or you're still  hard pressed. ... All of you who haven't made up your mind, do yourself and  the world a favor; stop being a cheap slob and buy this film already. Don a  fedora, shake up a few martinis and grab the dame that you love. This movie  has everything besides exploding cars and foul language. Sure it's got men  getting shot up, but they have it coming... you see! And sure, there are more  then a few people telling some really huge whoppers to get the ones they  love out of hot water, but who hasn't? And Bogart's got some real slap, not  unlike the back of my hand! This brings back the days when movies had plot,  for you folks out there who aren't in the know... a plot is storytelling  besides something that happens that leads up to a couple explosions at the  end. This is the kind of movie where men are men, women are women, the  crooks are scared, and the only thing thicker then the cigarette smoke is  the tension and chemistry between Bogart and Bacall.  Stop wasting  time: order this movie... Now!
