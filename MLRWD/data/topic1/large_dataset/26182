SPY GAME( 2001) Directed by Tony Scott.

 Starring Robert Redford, David Hemmings, Charlotte Rampling and Brad Pitt.

 Set.......for no good reason other than a Republican was in office.....in 1991, the film tells the story of a CIA agent, on his last day before retirement, learning that a former collegue has been captured by the Red Chinese who will execute him in 24 hours unless something is done. However the Agency is considering writing the rogue agent off so as not to upset a delicate trade negotiation between the US and Red China.

 However to discover just what it is going on, the Agent is questioned by his superiors going over the rogue's career with vignettes in Vietnam, Berlin and Beirut while, at the same time, the agent ponders ways to save him in spite of CIA policy...........

 Nothing much to say. There may some Liberal/commie prop here (It IS Tony Scott) but since it IS Tony Scott that means the film is really just one very long very shallow music video with fast forwards, quick cutting and sweeping pans. The film is actually a spy video anthology with the Vietnam video then the Berlin video and the Beirut video with the Langley, Virginia video acting as the link. The dialogue is that empty sound bite variety in which no one really says anything and there is no content. The film looks great but has the echo of an empty dumpster. There are no performances to evaluate just shots of people walking around determinedly and striking poses.

 Not a bad movie. Not a good movie. Not much of anything at all.

 Background noise to the 21st century.

 A month from now I probably would not be able to tell you a thing about it.
