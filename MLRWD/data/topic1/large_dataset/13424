Won't bother with a synopsis here, just a list of a few things which knocked me out: Marc Lawrence as Cobby: the pockmarked, jumpy, scumbag booze hound, who gives a fabulous performance; the unworldly sexiness of Marilyn Monroe; the unctuous, supercilious Louis Calhern; the moment when Marilyn snuggles up to Calhern and gives him a passionate kiss: creepy stuff this, considering the age difference, and quite daring for 1950; the beautiful black and white photography and dramatic lighting; the powerful closeups which tell so much about the characters; the pathetic Jean Hagen character, who has a bad thing for Sterling Hayden's Dix; the great character actor Anthony Caruso, born 40 years too early for "The Sopranos"; and finally, Sam Jaffe, the Doc, who lingers too long in the truckstop cafe, gazing salaciously at the body of a gyrating teenage girl. The camera actually lingers and moves over her curves, almost caressing her, which is exactly what the Doc is doing, in his dirty mind.

Again, pretty powerful stuff for the time. Don't forget the youthful Strother Martin in the lineup at the beginning of the film. John McIntyre, a few years later in the landmark TV series The Naked City, gives a forceful performance as well, as a tough police commissioner.

Sterling Hayden was the Russell Crowe of his generation. Make sure you see The Killing, an early Kubrick powerhouse movie, also featuring Hayden.
