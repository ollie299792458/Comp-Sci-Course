Something I realized last night while watching Piranha... it's just not as scary as it was when I was a child. I remember watching Piranha and thinking "Oh My God. You're not safe in the rivers or the oceans. If it's not giant sharks it's flesh eating fish". That terrified me.

Don't get me wrong. Piranha is still awesome and a cult classic. This is the first time I viewed Piranha since I was a child. I did it because I want to see the original before they release the remake on DVD this month.

One thing that got me laughing was the noise the Piranha made when attacking. That shrill little mini-lawnmower sound. I laughed so hard.

What I loved was the fact that nothing was taboo. They went after and attacked small children. Awesome. Most horror or cult classics don't go there. Piranha did. Kids swimming in the lake... who cares? Send the Piranha in and let 'em feast.

Thank goodness it's all in fun.

What really gets me is seeing a Piranha in real life. They say that Piranha are NOTHING like the movies portray them as. There is only one type of Piranha that can do the damage like in the movies... the Red-Bellied Piranha.

Mostly real piranha eat what they can from fish to dead animals floating in the water and rarely attack humans... kinda like the Great White Sharks being compared to Jaws.

So Piranha seem to have the same fear factor as a Great White Shark does. All because of the movies. There is a small chance of being hurt by Piranha or a Great White Shark. However, the likeliness of this happening is slim.

But it is one reason to watch yourself every time you get in the water, huh?
