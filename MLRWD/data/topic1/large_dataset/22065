This film once again brings us Bruce Willis as Lieutenant John McClane, who gets involved in investigating cyber-terrorism and a young hacker named Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) and cyber-terrorist Timothy Gabriel (played by Timothy Olyphant). At the start of the film, McClane is having some estrangement problems with his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who prefers to use her mother's maiden name of Gennaro instead of her given name. At the start of the film, 7 computer hackers are murdered when they hit delete on their keyboards, which sets off explosives. McClane is asked to escort Matthew to Washington, D.C. to the FBI's Washington Headquarters. Apparently, Farrell has unwittingly helped Gabriel, and Gabriel has his henchmen attempt to kill McClane and Farrell, but they fail. McClane and Farrell make it to D.C., but are immediately under attack from Gabriel, whose hackers control the traffic signals and cause chaos. They also hack into other systems and make it seem like there is an anthrax attack. All this occurs on the Fourth of July. Action abounds in this one, basically non-stop. The main hacker for Gabriel is Mah Lin (Maggie Q). After a series of narrow escapes, on Farrell's advice, he and McClane find the Warlock a master hacker, Farrell's contact, portrayed by filmmaker Kevin Smith. The action in this movie is VERY solid and absolutely thrilling. I will not reveal too much more, but it is an absolute thrill-ride that doesn't let go. A VERY worthy sequel, but make sure you get the Unrated DVD. 4 3/4 stars for this one.
