"Happy Days" was one of the most popular television series in the 1970s. The premise focused on Richie Cunningham, a high school kid living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the 1950s. Everyone knows about Fonzie, Potsie, Ralph Malph and the Cunninghams. What most people forget is the serie's initial focus was on the relationship between Richie and Potsie. In fact, the premise for "Happy Days" arose from an episode on "Love, American Style," entitled "Love and the Happy Day." That episode also featured Ron Howard in Richie's role.
The first season of "Happy Days" features several differences from its later incarnation, especially as it involves the role of the Fonz. The Fonz was NOT a major character in the initial shows. Watch these episodes and notice he wore a white--not black--jacket. Also, Fonz never strayed far from his motorcycle. And, of course, there's also the matter of Richie's older brother, Chuck, who simply disappeared after a few episodes. 
I'm a fan of "Happy Days," and I think some of the serie's stronger writing and more memorable episodes are from the first couple seasons. I especially like the first season, which for some reason maintains a poignancy that the show lost as it became enormously popular. 
At this time, it doesn't appear that any commentary will accompany the dvds. It doesn't matter to me because this season stands on its own. Five stars.
