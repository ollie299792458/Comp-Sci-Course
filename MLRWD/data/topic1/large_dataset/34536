This is it. This is the only Twilight Zone release you'll ever need. All 150+ episodes have been restored and retransfered from either pristine 35mm camera negatives, or in the case of six episodes from season 2, 2" Quad Videotape (including the Christmas show "Night of the Meek" which for years has only been seen in a kinescope transfer). Aside from some weird glitches (the mag tracks seem to have been damaged for a few episodes, and the telecine transfer on "Cavender is Coming" is extremely wobbly), these definitive edition tansfers may look even better than they were original broadcast in the late 50's-early 60's. There is also hours upon hours of bonus features such as scene specific commentary featuring the cast and non-scene specific "commentary" in the form of actual recordings of Rod Serling (who passed away sadly in 1975) discussing his work on the Zone to a bunch of college students. All the extras from the individual sets are duplicated here, save for the reprint of Mark Scott Zicree's Twilight Zone Companion book included in the original printing (now OOP) of Season 1 (but that's available separately and is therefore no great loss), so there isn't that feeling of being cheated out like some recent complete series box sets.

At 136 dollars, this may seem a little steep for Zone novices (yes I know there are some still out there) but it really is a bargain for any fan of golden age television and or science fiction.

Addendum: The copy I received is apparently a re-repackaging of this set. When the Complete Definitive Edition Set was released in 2006 (following the single season sets), it recieved complaints for its fragile cheaply made digipak packaging. The most recommended negative review on Amazon is based largely on the crappy packaging. However... for this revised version, they've switched out the digipaks for much stronger keepcases, and now it even takes up less space than its predecessor! Way to go Image!
