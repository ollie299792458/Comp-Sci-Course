I have been for years a fan of the French illustrator Jean "Moebius" Giraud, and always felt his visual style would translate well into film, particularly science fiction. Well, I couldn't have been more delighted when I first saw Fifth Element, to see his name in the credits. This is a film that, as much as anything else, concerns itself with visual splendour and eccentricity. It's a wild ride, and it's worth taking.
While the film was soundly panned by the (North) American critics, I remain convinced that Americans just don't get the French sensibility, and the wry sense of humour that seems to pervade many French films. I keep waiting for the Hollywood remake of this, a film that will no doubt take itself too seriously, be too ponderous, and find some way to be overly sentimental.
Besson gives us a real treat - great looking people, great looking sets, over the top performances and things that go bang. I don't think there is another country in the world that would give us a film in which an ex-professional wrestler gets to play the president.
The film was criticized for being "eye-candy". Go see it, and remember that it doesn't just want to be eye-candy, it wants to be the best eye-candy you've ever had. Enjoy yourself, and remember that there's nothing wrong with the odd guilty pleasure.
