After seeing this in the theater when it was first released, I hesitated to see it again because I was afraid it might not hold up on a second viewing.  Well, not only is it worth seeing a second time; it's definitely worth owning.  George Clooney plays his role perfectly, and the rest of the cast does a fine job, too.

Of course no one knows what actually happened aboard the Andrea Gail.  This film's script speculates because that is all it can do, but the result is a riveting adventure.  I was especially pleased to come away feeling that those responsible for getting the technical details right did their jobs.  I know how to turn a boat in heavy seas.  That's how you do it, yes!  I also know how a man who makes his living on the sea reacts to getting hit in the face with salt spray as he holds his course.  He laughs.  He's having a ball.  Of course that part's from before things get frightening, but it's spot on.  I know because my dad followed the sea, and I've watched him do just what George Clooney was doing in portraying his character.

A few weak spots?  I'm sure they are there.  But for me they flew straight past.  Five stars and glad to give them!
