The special effects are cheesy. The "surprise" is no surprise. And yet this film holds the attention far better than most films with far fewer obvious klinkers and on far higher budgets.

The film's premise is the same as in "Siesta" and "Sixth Sense": the heroine is dead. She doesn't know she is dead. That premise is not obvious in "Sixth Sense," becomes obvious in "Siesta" when the protagonist jumps from a roof, but is obvious here early in the film when she emerges out of nowhere from a muddy river after her car overturned and fell into it three hours earlier.

Our dubious heroine then embarks on a journey interrupted by visions of the dead and demented. Though thoroughly cheesy, the images of the un-dead are effective, and the owner of the boarding house looks as though she recently escaped from an asylum. The disorientation that the film-maker would have us associate with death is chilling. When the "secret" is revealed at film's end, the breathing of the two obviously living actresses is a welcome relief, and a fitting end to one of the best "stinkers" on film.

This film is very much like a good ride at a carnival: nothing to ponder for long, but a marvelous ride. The Criterion print is superb as usual.
