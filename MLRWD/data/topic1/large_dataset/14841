This movie is just superb!
With its bone chilling tale of Boyd (Guy Pearce) as a cowardly general who helped and betrayed his squad at the same time is shipped off to California. 
 He arrives only to find his co-workers are a bunch of freaks and weirdoes. Then one night a drifter (Robert Carlyle) is found half dead near there base. He survives only to tell them that two other people are trapped in a cave somewhere in the open and there both hungry cannibals!!
Boyd is later informed about a tale of cannibalism that when one eats the flesh of another he absorbs his strength and ability.
When they arrive at the cave they are all betrayed by the stranger and find out that he killed and ate them all! And he has no regrets about doing the same to them. 
A few notes on this amazing movie:
1. Guy Pearce is too underrated and is one of my favourite actors and definitely one of the best out there and delivers once again an amazing performance in this motion picture.
2. Robert Carlyle also gives an amazing performance as an intelligent twisted villain.
3. AMAZING ending
4. For other amazing Guy Pearce performances go see L.A. Confidential and Memento
