I would have given this movie 5 stars instead of 1.This is without a doubt the scariest movie ive ever seen in my life.it was originaly released in 1985.the reason im giving it one star.is the movie demons on dvd,is not the exact same movie released on vhs video in 1985.they have redone it on dvd.and taken mosalot of the gore and hard rock out of the movie.The reason is Anchor bay.the movie was originaly distibuted by new world video.then anchor bay got there hands ahold of this mordern marvel of terror and redone the movie,they cut out alot of the gore,alot of the original rock music was completely taken out,when the womans on the theatre stage and transforming into a demon.you see a bright lite shot on her and you can see when her tounge shoots out thats its a mechanical pupet.in the orginal the lighting was kept dark and they may have been the reason.If you are one of the lucky ones to hold the original 1985 release of DEMONS on vhs from new video you have without a doubt the scariest horror movie of all time.If your one of the unfortunate ones to get the new dvd you will be left in the dark on what was once a true horror gem.i happen to have the 1985 copy of demons.released in the aqctuall year of 1985.i vdieo store went out of buisness in my home town.i remember the day they got it in 1985 like it waqs yesterday.i purchased the some 20 year old copy from them in 2001.my copys about had it its 21 years old..i wwish i could find an oruginal copy.cause u nolonger can get it now.i wonder if they have done the same things to demons 2 the nightmare returns i wonder if they cut and edited it 2...talk about being crapped on....IF YOUR LOOKING FOR THE ORIGINAL demons first off saty away from the dvd.go for teh video and make sure it says 1985 on it and not 1999 on the side...
