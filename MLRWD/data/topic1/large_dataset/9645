Or do it the other way around, like I did.  I liked the Will Smith movie a lot, but I saw it on opening night with surly teenagers who left still asking what was so 'great' about Ali.
This movie has the answer.  While the Will Smith "Ali" is definitely worth seeing and covers a lot of ground not touched in this 1996 documentary, "When We Were Kings" does a far better job of accurately conveying the climate of the 1970s and the aura surrounding the fight.  It shows how whites and blacks viewed themnselves and each other and how we in America and around the world vested the fights between Ali and his major opponents, Foreman and Frazier with mythic importance.
The menacing inarticulate George Foreman of the 1970s will be a revelation to those who only know him as the cuddly HBO commentator and pitchman trying to sell us grills and mufflers.
Again, the 2001 Will Smith movie is fine for those of us who already know the story.  Will Smith has the lines down pat, and credibly imitates some of Ali's ring style.  But this is the movie young people who weren't around back then to see, to grasp the essence of Muhammed Ali, and the significance my generation invested in him.  I'm going out to rent it again and show it to my kids this weekend.
