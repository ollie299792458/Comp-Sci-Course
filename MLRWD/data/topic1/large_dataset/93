Being the parent of an autistic child and volunteering in a disability ministry, I must confess that I was disappointed by the portrayals in this film.  Radio is unrealistic.  He can do no wrong.  When he does wrong, someone put him up to it.  It's hard to believe that he comes out of his shell and starts talking so fluently so quickly. I personally know people of varying degrees and types of disability, and they have bad sides.  Based on Radio's portrayed developmental level, they would poke through more clearly. People like this need to be trained out of those behaviors, or they will become nuisances to themselves and society. The principal of the school looks and acts like she is straight out of the 2000s. The coach's daughter was a flat character who was a little whiny. It is hard to believe that the students who once persecuted him would turn so nonchalantly into his adoring allies.  Additionally, wasn't there a law by 1976 that said special education was a mandatory offering in the public schools?  Why wasn't he in school before?  Also, it is unclear exactly how Radio helps the team.  The team only goes .500.  There is no sense of triumph or overcoming adversity to achieve greatness like there was in the great "Remember the Titans." I believe the film set out to be like "Titans,"(which I heartily recommend instead) but it seems like a low budget effort with blunders here there and everywhere.  I suggest "Rain Man" also.
