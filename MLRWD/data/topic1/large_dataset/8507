I have been a huge fan of Mel Brooks since first viewing Spaceballs several years ago. This is the type of deal I have been waiting for to come out. And yes, I have also been waiting for Robin Hood: Men in Tights to come out on DVD. Now that someone finally has, I'm going to buy that boxset the day it comes out. Despite that I own Blazing Saddles, History of the World: Part 1, and Young Frankenstein (and Spaceballs, but that's not in the set), I will still buy boxset since of the other 4 discs, only Robin Hood have I seen. I've wanted to see the others, but they're extremely hard to find on DVD. It's very hard to find most of Mel Brooks' movies on DVD, and I know because I've tried my hardest! Yes, you can find them online but I've had issues with online buying that has forced me to ceaseany more online purchasing. Anyways, I have yet to see a movie by Mel Brooks that I have not liked. I thought the new Producers movie was good but I heard the old one was better, though I have yet to see that one yet as well. To conclude, Even if Robin Hood is your main objective in this boxset, all the other movie either are or have got to be just as good. Mel Brooks is a genious in his work and I say buy his products; I know I will and have!
