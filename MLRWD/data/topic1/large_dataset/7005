This movie was awesome! My family and I enjoyed this movie, it was funny, clean, inspiring, and to us a moral. We laughed, and laughed, and said what a great movie! This movie is clean fun for the whole family!

We felt like this movie taught a good moral while keeping the entertainment going. I could not believe that this movie was this good due to all the bad reviews.. We found this movie for a $1.00 or $2.00 and said for that price even if it is bad we will not lose much.

We popped the movie in and to our surprise the story line was awesome!  The characters did an awesome job, the scenery was also good, I love the Christmas calendar and we are now searching for our own.

Well I don't want to give much of the movie away, but we left the movie inspired and will remember to always treat others as we want to be treat and respect others... Great moral... we already practice this, but thanks for the reminder.

This will be a great addition to any Christmas movie collection!

Happy viewing!
