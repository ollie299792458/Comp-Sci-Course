Anyone who seriously dislikes this film is without the ability to feel.  I will stand by that whole-heartedly until someone can tell me why I'm wrong.
If not, they're just squeamish.  Requiem is a glimpse of what happens when hope clouds the mind and narrows one's line of sight.  The message of the film, much misinterpretted by the majority of the reviewers on this site, is not blatantly anti-drug.  All four protagonists are driven by dreams, working toward happiness the only way they know how.  None of them stops to think about the means by which they are trying to get there; the ends they desire will justify anything they have to do along the way.  Or will they?
Aronofsky's cinematography is fantastic.  His "hip hop montages" that string together the parallel plots are aurally and visually refreshing, although semi-reminiscient of Pi's pill-popping sequences.  The soundtrack is gorgeous and deeply moving, most notably the chilling "Summer Overture" that begins and ends the film.  Everything about the movie is beautiful.  Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, and Jennifer Connelly pull off their parts superbly.  Hell, Marlon Wayans is surprisingly incredible as Ty, Harry(Leto)'s right hand man.  I can't say enough about the quality of this film.
There are scenes that, no matter how often I replay them, strike a chord within me that brings a wave of tears to my eyes.  The emotion is the real star of the story.  Do yourself a favor and watch it.  If you are not deeply moved, scarred, or changed by it in any way, please tell me how, because I simply cannot understand.
