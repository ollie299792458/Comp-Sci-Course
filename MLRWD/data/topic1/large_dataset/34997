I purchased this after reading the book, which I found charming and was anxious to see it on screen. I am a fan of both Colin Firth and Reese Witherspoon, so despite some of the poor reviews of their acting in this film, I went ahead and purchased the movie. I should've listened to those reviews however, because Firth plays a horrid Jack Worthing! He plays Worthing the same way he played Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, which is all wrong for Jack's character. And as much as I like Reese Witherspoon, she just didn't catch the essence of Cecily at all. The dialog - which was sharp and witty in my head reading the play - is just dead in this movie version. Too slow for sure, but it's missing something else, almost like the actors just didn't "get" the humor (maybe forgivable for Witherspoon, who is American, but what is Firth's excuse?), or maybe it had to do with the director, I don't know, but the fact remains this movie just doesn't "work." The tattoo scene, especially, which is not in Wilde's play, struck me as a bad attempt at perhaps adding a little sex appeal to draw a younger crowd. Was there anything to smile about in this movie version? Rupert Everett played a pretty good Algy, as did Tom Wilkinson as Dr Chasuble and Anna Massey as Miss Prism. The sets were beautiful, but none of this makes up for the lack of spark among the main actors (particularly Firth and Witherspoon) and the mishandling of the dialog.
