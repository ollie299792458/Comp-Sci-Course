I thoroughly enjoyed The Amityville Horror.  This came out at a time when horror/suspense films were in their heydey.  James Brolin was quite good as George Lutz. Margot Kidder & Rod Steiger also did an excellent job in the film.  I'm pleased to have it to my collection.  The DVD was clear & crisp. The sound quite sharp.  There were (I think) seven radio spots, a commentary also, as well as the original theatrical trailer (& I think a documetary segment which I haven't seen yet).

Overall, MGM did justice to the release of the movie.
The back cover states widescreen, yet after watching the DVD, I can say for a fact that it was indeed a pan & scan with no options anywhere in the menu for any widescreen option which I would have preferred.

In any event, as the film was so good & the clarity & audio of the DVD were looking quite nice, I'd say it deserves a five star rating, so I'm giving it one (Another reviewer said things were slow in developing momentum before the happenings began in the movie.  I can't really agree.  Within the first 12-15 minutes we see Rod Steiger as the priest there to bless the house, covered in bees.  From that point onwards, the pace was rather fluid.  I also like when films are gradual about picking up the momentum.  It all adds to the suspense & anticipation & gives the characters time to become established within the plot).
