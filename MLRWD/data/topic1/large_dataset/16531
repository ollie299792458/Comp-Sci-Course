Easy A is about Olive, an average high-school girl who, to get out of a camping trip with her best friend, decides to make up a lie that she's going out with a college guy that weekend.  After the rumor spins out of control as the school's Christian mean girl gets a hold of it, she tells everyone!  Olive decides to use the rumor as an advantage as people pay her to say that she slept with them.

Easy A is a fantastic movie.  It's a comedy-drama that's a mix of the witty dialogue of Juno (You'll be quoting the movie after you're done) with the theme of popularity from Mean Girls along with the Christianity of Saved!  The character's are extremely likable.  Emma Stone and Amanda Bynes are probably the best characters in this movie along with Olive's parents.  The plot deals greatly on today's issues of sexuality and the pressure's of having sex before you're ready.  The ending felt rushed but, the rest of the movie was so well done, it didn't have an effect on the rating.  I give this movie an Easy five stars!

The special features included on the DVD and Bluray seem like a great extra for the lovers of this movie.
