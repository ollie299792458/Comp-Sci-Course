I can't help but give this movie five stars. I've read some of the reviews about the building of a backstory making it dull. I'm definitely of a different view. I think building on the backstory of the main character, giving the villains and supporting characters their own interesting connections, twists, and intrigues, and the reflection on the crusades just gives the story that much more weight and, in my opinion, realism. Otherwise it would be just a classic everyday fairy tale, a la Disney's version of the legend.

And I agree with the editorial that Costner's lack of accent is a small distraction. Personally I think he fit the role just fine; I think that lightweight nonchalance about his acting serves well to keep the movie from bogging down and taking itself too seriously.

Mary Elizabeth Masterantonio was an excellent choice. She performs with a forceful confidence that really gives her character the strength to just light up the screen.

And if anything I would give the movie 5 stars for Alan Rickman's performance alone. He brings that wit and touch of goofiness to his role that creates a villain that's just a blast to watch.

In general, it was well-paced and well-balanced between fun and seriousness. And, unlike many Old World adventure-romance movies that Hollywood's been cranking out these days, it's relatively short.
