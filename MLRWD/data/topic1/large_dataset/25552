This film is not about cloning, we can already do that and it's a boring premis for a film. No, this movie is about the ability to store one's memmory/emotions/mind/Being onto a medium and writing it back into a body; the ability to live beyond the body and become immortal.  In many ways like you can find in e.g. the Neuromancer trilogy by William Gibson, this is a modern classic SF theme and is handled in an interesing way from different perspectives. I enjoyed the doctors view (Duval) and liked the tycoon vs. tycoon bits. There is some good stuff here.
Too bad they decided to say that it's all about cloning (hey, people will understand that, right?) and even worse that apart from the above EVERYTHING ELSE is a mess. Bad dialogues, a father who suddenly murders without any remorse, mindless technological gadget-madness. And why does every dumb SF-movie abuse the terms virtual and hologram? Also, the situation with two identical Arnie's is poorly resolved at the end.
This movie has more good storyelements than Bladerunner but that movie benefitted from an inspired director and a good crew (and a director's cut). Here, everything seems to have gone downhill after the first draft. Sure, it still entertains, I enjoyed it, but most of all, it's a crying shame this movie didn't turn out better. This could have been a classic.
