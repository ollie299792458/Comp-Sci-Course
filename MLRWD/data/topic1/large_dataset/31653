I am sure it is just coincidence, but this week's Gospel in Church is about how an enemy has sown weeds into the field of the Master's wheat (see Mt 13:24-43). I think one of the messages of the reading(s) is "patience" with the world, with others, and with ourselves. Frequently, we are little aware of the weeds that have taken root in our lives, although we are quick to see them in others. All the while the weeds can have a dominating affect on the good we also possess.

I was reminded how this movie is a good example of this message & more. Michael Ober had more than a few negatives overshadowing his life. The Touhy family, especially in the form of Sandra Bullock, was able to see the good, in spite of all else, and enable Michael not only to look past it, but to excel. Most already know the ending before watching the movie: success in the form of college, scholarship, All-American and NFL. Not bad for someone who was abandoned only years prior.

In this true story, credit must be given to John Lee Hancock for his great directing. I suppose the final product would not be what it is without great editing also (mentioned in other reviews). I found Sandra Bullock an essential ingredient in the movie. She was terrific! I never saw her in such a role, but her acting does the job. It is an incredible film: with all the anguish & excitement!
