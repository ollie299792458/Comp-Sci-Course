Like the title of my review says, the first Bourne movie is still the best, at least as far as the film itself goes. I did enjoy the final film in the trilogy quite a bit (especially when compared to the second movie) but the first film is still the most fun and the most impactful. With a story like the one surrounding the ill-fated Jason Bourne, it's tough to top the character's journey in this first movie, where he slowly discovers what he can do, what he is and finally who he is.

The movie tells the story of one Jason Bourne, found floating in the middle of the ocean with an pretty basic case of amnesia. After being dropped off in Europe, he discovers he has skills and abilities that no normal person should have. With the help of a woman whom he offers $20,000 to drive him to Paris, Bourne slowly uncovers clues to his past while being chased by CIA operatives and several black ops agents with skills similar to his.

The high-definition transfer of this fast-paced thriller is pretty darn good. It's not a pristine reference-quality disc, but it's not very easy to find HD movies that look a whole lot better than this one. The level of detail is high, the film lacks overt amounts of graininess, and there is nary a sign of compression artifacts to distract from one's enjoyment of the action unfolding. It's one of the better HD movies I've had the pleasure of watching. I have no trouble recommending a purchase.
