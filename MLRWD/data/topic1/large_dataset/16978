Alfred Hitchcock once said, "Drama is life with all the dull bits taken out." I believe that is true, and because I think that, I have to say that there is no way this could ever truly be classified as "drama". Somebody opted to do just the opposite and leave all the dull bits IN. I wonder what you would call that.
I give this three stars only because Tyrone Power did look pretty groovy in the Indian outfits, and the "cute little moustache and the big dark eyes" added to the effect. Otherwise I would have taken off two stars and given it one because I couldn't give it less. 
One thing that was interesting was how George Brent really reminded me of Rhett Butler, meaning that he could have taken Clark Gable's role and been equally effective. Something about him in this movie. Don't know what exactly... because I've seen him in other movies and he never struck me as a Rhett possibility.
Myrna Loy did so many better roles... in The Best Years of Our Lives, The Bachelor and the Bobby-soxer, and even Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House was made tolerable because her role was the best one. Here she wasn't anything much. 
None of the characters were very well-developed and I would have liked to have seen more Henry Travers. Oh well. All I can say is... maybe you'll like this movie more than I did. I just can't recommend it very highly somehow...
