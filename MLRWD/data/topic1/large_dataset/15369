I guess what this one has over the rest, besides Sean Connery, is realism.  There is nothing fancy here, no castles and armies that really never existed, but what actually probably would have happened in a period where resources were scarce and people relatively few.

This is the story of Robin Hood after his return and disilussionment of the Crusades.  The charcater of King Richard is excellent and one gets a feeling of hopelessness and waste brought on by the crusades, and we see an older Robin Hood who wants nothing more than to return home and to Marian.

However, people do not change, and Robin Hood fights battles when he arrives home that no one asked him to, including Marian.  This leads to the realistic conclusion of what happens when one tries to fight the man.

What is also great about this movie is the depth of the character of the Sheriff.  In most of the Robin Hood lore he is two-dimensional evil character, and in this movie he is much more realistically depicted as a beleagured bureaucrat that actually attempts to defend Robin Hood initially until Robin Hood crosses lines that cannot be backed away from.

Excellent.
