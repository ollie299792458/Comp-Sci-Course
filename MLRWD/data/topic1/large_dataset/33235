If you don't this concert you have been living on the moon too long. R30 is a visual and audio orgason that you will never forget. Geddy Lee has never sounded better. He has not lost anything. Alex Lifeson is superb on the guitar. I don't know of any other guitar player his age that sounds better. Neil Peart has the largest arrangement of drums and other instruments that I have ever seen in a concert. He plays them with the best performace of passion that I have ever seen. The video on the large screen in back of the band plays a variety of cartoons and other pleasurable images. On stage is 2 cloths dryers and a vending machine? After the break Geddy empties the cloths in the dryer into the audience. The audio is soo good that I actually had to turn my surround down to 25 or 26. I usually have to turn it up to 32 to 38 for some concerts. 4 stars is the most you can rate it I give it 10 stars and then some. Also the lighting is great for an inside concert. Rush don't walk to buy this magnificent concert.
