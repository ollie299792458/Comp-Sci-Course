I first saw this movie when it originally came out 9 years ago. I was 14 back then, and though the subject matter was a little mature for me then, I still loved it. Today 23, this movie is still one of my favorites. Though the twists are old and the laughs predictable, it's still a great movie and is especially fantastic when watched with someone who has never seen it before!

Being general, the movie is--in my opinion--a sophisticated comedy. From the very first twist until the final turn at the end, this movie holds one's attention! There's sex, slapstick, and dark comedy, but it all comes together very well in my opinion. Rotten Tomatoes gave this movie a 52% because of the consensus that the movie was long, the romantic subplot did not fit well, and the characters were unsympathetic. I disagree on all three counts, but I also believe the third is irrelevant; this film is cut from the same cloth as Liar, Liar and went to the school of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. It's fun, entertaining, and clever. Definitely 5 stars in my book.
