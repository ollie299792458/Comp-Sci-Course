The Zionist public relations machine is the best in the world at manipulation, discrediting other nations, diminishing the history of others while inflating their own, and distorting Historical facts. They, along with the English and Dutch (research the Paper Wars against Spain in the 16th century) have been masters at the art of deception and propaganda for more than 500 years. Moreover, this film is nothing more than brainwashing and perpetuating the Black Legend and anti-Catholic sentiment in our country by stealth indoctrination carefully woven in mindless entertainment (a very effective Zionist tool).

The Black Legend against Spain is part of a vast movement started by the enemies of the Faith to destroy the Catholic religion. It is not an isolated case; other Catholic countries like Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Poland have had their reputations smeared for their adhesion to the Faith. The Black Legend seeks to throw discredit upon the Faith by building biases and prejudices against Catholicism. A current example of these attacks are Dan Brown's books "The Da Vinci Code" and "Angels & Demons", a malevolent cocktail of fake scholarship, lies and half-truths. It seeks to instill in Catholics a sense of embarrassment and shame about the way in which their ancestors lived and practiced their faith. The effect is subtle but too often ends by Roman Catholics then doubting the truth of the Faith.
