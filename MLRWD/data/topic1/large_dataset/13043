Let's face it--with all of the technology and computer generated this and that in today's movies,there's just not much we haven't seen or heard.Shock value and slick packaging sell movies,and sometimes the plot is so full of holes you could drain pasta through it.So if you're sick of the same ol'--same ol',please,read on.
  Made in 1977,"The Car" is what I call a "REAL" movie.Yes-they really built a custom car based on a Lincoln;in fact,there were 7 of them made for this movie,and torn apart for this movie--real crashes and it can't be duplicated by a computer--it's just not the same.
  Simple plot--for whatever reason,the car comes screaming out of the desert to kill and terrorize the people of a small town in New Mexico.James Brolin plays the deputy of the town and deals with the intruder personally,and all hell breaks loose when he discovers the truth--there is no driver.
  If you have a decent imagination,this movie is terrifying when you think about "What if?".If your imagination isn't that great,don't worry.The chase scenes and tension will keep you on the edge.The engine sounds alone are worth the viewing for any gear-head.And the air horn on the car that blasts during each attack are unforgetable.
  So if you are craving a "REAL" movie that will leave you chilled,get
"The Car". I believe it is one of the most under-rated movies of the '70's;I saw it the first time as a child and have been lucky enough to catch it on television once or twice and it still gets me.And ,yes,I have recently found and purchased a copy for my collection.If you are in to horror,you won't be dissapointed.
