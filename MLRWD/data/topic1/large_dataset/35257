This is a good film that is creatively shot(CSI style crime sequences)and excellently acted. Val Kilmer turns in another great performance(looking almost identical to his Jim Morrison persona in the Doors)as the legendary king of porn John Holmes. All the supporting cast turn in great performances as well but the movie mostly revolves around Holmes and his misadventure. One person asked what are we supposed to feel about Holmes? If this film is said to have done one thing, let it be said to have not had any biased lookout on events. You see every person's account and you see stuff as it happened. Holmes and most every living person got off very easy and he and his woman driving off into the sunset for Florida really happened so as for what you are "supposed to feel" is up to each individual's perception. The DVD contains great extra features and the real crime scene footage. The movie also sports a great soundtrack featuring Iggy Pop and the Cars to name but a few. Anyways highly reccomended to those that saw Boogie Nights and wondered what happened after or anybody who is intrested in the Wonderland murders.
