I just wanted to chime in real quick.  A lot of people are knocking this movie for it's overly glossy looking CGI heavy effects.  Well I thought the same thing while watching the film, but if you check out the special features you'll discover that much of what you thought was CGI was actually done by more traditional special effects that have always been around.  I was seriously impressed to discover this and much kudos has to go to the director and producers for being able to pull off so much without having to offer a sacrifice to the great CGI god.

And seriously, this movie is not trying to be Citizen Kane or Casablanca so stop judging it like that.  It's just pure fun and adrenaline.  Seriously, do you sit there parsing every single comic book and graphic novel you read trying to figure out if it could hold up as real life?  Get over it already.  This is fantasy for crying out loud!

Also check out the director's other works: "Night Watch" & "Day Watch," also great fun, but again, just try not to dig too deep into the plot or you'll get a massive headache.  These movies are just meant to be thrill rides I think.  Oh BTW, don't mind the subtitles in those other 2 films.
