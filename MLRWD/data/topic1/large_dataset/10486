Charade has it all: Mystery, romance, suspense, and a lot of dry, witty humor throughout. There is a magical quality to Grant and Hepburn's on screen chemistry. In this short review, I want to make a clear distinction between two of the available versions. Charade This edition, by Madacy, is a good quality product. It has good picture and sound and it will not disappoint those who watch it on an old fashioned standard picture tube. This is the one that most people buy and it is the best value for the money, especially as a used product.  However, if you have an big screen HDTV like I do, you will see flaws in the picture due to a lower-resolution scan. You know what I mean, like a slightly compressed JPEG file on your computer. For those with a hi-def big screen TV, you must go for the Criterion Collection <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001J3SVI">Charade - Anamorphic Widescreen Edition (Criterion Collection Spine #57)</a>. It is well worth the extra money for the clearest, cleanest possible picture and sound for large HDTV viewing.  So which to choose from?  It all depends on what kind of TV you have. I hope I have helped you to make the right choice for you. It's a great movie and I know you will love it!
