This is my favourite Bond movie and I have seen them all. Here are some of its assets:

- Great locations: Egypt, Sardinia, makes you want to be there as well
- The best Bond villain: Jaws
- A sexy and intelligent Bond girl + a sexy and ruthless female villain, Naomi (her role should have been longer)
- One of the best enemy hideouts, Atlantis, a giant waterworld fortress and the inside of a huge oil tanker
- The sets inside Atlantis and the tanker don't have this cheap plastic filmset look that you have in the enemy hideouts of the earlier Connery movies
- Roger Moore delivering his strongest performance
- The gadgets are also great, especially the Lotus Esprit that also functions as a submarine
- Bond's love interest nearly is his equal in her abilities, not some Bimbo, like in many other Bond movies

All in all, a great movie, I've probably watched it dozens of times with a cask of beer and some crackers, always makes a great Bond evening
