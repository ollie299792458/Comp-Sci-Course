I saw Not Without My Daughter long ago and at the time a remember feeling very compassionate with Betty Mahmood, seeing her as a victim of a culture, entirely alien to her. Betty is forced to fight with all means possible to escape Iran and keep her young daughter with her after she discovers that her husband, an Americanized Iranian, has decided to stay in Iran during their visit and adopt and impose on her the local culture and way of life. Although I found the film very interesting and provocative, I always wondered about the accuracy of the real environment that was portrayed in the film.

Recently I saw an Iranian film, The Day I Became A Woman, which contained an entirely different perspective from Not Without My Daughter.  The most obvious difference was that The Day I Became A Woman is an Iranian film, directed by an Iranian female director, Marziyeh Meshkini. It focuses on very realistic and really common events in the life of the Iranian woman.  Surprisingly enough, I found that these women had much more in common with the character of Betty Mahmood, than any of the other female characters in Not Without My Daughter. They had the will, the desire, strength and determination, just like Betty. Seeing The Day I Became A Woman really made me aware of the cultural blindness that I have been exposed to by the dominance of the American film.

 I was very happy to find out that The Day I Became a Woman is coming out on DVD in US, because this is exactly what we as Americans need to see in order to be able to understand a different culture, which, as this movie shows, is not all that different.  There is a web site about this film,  thedayibecameawoman.com , which should have the release date, so please a keep an eye on it.  It was a real eye-opener for me.
