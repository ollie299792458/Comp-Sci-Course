I finished watching this movie about an hour and a half ago and still find my eyes welling up with tears. Unable to visit the theatre, I eagerly awaited it's arrival on DVD. Being the center of so much controversy, I couldn't wait to see the movie and decide for myself. I am truly amazed. Heath Ledger pulled off his most amazing performance in this film. And Jake Gyllenhaal...wow...I admit I haven't seen many movies of his but I will now. Brokeback Mountain has to be one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen. The subject of the movie has made some of my family members a bit uncomfortable when I've expressed my desire to see it but I've never seen such a beautiful story. The emotion throughout the entire movie was so strong...I was moved to tears several times (and that does NOT often happen to me during movies) The conflicts, the passion, the obvious love the two felt for each other..so wonderfully portrayed by the actors made the movie all the more amazing. And the ending! Oh! I won't give anything away...but the shirt..that's what got me. Thinking about it even now, almost two hours later, tears. Such a beautiful movie. Everyone should see it. Tugs at the heart and gives some of the best performances I've seen in a very long time.
