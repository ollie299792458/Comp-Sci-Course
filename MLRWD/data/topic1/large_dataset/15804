I am a christian. I wouldnt consider myself a hardcore christian, but I am christian nonetheless. I wasnt sure what to think when I heard the words 'God has lost faith in humanity' but judging from the preview, I had to see this movie.

I wasnt at all disappointed with this movie. Everything about it is amazing!

So the storyline, as you should already know, God has lost faith in humanity and now comes the extermination. God is sending his Angels down to kill of humanity. One angel, or should I say Archangel, is not going to stand for it. Archangel Michael, as well as a group of strangers stand together to fight and to protect humanities only chance of survival, and unborn child. Now how can any of us resist a story like that. If you've read the book of reveltaions, actually even if you havent read it, you know it contains things we cant even dream of. Legion portrays this very well. Getting down every last detail, down to the swarm of bugs. I rate the storyline a 9/10, only because I am christian and I my belief is that God will never lose faith in humanity.

The acting was great as well. There is a lot of foul language in this movie, but if I were them I would be using those words to. All the actors played their parts amazingly. Paul Bettany, who played Archangel Michael, did a spectacular job and Tyrese Gibson brought a little comedy to the table as well. Just the way he says F*** makes you laugh.

The effects where really nothing to gloat about because I have seen better, but then again, they were simple effects, nothing big like Clash of the Titans or 300 or Alice In Wonderland. In fact, I find it very suprising that it cost $56 million to make this movie. But, for what the effects were they were good.

Overall, I loved this movie. It had its creepy moments and it was full of action. What more can you ask for from a movie. I would deffinetly suggest going to rent it and if you liked it, buy it. It was worth the $20 I spent on it.
