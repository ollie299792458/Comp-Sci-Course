This movie relates very well to life in a high school with such prestige. This movie not only shows the tremendously strong weight of being from the "right" religion, but it also shows many other important things that come to be true of the upper class schools of the east coast. This movie contributes the importance of being a "legacy" of one of these schools and how much harder you have to work if you are not one. If you were really to attend one of these schools, you would notice that popularity and respect revolve around these so called "legacies." The social events in this movie are very similar to the real settings of these schools. The form of education is different, as well as the form of social interaction. You would not see the classes that are shown in this movie at any normal high school anywhere in the United States. This movie really demonstrates life in one of these upper class schools. I could go on forever about how good this movie is as far as being correct but there is more than that. The director managed to portray this image and have an incredible cast as well. If you are looking for great acting/actors, then obviously this movie has it. If you are looking for this movie to maybe show in a classroom then go ahead. This movie will not steer you wrong in any way at all. This movie has it all!
