I can't believe that so many people find this movie even slightly interesting. Ella Enchanted is a horrid piece of work as far as film making goes. The acting is one of the worst, next to B-movie quality. The actors sound like they didn't memorize the script and have to read it to us on camera instead. Their performances are phoned in as well, looking awkward and stiff. The timing and delivery of dialog sounds weird and not the way people actually speak. The special effects or CGI shots are third rate as well, I've seen television commercials with better special effects than the ones seen here.

The set designs and set lighting effects look low budget and fake, almost like cardboard quality to it. The cardboard quality look of the sets reminds me of real live plays of I've seen in person, which is okay for a play but unacceptable for a film. There are much better fantasy films than this one. Ella Enchanted is not worth your time or money!

If you want to see other family fantasy movies I recommend: Princess Bride, Willow, Shrek, Enchanted (not to be confused with "Ella Enchanted")
