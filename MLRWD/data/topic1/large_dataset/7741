My husband and I had wanted to see this film in the theater, but, sadly, it was not given a real chance by the major theaters in our area, and we missed the opportunity. We now own the DVD, have watched the movie multiple times, and I have to say that "Bella" is one of the best films I have ever seen! It is a breath of fresh air in today's society - one which is plagued with overwhelming use of sex, extreme violence, gore, and profanity filling our choices on the big screen. This film has NONE of that - and for that, they deserve the highest praise!

If you really want to have the best experience of this film, I suggest that you do not read the reviews which give away most of the story. Although difficult, I have tried not to tell family and friends what the movie is about in any detail, and that is because of my own experience viewing it for the first time with no pre-conceived notions. It is powerfully moving - particularly in the places where the story turns in unexpected directions. Let yourself be "surprised" - you will not be sorry, and you will be greatly uplifted when the film has reached its conclusion.

What I WILL tell you is that this film is a great celebration of our God-given gift of life. After watching this film, many will have to give new consideration to the choices that they will make in their own lives. It explores an "angle" that may not seem popular in our present culture, but is certainly worthy of our consideration.

"Bella" is a MASTERPIECE, and no one over the age of 13 should be deprived of the opportunity to experience its message!
