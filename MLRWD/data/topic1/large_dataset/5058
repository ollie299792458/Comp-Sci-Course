This should be a cult-type film along the lines of Valley Of The Dolls and Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space. It's in the so-bad-it's-good category. How this script actually made it to the soundstage has to be one of the great unsolved mysteries of 1957, and probably a lot more interesting mystery than this ridiculous movie. We have Barbara Stanwyk, a 50-ish spinster who writes for a second-rate San Francisco newspaper and has no use for home & hearth & the pitter patter of tiny feet. The unspoken 1950s implication here is that the hard-bitten menopausal Stanwyk character is a "twilight girl." She meets up with a bland L.A. detective played by Sterling Hayden, a handsome joe who's easily 10 years her junior and probably fighting off hordes of police groupies. Displaying absolutely no chemistry, this unlikely couple get married out of nowhere and Stanwyk packs it in for a "stifling" life as an Eisenhower-era housewife in a nondescript neighborhood in an L.A. suburb. Choking on the suburban blandness and her hubby's lack of ambition, Stanwyk embarks on evil, homicidal schemes to move her lug up the LAPD ladder!! It's like Lucy Ricardo scheming to get into Ricky's floor show, only Stanwyk is a flat-out nut case. (Couldn't she just withhold marital favors until hub took a motivational course?) Your jaw will hit the floor with a restounding THUD as you watch Stanwyk cook up her plots against police wives and shacks up with LAPD brass, including Raymond Burr who thankfully had Perry Mason waiting in the wings after this turkey. The very thought of Raymond Burr & Barbara Stanwyk in the sack should put you off your lunch & dinner. (Thankfully it's off screen. Whew.) This is a LONG way from Double Indemnity . . . but pretty solid entertainment for those of you with a perverse sense of humor.
