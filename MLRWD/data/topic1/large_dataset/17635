Thomas Crown, the film's protagonist suffers from an illness common to the idle rich: terminal boredom.  Though he's not completely idle--as a currency trader he does seem to come to work, at least occasionally.  Still, he runs his firm effortlessly--giving the appearance that he could give orders to his underlings in his sleep.  So what to do?  Start a foundation to help the world's poor?  Fight racism (this was 1968, after all!)?  Nope!  Recruit and pay anonymous thugs to rob a bank and endanger civilians with potential gun play--and then have a laugh by yourself in your mansion after the caper has been successfully pulled off!

Luckily for Mr. Crown, and Steve McQueen who plays him, fate is about to send him a playmate to help beguile the intolerable tedium that is his life.  A freelance insurance investigator played by Faye Dunaway (the hot babe actress of that era) takes the job of tracking down the mastermind who had the nerve to mess with the banks.  She attends a polo match in which he is playing.  She speaks to him at a charity auction, making it clear to him that she is in hot pursuit.  A chess game at his mansion leads to a romantic relationship between the two.  So will she spring the trap that sends him to the clink--or will she run off with him to Rio or whatever and see what boring things the locals are up to?  Suffice it to the say that whatever the two choose, they will do it with style and grace.
