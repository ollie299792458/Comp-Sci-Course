This movie seemed to have some potential for science fiction, but got lost somewhere with all the subplots that had really nothing to do with what was really going on.  The worst part was how the Earth was saved...The whole thing was a mistake...A math error made by our hero.  I thought about it and decided that the hero was actually responsible for millions of deaths.  If his math had been right, then maybe world governments could have built shelters or somethings instead of just trying to keep things quiet.  Of course, since it was the hero the writers just skipped over his mistake hurting anyone and everyone just made happy that it was only a mistake in addition.  Huh?  Also, there is the issue of Emma Samms.  When casting someone as a hard boiled maverick reporter, the first name that comes to mind is not Emma Samms.  In fact on that list of potential actors or actresses to play a hard-boiled maverick reporter, Emma is probably not in the top thousand.  That said, she did play the part sincerely if not convincingly.  Perhaps too this is one of those rare films that would be better with the commercials.  Definately a broadcast TV event.  I really can't think of any reason to watch it though.
