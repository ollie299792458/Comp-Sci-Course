This is an amazing film that gets better every time I see it.  The first time I saw it was in Spain, without English subtitles.  I figured I had probably missed a significant part of the movie because my spanish is far from perfect, so I rented it as soon as I got back home to America.  I've seen it again, and again, and it never gets old.  The reason might be that the concept is so original.  Beware all people who like only like safe, conventional American movies, this film is not for you.  It's plot centers around homosexuals, transvestites, a pregnant nun, a drug-addicted actress, and just about anyone you might expect to see on Jerry Springer.  Any one without a VERY open mind might be frightened, worried, "weirded out" etc. by this movie.  Nevertheless, despite it's odd cast of characters the movie is really about concepts that are universal.  Funny, shocking, dramatic, disturbing, powerful, this movie hits all the bases.  You'll want to read Bodas de Sangre (Blood Weddings), a Street Car Named Desire, and watch All About Eve, just to get more of of thisspectacular movie.  Almodovar is a genius, the cinematography is great, the plot amazing, what can I say, I love this movie.
