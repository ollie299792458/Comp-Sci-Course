Man awesome set of shows from the second season of MASH.  The funniest episodes from the season is Carry On Hawkeye, and Dr. Pierce and Mr. Hyde.  Greatest episodes of all time because of the fact that it makes me laugh and cry unfortunatly because of the fact that Hawk is very funny and it makes me laugh and cry.  Some of the parts in the episode are great one of them is when Hawk goes into Henry's office and asks Radar to write a wire to the chief of the United States Army Harry Truman to ask him who done it and why.  Overall great set of 24 episodes from season 2 and can not wait for season 3 to come out.  From the looks of what Fox is doing we can expect Seasons 3, 4, and 5 to come out this year and next year Seasons 6, 7, and 8 to come out and after that the last three seasons to come out being 9, 10, and 11 and hoping 11 is a special four disc set.  Because of the fact that the series finale of MASH was a 2 1/2 hour episode entitled Goodbye, Farwell, and Amen.  I have taped the final episode from a marathon that I saw about three months ago.  But hoping fox does the smart thing and sends all the episodes on to a DVD.
