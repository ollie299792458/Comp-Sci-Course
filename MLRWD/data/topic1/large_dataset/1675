Be warned...contrary to the text in the graphic of the packaging above, this is NOT a re-issue of the 30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition. It only has 1 disc (not the 3 in the 30th Anniversary Edition). The disc is actually labled 'Disc 1' and it looks like they simply inlcluded Disk 1 of the previous versions.

The disc does contain all three versions of the movie (Orginal, Directors and Extended cut) and you can watch it an option where it will display text to tell you the differences in each version, but that's it. None of the other special features, extras and documentaries are included from previous versions. Hopefully, Amazon will update the image/packaging photo. Reading the cuatomer reviews was not helpful either as they all referred to prior 'Ultimate/Anniversary' and other previous editions, as no one had yet reviewed this new 'Blu Ray Eseentials' re-release (a version which is oddly not available at the other major retailers like Target, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, etc.)

There are no formal reviews of this 're-issue' out yet and the few sites where I did find any information, they were all completely wrong as it had the same incorrect packaging/slipcase image and said it included all the special features from the previous versions.

If you don't already own a previous Blu-Ray version and all you want are the three versions of the movie on one Blu-Ray disc, then this version maybe for you, but you can spend $5.00 less (at of 3/11/11) and get the 3-Disk 30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition, with all the Special Features included. I sent this one back and I will be buying the Ultimate Edition and save 5 bucks.

This is one of my favorite movies of all time and watching it now still sends chills up my spine, just like it did when I saw it orignally in the movie theater when I was 10 years old. You need this movie in your collection, regardless, but do not buy this overpriced bare-bones edition.
