Some "classic" movies become such icons that everyone knows they've seen them but never watches them again because "everybody's seen that already." If "High Noon" is that kind of film for you OR if you've never managed to see it because everybody AROUND you has that impression, here is a great way to reaquaint yourself with a classic that is not only a barrier-breaking western, it's also a film classic regardless of genre and worthy of the term.

Aside from the story of duty and how Gary Cooper's lawman feels obligated to stand up to the criminal who's coming to gun him down on the noon train (hence the title) the whole subtext of standing against prevailing opinion, germane in the McCarthy-ite 50's when this film was made, makes overall impressions beyond the plot itself. The vision of beauty that is the young Grace Kelly as his new Quaker/pacifist wife only adds to the enjoyment as do performances by supporting players like Lloyd Bridges and Katy Jurado and the later-to-be-made-famous-by-Spaghetti-westerns Lee Van Cleef as one of the badguy's henchmen.

This restored and picture perfect edition also includes a short but interesting documentary on the making of the film hosted by movie historain Leonard Maltin that interviews most of the people involved in the film, and a SECOND little special feature talks with the surviving children of Cooper, Kelly, the director, producer, and other principal participants, including the late John Riter, son of singing cowboy star Tex Ritter who made a hit of the theme song---and WOW does GARY COOPER's daughter look, talk, and even move like him!

Another interesting point made by the documentaries--"High Noon" was perhaps the first film ever made to use the technique of "real time"--it is almost exactly in synch with the actual minutes clicking down towards Noon and the many clocks in the film used to heighten the suspense are all in synch with each other--kind of a 1950's Western version of the modern TV hit "24" and unique for its time that way.

"High Noon" is considered to be one of the greatest movies and westerns ever made for a reason. In case you forgot, or never knew, why, this version is the one to get and, I'm sure, watch over and over through the years.
