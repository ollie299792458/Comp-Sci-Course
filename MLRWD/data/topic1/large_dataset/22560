Before I saw "JFK" I knew what, basically, everyone knows about the timeless president. I knew he was a great leader, and a good president, and that his death was a shock to the world [which illustrated how popular he was]. So, being only 15 when I first saw this film, you can forgive me for being a little ignorant about the growing resistance to JFK the President.
After watching this movie, my world changed. Oliver Stone presents the picture in a way that is so easy to understand, and he gives us all the facts, and makes the conspiracy theory easy-enough to follow. This movie will make you question everything - do the CIA and FBI have a hold over the President of the biggest countries in the world? If the said President stands up for his own beliefs, is he in danger of his very life? "JFK" tells us the answer is "yes", and shows how other Presidents will be merely puppets when forces like the Secret Service are in existence.
After watching this movie about 100 times, I can honestly say that I am never bored. It still leaves you with an ominous feeling of helplesness, and sorrow - but also makes you feel that you have been "let in" to the secret that has plauged the world since the 1960os. The actors are amazing - it is Kevin Costner in his best role [although he was, too, excellent in the 2001 film, "Thirteen Days"]. He can keep the viewer going for 3 hours of film, without growing tired, which is excellent. With excellent performances from Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones and a cameo from Walter Mattheu, "JFK" will open and broaden your mind and outlook, and allow you to see oscar-winning acting: a *fantastic* movie all around!
