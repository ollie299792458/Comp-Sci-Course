Having seen HOLIDAY INN at least a dozen times, I realized that I'd

never seen its reworked version, WHITE Christmas until it showed up on

TCM the other day. Aside from some great musical numbers (esp. the

dance sequences) this was an overlong snore. The plot was so convoluted

for such little payoff -- all that secrecy/misunderstanding for the

General's surprise party. And nothing says "Christmas cheer and warmth"

better than a stage recreation of a bombed-out European landscape! By

contrast, HOLIDAY INN, had a nicely paced inherent structure in its

telling of an inn open only on holidays and some truly memorable tunes

and musical numbers. That film's atmosphere and warmth seemed genuine

and not wrapped up in the false sentimentality and schmaltz of the

remake. The only reason to buy a DVD of WHITE Christmas would be to

have the ability to skip to the dance scenes.
