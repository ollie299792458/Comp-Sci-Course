I loved George C. Scott's version of Scrooge. I grew up with the 1938 version, and I still like it, but I like this one better.

Usually, the depiction of Scrooge is as a feisty, mean, old man, one who can intimidate and scare people as he comes there way. Scott portrayed him as a cold businessman, an Ebeneezer Scrooge that was more business than he was hot-tempered and mean. His coldness of heart evenutally transforms, but the change is believable. Scrooge still has the same temperment, but he is a much more compasionate man.

I also liked Jacob Marley's ghost. This Jacob Marley truly is a ghost you can believe has been cast into the depths of hell. His ghost was deeply tormented and had much remorse and regret for the selfish life he lived of hoarding money for selfish ain and greed. A great performance that deserves recognition. The 1938 version of Jacob Marley cannot compare.

The other characters were portrayed well, too....Bob Cratchit, his wife and children,especially Tiny Tim, the other ghosts, etc.
