I'm so in love with young Marlon Brando; I just I can't stand it! Every time I watch him, I'm simply overwhelmed by his unbelievable greatness. All I can do is touch the TV screen - he's gone forever! It's like a needy void that can't be filled! Why why why was'nt I born 50 years ago when this incredible, great-looking simply amazing "human being" was walking the Earth? (I put -human being- in quotaton marks because I truly believe he's really some kind of god) Sigh... Just my luck, I guess. Anyways
 This is a really good film. Not great, but almost. I personally believe ofcourse Brando steals the entire show and then some, but the rest of the cast is really entertaining. !!YES HE CAN SING YOU IDIOT NAYSAYERS!! The only thing that really annoyed me was the music; I'm very open-minded to musicals when the songs are catchy and slickly performed. Here they sing too many bland ballads at awkward moments for my taste: at the least expected moments they just start cooing and you wonder where that music is coming from! But only here does it get dangerously close to being another corny musical,otherwise this movie always bounces back with its fun story, settings, cool dialogue and characters and ofcourse, Brando. Ofcourse.
