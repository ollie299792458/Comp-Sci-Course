In the tradition of morality tales and fables, this movie is a great story about doing the right thing.
The movie is a mixture of Bollywood and Hollywood; it is the story of a woman from India who has
located herself in San Francisco.  She uses spices to assist people to realize their hopes, dreams, and
desires.  In this movie, the spices themselves are another character in this movie.  When Dylan
McDermott's character gets hurt, the mistress of spices must choose beyond what she has always known.
The love story is cute, but secondary to the lessons imparted by the spices.  This is a great movie
for women from traditional backgrounds to have illustrated for them the sorrows AND joys of moving
beyond traditions; not forsaking traditions but enlarging the paradigm in which traditions exist.
Both old and new ideas have value, and as human beings women must learn how to mix the old and the
new in a balanced way that allows growth without sacrificing the foundations of one's life.
I think this is a positive fable that empowers women without belittling men.  I loved this movie.
