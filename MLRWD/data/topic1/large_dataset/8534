May I agree to disagree with the editorial review and the Maltin review?
Okay then.
I have always found "Pete's Dragon" to be an engaging family film. Though it pales in comparison to Disney's last musical effort, "Bedknobs and Broomsticks," it scores points with an entertaining song score (anchored by the Oscar-nominated "Candle on the Water") and some delightful voice work by Charlie Callas as the voice of Elliott the Dragon. Mickey Rooney, Red Buttons, Jim Dale, Helen Reddy (in all fairness to negative reviews about her performance, the role of Nora is pretty lightweight to begin with) and Shelley Winters make an endearing ensemble. Of course, it is Elliott who is the film's greatest delight.
This DVD has excellent picture and sound quality. The colors are sharp and grain is minimal (save for the process shots that mix the animated dragon with the live-action scenes), and the sound is pretty clear. The supplements include a re-issue trailer from 1984, pieces with background information on the myth of dragons and other such creatures, and more. Disney has given this film the proper DVD treatment the first time around; all I'd do differently was attempt to restore the film to its original length of 135 minutes.
