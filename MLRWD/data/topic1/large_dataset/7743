This is a wonderful send-up of Society (stick your nose up when you say that word) that made audiences howl with delight in the heart of the Depression (and still does today). William Powell, Harvard grad, is found in a run-down Hooverville, totally down on his luck, by Carole Lombard and her sister Gail Patrick, the object of a scavenger hunt by them and their rich friends. He's offended, naturally, and scares Patrick away, but Lombard is intrigued and talks him into coming back with her so she can win the scavenger hunt. He does, but lets all the stuck-ups know exactly what he thinks of them. Lombard, still intrigued, hires him as the family butler. And what a family! Crazy as loons, the whole bunch. Powell, of course, takes charge and straightens everyone out; he even helps out the people back at the shantytown by getting a night club built (credulity is stretched just a bit too far by this point in the picture). Wedding bells are in the future for Lombard and Powell, and, of course, the fact that Powell was a Harvard man and came from a "good" family makes it okay for Lombard to marry him. (You can make of that what you will.)

It's a classic screwball comedy, with everything turned on its head, especially the idea that it's the "forgotten man" (Powell) who has all the common sense and dignity while the well-heeled are the knuckleheads and scamps. The hoi polloi trump the filthy rich once again, though the picture shows unneeded restraint when putting it to the wealthy. Lombard shows again why she was one of our great comic actresses, and Powell is cool and collected all the way. Despite the mellow approach where it could have been scathing, the movie is delightful in many ways. And B&W is still the best way to see it. Definitely worth a watch.
