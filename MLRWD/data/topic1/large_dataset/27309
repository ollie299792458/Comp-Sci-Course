Bach's first Cello Suite in G wafts through the scenes, and it really captures the meandering nature of the two characters. What is so ingenuous about this film is that here are two characters who seemingly walk different, divergent paths of life, yet are falling headlong in the same direction. The entire film can be seen as an aftermath of a terrible tragedy and how it affects people for the rest of their lives, but under Londergan's sure direction, the message never becomes trite, watered down soundbites of Freudian pathology. The performances are unilaterally wonderful, and Ruffalo especially is powerful as a smoked-out brother who cannot, and stubbornly will not find his place in the world. The sadness between the pauses is poignant, but the hope of the last couple sequences are spine-tingling. The film, by the way, takes the top prize for using the title as a meaningful part of the story, as it is the "punchline" that is left unsaid at the end of the film, the remembered pact between the brother and sister who love each other now as they have back then. Remarkable.
