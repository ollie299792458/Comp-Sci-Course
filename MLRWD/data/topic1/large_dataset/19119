One of the customer reviewers said she loved this movie but wasn't sure if men would enjoy it. The answer is a resounding YES! My wife and I went to  see RETURN TO ME with another couple and, believe me, we husbands enjoyed  this film every bit as much as our wives. The labeling of movies (womens'  films, chick flicks,  guy movies, etc) is ridiculous - a good movie is a  good movie. Women aren't supposed to like a picture like GLADIATOR or THE  PATRIOT but my wife loved both as do most of the women I know who have seen  them. My dad and father-in-law both were crazy about TEA WITH MUSSOLINI  which was "considered" a woman's movie. And how many of us have  enjoyed films we would have missed the pleasure of seeing had we listened  to negative critical reaction from the press? So, if you want to see a  wonderful, heart-warming, touching and funny (especially Carroll O'Connor  and Robert Loggia who should be jointly nominated for a Best Supporting  Actor Oscar!)film the entire family can enjoy and actually RELATE to,  please buy RETURN TO ME because it will be the video you keep bringing out  to show to friends who haven't see it!
