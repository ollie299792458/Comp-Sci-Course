The Last Temptation of Christ is not quite a weird movie. If you're expecting profound blasphemy and other good stuff, this is actually tame like a punk that bought all their outfit at Hot Topic. For one thing, the movie dares show Jesus might have had a different mind than most people, one prone to breakdown that might lead him to imagine he's God. But there's not much point to showing this side since he is also shown performing every miracle. There's no dispute in the film to his superhuman status, which makes the fact that this film was so controversial very funny. Jesus comes across as kind of a spacey neurotic and more than a bit unprepared to be the magical son of God, but still it's faithful to Christianity in message. Much of his fear and doubt are just interpretation of the Bible and common sense take on the character.

I suppose the fact that there's a prostitute doing her job on several men while Jesus waits around to talk to her, is the big edginess to the film. Either that or that Judas is a bit of an expanded and different role. Yet why get offended over such things, they're hardly that shocking in the long run. It's unfortunate that to some degree I think this movie has to be defended against Christian maniacs, and rated a bit higher. Just the fact that they'll toss so many 1 ratings at it like the people stoning others in the movie, gives films like this on obvious need for appreciation. So give it a watch at least once. Oh and enjoy the Brooklyn Jew accents because they'll definitely make you bust a gut laughing a few times.
