Science-Fiction movies have to be entertaining and crowd-pleasing. "I, Robot" nails the crowd-pleaser with absolute precision. Every summer, Will Smith plays an unlikely hero (1995 "Bad Boys", 1996 "Independence Day", 1997 "Men In Black, 1998 "Enemy Of The State", 1999 "WilBad Boiysd Wild West", 2000 "Legend Of Bagger Vance", 2001 "Ali", 2002 "Men In Black II", 2003 "Bad Boys II"...) and he is either hit or miss. In "I, Robot," Will Smith smashed one out of the park. They're have been several Smith movies I have not enjoyed, but Will more than redeemed himself with "I, Robot".
And if your not a Will Smith, that's alright, because "I, Robot" has the most butt-kicking special effects you will see all year. With an original plot, and an even better ending, "I, Robot" is one of those flicks that you will always remember for its sheer presentation.
"I, Robot" may not be Academy Award friendly like "Titanic" or "Lord Of The Rings", but I assure you, you may not have as much fun watching a movie for a very long time, or at least until summer 2005...
