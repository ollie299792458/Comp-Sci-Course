Whoever selected the cast for this picture deserves an honor.  There are probably fifty other actors who could have played the confused yet convincing Cole, at least a hundred who could have played the part of the endearing, made psycho and at least a thousand who could have played the female psychiatrist.  But the selection of Willis, Pitt and Stowe was a stroke of genius.
It is difficult to imagine anyway EXCEPT Willis in the role with his befuddlement, drive and raw emotions.  And Stowe's slowly evolving awareness of something impossible to believe was a sight to behold.  But it was the dark story line that carried the movie.  This film is a mystery with a little science fiction thrown in for fun.  What makes it so alluring is the absence of blatant "here it is" storytelling.  Lots of inferences and off the screen suppositions. 
Several scenes stand out - the shot of the NY Library, the inquisition before the panel, the final, desperate lunge and sudden remembrance...the whole effect was chilling. A perfect film noire.
