The hot and dirty streets of Rio de Janeiro have never been so interesting.  The movie is a graphic look of what the city of god (which is looked within Rio de Janerio)was like through out the 60's.  From the grittiest depiction of violience to the jaw dropping story line.  It is one of those movie which embodies you for the total 130mins, but also will make one think.  The story line of the movie is unlike most other movie, it has a fell that some one who lived in the city of god just sat down and told you a story.  The movie develops very fast through many different characters, that all link together is some way.

When one watches this wonderful movie, they will laugh, cry and get goose bumps, but will still come out thinking.  It is a great movie just dont be fant of heart, because the graphic violetion and depiction of poverty is almost crippling, but informitve and inspiring.

(p.s. when u buy the dvd watch the documentary of rio de Janeiro it makes the movie look like childs play)
