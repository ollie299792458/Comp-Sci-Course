The 1930s were a great time for film. Sound was still relatively new, the first technicolor films came out. The new rules for cinema were being invented. San Francisco holds its own with other greats of the decade, Wuthering Heights, Gone with the Wind, etc. Clark Gable's Blackie is clearly a forerunner to Rhett Butler. He's cool under fire, has a darker side but tries to do right and is irresistable to women whether he's good for them or not. Blackie's seduction of Mary Blake is scintillating and rivals some of the great moments in cinema history.
While the characters, story and special effects are strong the location feels weak. Despite giving the location top billing as the title I never felt as though it was one of the most sinful cities in the world. Blackie's Barbary Coast is lacking any of the supposed menace that they speak of in the movie. The looting, street mobs and violent army clashes are completely glossed over in the post-earthquake scenes except for one token image of of a dead man with the sign "Shot for looting" hung around his neck.
