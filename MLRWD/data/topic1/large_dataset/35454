The five-star rating here refers to the original "Collectors Edition" DVD of  "The Mummy" that came out a while back; I'd rate the film itself 3 stars (light, but cool effects) but the disc itself was top-notch all the way.  So a note to DVD fans; the only difference between this version and the original "Collectors Edition" is a few added interviews and the inclusion of a DTS mix of the soundtrack. The picture transfer itself is exactly the same, which is saying a lot since it is reference quality. (Especially on a 16x9 display through component video inputs). If your sound/home theater system is equipped for it, check out the DTS mix - it is, in many respects, better than the Dolby Digital mix on the first disc (better channel separation and richer bass and vocal tones), but again, only if your system is set up for it will you notice any difference. If not, (and if you're not a die-hard fan of the film) there's no need to re-buy this one; however, if you've got the amps and the equipment, this one is a sure way to show off what a good home theater system can do - and blow away your friends at the same time! Pic's a huge amount of fun, though, either way you go...
