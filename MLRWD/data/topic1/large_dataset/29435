As a critical and analytical viewer of soap operas, I loved this movie.  At first I thought that in order to enjoy and understand most of the film you would need to be an avid fan of soaps.  This is simply not true.  While there are a lot of subthemes throughout the film that lend themselves to "soap opera"-ology (i.e. the recurring Hispanic telenovela theme and the pathos of the actors of A Reason to Love), the movie has much for the most rabid soap-opera hater.  
Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock, Renee Zellweger, and many of the supporting cast members do a fine job.  I was not a huge Chris Rock fan before seeing the movie, but it changed my opinion of him as an actor.  
The only reason this doesn't get five stars from me is that the language and nonseqiteur violence really catches you off guard.  However, those are key criteria to a dark comedy.
If you are a fan of soap operas, you will love this movie.  If you detest soap operas, you will equally love this movie.  If you like good, quirky, creative films, you will love this movie.
