"Beyond the Gates of Splendor" is a fantastic overview of the story of five missionaries who were killed while trying to make contact with a tribe of Indians in Ecuador who were basically living in the stone age, and who had very little, if any, prior contact with other peoples.  This was a tribe that was known for killing each other, to the point that most of them did not survive past the age of 30.  The story is not just about the death of the missionaries, however - it is a story of redemption and forgiveness, as the sister, wives, and son of some of the slain missionaries later go into the jungle and befriend the same people who had killed their loved ones.  If you don't believe that God is real and can change hearts, you need to hear this story and discover how God used the death of these men to reach the very ones who had speared them to death.  It's also a great DVD just for the purpose of learning about culture and way of life that is so alien to most of us.  I highly recommend "Beyond the Gates of Splendor."
