I give this DVD Re-issue two stars for its beautiful packaging in its embossed casing and the inner sleeves and booklets and photos that it comes with and also to the wider aspect ratio and clearer picture...but overall I am very disappointed in this.  First of all, the three-camera angle image is NOT completely erased...you can still see it when scenes change. It looks like it was airbrushed out and you can even notice a difference in the Technicolor print.  Second of all, the sound in not much better than the original one-disc version in 5.1 Surround and there is a slight pause or muting of the sound at the very end of the first two chapters, which is very noticeable. The best scoring of the film is at the beginning during the credits and should be more powerful, but it is not...it sounds different right from the beginning and a little distorted...Also the sticker on the outside of the shrink wrap says" over 4 hours of bonus feature content"..this is totally false..all it has is a documentary "Cinerama Adventure" on the third disc, which is 1 hour and 36 minutes...the rest is commentaries over the film and a theatrical trailer on the first disc.  They even had to chop this film in half and put it on two discs...it is only 2 hours and 44 minutes...give me a break! This completely ruins the continuity of the film. It could have fit intact on one complete disc, which would in turn kept the price down. If TITANIC fit on one disc and several other films, this should have too. If you have the original one-disc DVD, there is no need to upgrade to this, unless you care about photos, booklets and a re-packaging...even the original has a better anamorphic aspect ratio...look out Warner Bros...I hope when you decide to release RAINTREE COUNTY to DVD for the first time, you do it right.
