When I first saw this movie I was very much positivly surprised. It is a fantastic and very funny coupling of 9 storys.

Hugh Grant made an excellent job as PM. In his older films I did not like him that much, but this time he completly convinced me (and that "relationship" with the American President was droll - nobody can ignore, that there`s a little bit of thruth in the real relationship between the actual PM and the actual President...)

Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson (and his boy) did a great job as usually. The story of Colin Firth (a good actor too!) was as delighting as all the other small plots. The "star" Billy Mack is the ultimate comedian touch in the movie - very much better than Rowan Atkinson!

And last but not least Keira Knightley: she is so wonderful and beautiful in that movie (She was gorgeous in POTC, but in LA she`s even better). And I liked her storyline very much with this "triangular relationship".

And for some maybe angry Americans: The USA weren`t dissed that much. It was only a small joke that Billy Bob Thornton-thing (but only a guy like him, who does not like George W., could have played THIS president). The USA still are a great country - this movie didn`t change this and the country`s credit...And do not forget: For other nations it is quite normal to be the "bad guys" in lots of movies: the arabians, the germans, the japanese...
