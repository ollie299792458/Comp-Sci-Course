"Paradise Lost" is a documentary film that will permanently open viewers' eyes to the tragic miscarriages of justice that can occur in the American court system. Warning: Viewing this film may result in emotional discomfort and sleepless nights.
With more felony cases being reopened and overturned every day, often due to reexamination of physical evidence with DNA testing unavailable when the cases were first tried, false convictions are beginning to cause a stir in the public consciousness.
