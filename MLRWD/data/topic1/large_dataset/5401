There have been some comments in reviews around the net about the picture-postcard look of this film being a little hard to believe. But I can assure you, having lived in Japan during the years the film was made and released, that this is exactly what it looked like then. From the military scenes, the big city, religious shrines and parks, to the seedy canal village.

What's hard to believe of course, besides Brando's accent, is the almost magical ability of a boorish, and not so subtly chauvinistic character like Ace Gruver to, within a few days, bridge the immense cultural and societal gap between the "Ugly American" and the cloistered superstar Hana-Ogi, and in the first date get a commitment of eternal love from her! Still, the ethereal beauty and personality that Miiko Taka brings to the role makes this improbable love story just as believable as any star-crossed classic. It's a wonder that Taka didn't get nominated too.

One of my yardsticks for how classic a film really is relies on how impressed I was with it as a kid, and 50 years later finding out how good it still is, even after I now understand what it's really about, and how movies are really made.

Despite it's few silly drawbacks though, this is definitely a minimum two-hanky date flick for couples at any level of involvement.
