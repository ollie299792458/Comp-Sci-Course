Though I'm not as big a fan of her Vespertine material as her prior work, but this concert is nonetheless enjoyable!
The first half drags a bit with pretty much all songs being performed off the Vespertine (with the exception of "Overture" and the fabulous "All is Full of Love") album, but the second half picks up steam and really delivers a one-two punch!
"Possibly Maybe" is performed in a more electronica format with hints of tropical/Hawaiian sounds mixed in. Bjork really shines on "Human Behavior," a song which would normally be stale if it were attached to any other performer, however Bjorks adds in a strong mixture of electronic bleeps and buzzes as well as an orchestra that builds and builds until the end crescendos with strings and horns. For this song alone, it makes the DVD a must-own!
My only complaint is that I would love to have seen a few songs performed off of Selmasongs, her soundtrack to Dancer In The Dark. It is a near crime that "Scatterheart" and (the Oscar nominated) "I've Seen It All" are absent.
