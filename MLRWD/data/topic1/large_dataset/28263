I have been beefing up my DVD collection lately, trying to see some non samurai japanese flicks and this popped on as a recommendation. I bought it on a whim and now Kihachi Okamoto's SWORD OF DOOM is easily in my top ten favorite movies. Besides the subject matter of samurai which is usually just fun with swords, this movie has an amazing plot with many interesting layers and a little bit of insight into the turmoil that japan was going through when trying to end the Shogunate. A warning I would give is to be prepared for, with only one exeption I can think of, some very unsympathetic characters. For me it was one of he refreshing things about the movie was that the characters had naive,idealistic,selfish or sometiimes pyschopathic motivations. Very human and easy to understand but not to accept.

The performances are fantastic and the cinematography is so incredible that I often forgot it was 40 years old. if you area  fan of samurai movie or just looking for a new classic for your collection buy this movie.
