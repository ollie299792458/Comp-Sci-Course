The first episode left me wanting. Here was a series that screamed Gladiator meets 300 meets Caligula. It appeared as if the show was going to forgo a solid story in favor of winning the crowd with violence, sex, and action--as if the writers mistook their contemporary audience for the heathen one portrayed in the arenas. Yet what surprised me was that after watching a few more episodes of this series, I was absolutely hooked. There is a solid story here with numerous narrative arcs to keep you guessing and wanting more. The acting is strong and gets better with each episode.

The CGI is, for the most part, good. In the first Featurette, the team discusses their intention to convey the series using the tropes of a graphic novel. I think 300 far exceeds what was accomplished here, but Spartacus: Blood and Sand does a good job with what was probably a significantly smaller budget. It seemed like the the attempts to wow us with graphics were tempered after the first few episodes and the story itself rose to the top. Not coincidentally, this was also when I became more deeply involved with the series and enjoyed it much more.

Overall I think Spartacus: Blood and Sand is worth a watch. Definitely not for young children or those put off by graphic violence and sex.
