This is a great DVD!  I just received it about a month ago and use it 5 days a week.  I'm not new to pilates but am new to mat pilates and wanted the best technical training out there.  They truly follow the technique of Joseph Pilates.  I started with just 10 minutes a day and now am up to about 15-20.  This is not for people who want cardio or a calorie burning exercise (though you will eventually get that in intermediate/advanced), but is for people who want to do the classical technique in their home.  I also highly recommend buying the book, "Pilates: Bodies in Motion", by Alycea Ungaro.  It is so helpful with it's visuals and explanations.  I read it a couple times before I started the DVD so I could really comprehend the breathing and powerhouse technique.  It's become my handbook.  Someone else in these reviews suggested this book and I'm so glad they did because it's really helpful and you will also see Alycea in this DVD.  I want to add that I didn't find the voiceover (a slight accent) at all hard to understand.  He speaks slowly and thoroughly.  For those who think it moves too fast without waiting for the viewer, I suggest keeping the remote near you and pressing pause so you can complete each exercise in "your" time without rushing it.  I'm using the pause button less and less as I am getting more familiar with the program and more strength.  If you haven't figured it out yet, I HIGHLY recommend this DVD!!!!!!
