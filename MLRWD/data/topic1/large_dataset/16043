I love period dramas, and this movie is one of my favorites.  The costumes, as well as the locations where they shot this film are very accurate and well done.  The cast is exceptional, and the script is very well written.

Some of the scenes, with their rich dialog, blow me away, especially the scenes between Valmont (John Malkovich) and the Marquis (Glen Close). The characters in this movie are deep, complicated human beings.  John Malkovich and Glen Close give an outstanding performance.

My two favorite parts in this movie are the opening scene and the final scene.  In the opening scene, the Marquise de Merteuil (Glen Close) brushes her hair in the mirror and smiles to herself, as she sees her reflection.  The final scene is of the Marquise taking off her makeup and looking at her reflection in same mirror.  This time there are tears running down her face.  The Marquis tells Valmont that her desire is to "win or die," as she seaks personal revenge over a society that gave her no freedom as a woman in upper class 18th century France. If the opening scene is of the Marquis "winning", we can guess what this final scene is about.

This is a dramatic movie.  However, this film concludes with a brillent scene which quietly and tragically ends the story.  This final scene is subtle, and creates pity for a character who has been a villain through out the film.
