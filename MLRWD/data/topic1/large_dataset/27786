SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE is like a documentary of the making of the 1922 vampire classic NOSFERATU. and sure to be a classic its self. John Malkovich stars as the director F.W. Murnau, that wants to make the very best Vampire movie ever. And think's who would be better to play a vampire on film then a real vampire. So Murnau makes a deal with Max Schreck a real vampire played by (Willem Dafoe) That if Max plays the vampire Count Orlock in  Murnau's film NOSFERATU. that at the end of the film he can drink the blood of his female co-star. But no one else that are working on the film knows about the deal or that max schreck is a real vampire they are all just told that max schreck will always stay in character. They are all freaked out by Max Schreck but don't know anything is up until Max starts attacking and killing other members of the film cure and Murnau just keeps filming
SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE is a very good dark and spooky movie
and Willem Dafoe is great as the very spooky Max Schreck aka Count Orlock
