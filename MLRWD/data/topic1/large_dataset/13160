I have to agree with what another viewer wrote and say that what I believe made this such a scary film comes from our childhood fears. Watching this movie late at night and alone. I cannot tell you how wrapped up in the musical soundtract as well as the "dark" photography I got. It was incredible and some of the scenes are just sooooo well done. When the Harker character seeks out the coffin of the vampire and sees count Orlok peering out of a crack in the coffin it is positively freightening. Another incredible scene is later on the ship when a crew member goes below to destroy the count. He starts hacking at the cargo and out comes the rats after he busts a hole in the crate and straight as a pole rises count orlok out of his coffin. The counts rat like appearance, long finger nails and huntch back gives him a most gruesome look. He reminds me of the perverted lurker on a street corner who snatches children. As another viewer put it,he offers the audiance "dangerous candy" that is difficult to resist. It is the first film in years to give me nightmares. If you love classic films or are a true collector into the horror genre, get this film.
