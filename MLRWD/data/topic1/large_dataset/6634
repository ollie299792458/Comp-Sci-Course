Keanue Reeves? Matt Damon? Ben Afleck? Those pretty boys are the best action stars of the next generation? C'mon, these guys are more concerned with whether or not their clothes match than actually being the next Bruce Willis, Clint Eastwood, or Sly Stallone! Have I lost all hope in Hollywood's future action films? Well no, because I saw a little gleam of hope when I watched The Transporter.
Unlike most recent Hollywood action movies that use Martial Arts (The Matrix, The Bourne Identity, Daredevil) The Transporter brings something different to the table -- a star with authentic toughness. Jason Statham has style, a cool British wit, and the toughness to back it all up, something that OTHER "action" stars have been lacking. Although The Transporter may not be an overall better movie than recent action flicks, I would still gladly watch Statham beat the [pooh] out of a bunch of guys than watch Keanue Reeves do "Kung-Fu".
The DVD is of pretty good value. The DVD itself contains both Fullscreen and Widescreen versions (Widescreen is the better of the two) and three language tracks to choose from. The extras are all pretty good as well: a Behind-the-Scenes featurette, audio commentary by Statham, a threatrical trailer, and 15 minutes of uncut fight scenes with optional commentary. The fight scenes are the obvious draw here and they don't disappoint. I warn you however, that once you watch the uncut fight scenes, you may feel a little shortchanged with what was left in the actual movie.
Overall, The Transporter was a terrific movie, and it makes an even better DVD. You action fans who are tired of special effects, pretty boy action stars, and overdone camera angles rejoice! The Transporter has FINALLY arrived!
