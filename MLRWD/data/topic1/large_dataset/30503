As a couple who grew up with comic book heroes such as Superman and Batman on TV and later watched Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno on their weekly Hulk series, we enjoyed the new movie, The Incredible Hulk.  In comparing it to other movies of the superhero genre, we weren't blown away by it, but we had few complaints.  It was a fun stay-at-home date movie, and something we wanted to watch prior to seeing the new Avengers film.

For us, personally, we would have liked to have seen the plot begin earlier in the Hulk's history -- to see how he became the Hulk.  The beginning credits do a fairly good job of catching the viewer up by showing newspaper headlines and short video clips that depict that story in brief, so someone who had really never seen a Hulk story before wouldn't be totally lost.  I think we're just used to the "typical" superhero movie spending more time on the creation story of each main character.  I could appreciate by the end of the film why the producers chose not to spend unnecessary time on that aspect -- so this particular episode could bring us farther along in the story without making the film unbearably long.  I guess it just felt more like a sequel to us.  If you watch it with that idea in mind, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

The story line, acting, and special effects were all good.  Again, we really had no complaints.  Of course, it's not 100% believable, but I think that's to be expected with this type of film.  One watches a superhero movie to be entertained, not educated, and to see good triumph over evil.  The Incredible Hulk did not disappoint in any aspect of that formula.  I'd say it was a "worth seeing" movie, but not necessarily a "must see" one.
