I loved the remake of Footloose. I was a fan of the original, and think this movie stayed true to the first, and added so much to it.

Kenny Wormald does a fantastic job as Ren- boy can act, move, is hot,and has chemistry with the whole cast. Julianne Hough does a great job as Ariel.
She has really impressed me with her acting, and can dance so well. Miles Teller as Willard.. WOW. I'd never seen him in anything before, but
he's so funny. As good as Kenny, and Julianne are in this (and they are good), Miles has some great scene stealing moments. His girlfriend, Rusty, is
also fantastic. I'm not sure of the actress, but she's beautiful, and can dance. Andie McDowell is fantastic as Ariel's mom, Vi. She has a understated
strength. Dennis Quaid does a good job as the concerned father of Ariel, and the town reverend. There are several fantastic scenes where Ren and the Reverend
talk- my favorite being towards the end when he asks for permission to take Ariel to the dance. And of course Ren's speech at the town council is excellent.
And watching Willard learn to dance was HILARIOUS. And the little girls (Ren's cousins) are pure cute. Fantastic supporting cast. Amazing stars.

Highly recommend this movie.
