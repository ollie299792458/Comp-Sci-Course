I've seen the words stupid and cheezey to describe this alot.  I would add Kitchy and Hammy to those adjectives and then wonder why it is so many people (critics especially) watched this literally rather than as a farce, where the cheese, the ham, the kitch and the stupidity are there for a purpose.  Where have I seen a nymph in a school girl outfit wielding a weapon she couldn't possibly deal with to massive plaudits?  Oh yeah, Kill Bill.  Now that was stupid.  This was making fun of it in a hokey way. This was written in the same vain as say an Austin Powers.

The only thing that is serious in the film is the relationship and as generic as romantic-comedies have become, this should be given high praise for the cute, somewhat silly, believable romance. The fact that it is two women is better still because typically lesbians in film are a) background noise in a straight movie or b) the focus of a lesbian themed movie that ends up depressing the hell out of you (if these walls2, monster, lost & delirious).  And I just loved the matter-of-factness about their sexuality. Sure their relationship is questionable but not because Amy is questioning her sexuality, but because she has issues with Lucy's career:)

And on top of that, as a guy myself, I liked that the men were not utter douches.  The ex is needy, but not unlike a lot of guys I have seen after a breakup. But he's not bad.  And Scud was a great character, although he definitely was channeling some Ryan Reynolds.

So give it a shot.  Just don't take it seriously.
