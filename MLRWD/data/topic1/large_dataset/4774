I loved every minute of this film and plan to see it again.  The movie is not only a wonderful portrait of Cairo and its people, it touches on the contrasts of US and Egyptian culture. There is a light romance, the kind you know can never be.

First, there is the visual beauty of Cairo. In the print I saw the the color was not great, but this did not diminish the beauty of the city or the people. The street scenes, Tareq's coffee house, the Corniche, Khan el-Khalili, the Nile, Ramses Station, the traffic, the desert, the mosque, the wedding etc. were all true to my experience of Egypt.

Then there is the beauty of the people. When Juliette asks why no one has asked her to leave the men only coffee house, Tareq says "It would be rude". When she says the men are following her his friend says "You are a beautiful woman."  This courtesy and easy grace characterized the Egyptian people I knew. The people in national dress from many parts of Africa, the many styles of hijab and galabaya reflected the diversity and spirit of Cairo. It reminds you that Egypt has been a melting pot since long before the US was even conceived.

Then there was the contrast of culture. Julliette can not imagine possible dangers for her regarding the letter she has delivered. She is surprised at the reactions to her daughter's degree and her son's elopement. Tareq accepts that the girls in the carpet schools are saving for their weddings and Julliette sees exploitation. When Juliette's husband finally arrives he looks scruffy and overly casual compared to the immaculate and formal Tareq.

My only criticism is about Juliette's wardrobe. The low necklines of the gown and the bathrobe don't fit the style of the film. Juliette was an intelligent woman. After a day in Cairo, why would she wear such a sheer skirt to a mosque?

If you love Cairo and the Egyptian people, you will love especially love this movie.
