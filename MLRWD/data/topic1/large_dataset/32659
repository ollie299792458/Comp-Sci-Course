Another Blockbuster 5 for $20 video that was too good of a deal to pass up.  Mel Gibson has (to my recollection) never dissappointed me with a movie that at least didn't hold my interest.  So for 4 bucks I had to give it a shot.  I can't say I wasted my money, but it's not the best 2 hours I have ever spent either.

The plot was very contrived in my opinion, with the political, social, and corporate corruption.  It has all of the elements of the Bourne trilogy, but it's just not as fun or as believable.  Political coverups (I am sure) happen, but the one in this movie really stretch believability, even in a movie.

And that isn't my real problem.  Plot is important, but if I am to be able to follow the plot, I have to understand (and hear) the dialogue.  (I have a great sound system, so it was not the problem).  So many times I had to rewind and ask my wife, "What did he say?"  And it wasn't just because Ray of Winestone's heavy accent, Mel Gibson's speech was often mumbled and muted in my opinion .  (Note:  Ray Winestone is an awesome actor, but English subtitles on in whatever movie he is in is suggested for us California folks).

Some surprising moments and some good action sequences did keep it at least interesting enough to keep it on.  So I recommend this for Mel Gibson fans only (with subtitles on).
