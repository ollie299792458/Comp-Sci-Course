I purchased this film about three of weeks ago.  I didn't bother to read the reviews left by others mainly because I rarely get anything out of them and agree with very few of them.  I am a supernatural/horror/dark fantasy fan who has become extremely difficult to please.  I suppose it has a lot to do with the quality or lack thereof, that has become the norm in today's film industry .  Since the dawn of the new millennium the biggest theatrical blockbusters are basically extended versions of Saturday morning cartoons - Go figure.
So this morning I decided to forgo the usual Paranormal/UFOlogical/Cryptozoological documentaries in favor of this horror film - And I, as so many others were, blown away with "The Burrowers".  Honestly, I can count the horror films that have impressed me in the past 10 yrs ON ONE HAND.  Without going into the, What's When's, Why's, and How's, I will just say that "The Burrowers" is a film that cannot be missed by any fan of this genre' - It had the quality of an H.P. Lovecraft story, with a touch of John Carpenter.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  Buy it or rent it but DO NOT MISS IT~!
