I guess you're all wondering, "What's this gal doing?  Here it is June and all she can rate are Christmas films."  And I know I said you couldn't go through Christmas without White Christmas and Miracle on 34th  Street, but here's another one for you.  It's a Wonderful Life is a  wonderful classic about what life would be like if you were never born.  Now I know everybody out there probably wishes at one time or another that  they'd never been born.  "Why, if I'd never been born, I wouldn't be  going through all this heartache and pain."  Heartache and pain, or  not, life is always worth living.  If you were never born, what would have  happened to your mom and dad, your brothers and sisters, your husband or  wife.  You would never have had the wonderful children that you hold so  dear.  Maybe you did something in your life that saved the life of someone  precious to you.  If you'd never been born, you could not have done  that.
If George Bailey had never been born, his little brother Harry  would have died when he broke through the ice when he was a child.  He  would not have grown up to save his entire regimen from the enemy during  World War II.
If George Bailey were never born, his mother would have had  to start a boarding house just to make ends meet.
If George Bailey were  never born, his wife Mary would have become an old maid, afraid of her own  shadow and ever shy.
If George Bailey were never born, he would never  have had his beautiful children, and there would have been no petals from  his youngest daughter, Zuzu.
If George Bailey were never born, there  would have been no Clarence the angel to come to Earth to show George just  how much he was needed.  The entire town relied on George.  If George had  not been around, the whole town would have gone to old man Potter and it  would not have been the nice little town it was with George.
So you see,  no matter how bad your life is, it would be worse if you'd never been born.
