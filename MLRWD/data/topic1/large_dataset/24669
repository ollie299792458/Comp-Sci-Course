I haven't seen anyone mention that they put the original score back into the English dubbed version. They had Jo Hisashi create a new score for the previous version (for what reason I can't comprehend? Imagine if someone did that for Star Wars?). It was one of the biggest crimes in the history of cinema as far as I'm concerned. It completely changed the effect of the opening sequence especially. That opening scene I feel is one of the great movie openings of all time. I actually bought the Region 2 version that had the original dub that Streamline Pictures did in 1989. I was fortunate enough to see it on the big screen 3 times during it's two week run. I still think it's a better dub than the Disney one. A shame about the DubTitles though, the original Disney release is better for the subbed version. Hard to believe the inconsistent attention to detail in DVD releases. Anyway, still one of the greatest anime titles of all time. Miyazaki is the only writer/director I've come across who hasn't put out a clunker in over 30 years! Starting with his "Conan, Boy of The Future" TV series in 1978. Still mindblowing it's never been released state side, except for Spanish TV many moons ago.
