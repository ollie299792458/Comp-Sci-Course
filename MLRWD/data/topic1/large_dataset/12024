I have all of Jari Love's workout videos. She is awesome and truly wants to help you achieve your goals. Most of her stuff focuses on lifting weights, or lifting your own body weight while holding weights.  Her Get Ripped 1000(red outfit on the cover) was where she added cardio to her workouts. That is a great video. Then she did the first Extremely Ripped 1000 (green outfit on cover), which is a series of weights and hi intensity intervals made to work everything. That one is a calorie burner for sure...love it and probably my favorite of all my videos.
This video (Body Rock) I think is her answer to the current popularity of "dance workouts".  She has a separate "trainer" doing small interval dance moves swtiching off to her and her team doing the cardio invtervals. Then the last 1/2 is weights and floor work.  I think the dance part is ok...i enjoy it for the laugh (at myself), but i don't really feel like i am getting a work out doing that section.  The cardio and weight sections are what make me sweat.  It does have a nice variety and the time passes quickly.  It's a nice break from the hard core calorie burning videos - but i think if you are advanced, you might want to go with the EXTREMELY RIPPED 1000 (green and yellow cover) and don't do any modifiers. Thank you Jari, you ROCK.
