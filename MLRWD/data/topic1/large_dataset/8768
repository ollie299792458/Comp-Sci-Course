Imagine being trapped in some sort of fantasy world where you keep dying horrible deaths over and over and over, and can't escape or figure out why. Pretty creepy, huh? Well thats the premise of this particular outing from 2007's Eight Films to Die For.

For those not in the know, its an annual limited run of indie horror movies by After Dark Films, and they tend to be quite original. While I wasn't able to make it to any of 2007's movies in the theatre, I have been steadily collecting them on DVD. So far, I've liked what I've seen. The first series of movies was incredible, but last years managed to out-do even those, so I must give my hats off to all involved. Great job!

Now, as for this particular movie, it is set in Britain and follows the numerous deaths of one Mr. Ian Stone, who keeps getting killed by a supernatural force for some reason he can't remember. As his memories start coming back, we learn that he is trapped by... some sort of interdimensional beings.... demons, ghosts, whatever you want to call them. I don't want to go into too much depth, since it'd spoil the surprise. But the movie was very well done, though the ending was quite an abrupt change of pace. If you want spoilers, check out some of the other reviews. If you want to be surprised, go buy the DVD.

As with the other 8 Films to Die For, we are given some bonus serials of the 2007 'Miss Horrorfest Contest,' which features a bunch of dark Gothic chicks fighting it out for their place as queen of the horror movie crowd. Quite good stuff actually, but not with all that much relevence to the movie I fear.

All in all, it was quite a good outing, and I enjoyed it. But then, I'm also a big horror movie fan, so I might be a little biased here. Anyway, I'm going to continue my way through the rest of the 2007 set, steadily making my way up to Frontiers (which I VERY eagerly await). So far, so good!
