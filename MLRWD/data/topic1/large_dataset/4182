Okay so I've seen Romero's dead trilogy about a thousand times. Who needs star wars when zombies are alot more cooler. So yeah Romero puts his cast of survivors in settings like houses, and malls, and for a special few an undergound military base. anyways all hell breaks lose, zombies create havoc and movie ends. I love Romero's zombies flick but they can get a bit formulaic. Fulci puts a different spin on the zombie film with zombie. Sure all hell breaks lose, and zombies create havoc but, there's some great storytelling done. The opening scene is probably as menacing and hair raising as any of the more famous gore scenes. Fulci also uses some great visuals. The settings are as beautiful with zombies as they are without. Sure inhabiting a mall might entertain audience fantasies, but how about tropical landscapes. I love the giallo twist put on the movie also. Rather than having social commentaries like commercialism is evil, fulci gives the film mystery by having the clues revealed in some horrific, and violent ways. The end scene is probably as memorable and classic as watching Ben die in  "Night". I understand where the negative reviews may come from. Romero was great at having killer audience grabbers in his films. Zombie is like the chaotic news set scene in dawn for 3/4 of the film. The other 1/4 is killer living dead action. There's good reason why zombie is not just another film about zombies terrorizing suburbia. Great locations, cinematography, and FX keep it praise worthy.
