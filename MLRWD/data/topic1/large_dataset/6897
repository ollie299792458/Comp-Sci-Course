Serpico came out in 1973 right around the time Al Pacino was at his best, and every film he made was not only a classic, but also had a performance from him that earned an Oscar nod. Coming out right after the Godfather, this is the film that was all about Al, though the Godfather is a timeless classic it is often looked at as Brando's movie, while Serpico gave Al the chance to shine and demonstrate just how talented he was as a lead actor. The script is a fantastic adaptation of the book of the same name and Sidney Lumet does an incredible job, proving himself as one of those great directors that continues to do brilliant work throughout multiple decades. It's the story of a man, isolated by his co-workers because of his morals and intolerance to corruption, the abuse he endures because of it and his prevalence through any obstacle that gets in the way. It is a moving character study that can only be accomplished this well by an actor with incredible talent. Classic 70's cinema from a legendary actor and director.
