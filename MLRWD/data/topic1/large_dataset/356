. . . of Kate Winslet, of Pam Grier, of a great soundtrack, of an intriguing premise, of the beautiful landscape of Australia, of the initial compelling scenes in India . . . I could go on and on about the many missed opportunities here.

Kate Winslet's character, Ruth, starts out as a wide-eyed Australian girl who becomes mesmerized by an ashram in India and its leader.  Her family becomes concerned and concocts a plan to bring her back to Australia and rescue her with the help of a professional deprogrammer.  Somewhere along the line, Ruth is able to emotionally overwhelm the deprogrammer and manipulate him.

Great premise, right?!  Unfortunately, the whole thing is undone by the uneven tone (is it a slapstick comedy? a melodrama? a character study? an erotic film? - it's all of the above! and it doesn't work!) and so many other problems. Ruth's family is cartoonish.  Harvey Keitel, as the deprogrammer, devolves into a complete mess and - by the end - a scary weirdo. Ruth's character was completely inconsistent - maybe the movie was trying to show her evolving over time, but it was all such a mess that I didn't buy it.  The Ruth/deprogrammer relationship was convoluted and unconvincing.  The dialogue was simply laughable at times.  The ending didn't make much sense from all that we'd seen happen - it was like they hit the 2-hour mark and slapped an ending on.

And seriously - has any man ever watched a woman pee down her leg and thought "God, that's sexy!"  Really?!  Perhaps that was the first sign that the deprogrammer wasn't all there, either.
