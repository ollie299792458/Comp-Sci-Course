I read the book "Eaters of the dead" 6 months after I saw the movie. Surprisingly, the book lacked some of the passion that the movie contained. Well, it's not like the movie was whole lot better though, but the battle scenes were better orchestrated than the book portrayed.....with passion and fervour. The movie is however not without its loopholes. Arabs, even today, are rarely without facial hair. In 922 A.D., a clean shaven Banderas would have been branded a "kaffir" in Baghdad and stoned to death or punished in a way similar to those lines. Another misrepresentation is that of the Vikings. Bulwiyf.....a clean shaven dude??? The Vikings were unkempt and uncouth, and yet a few shaved and kept themselves Gillette smooth. Now thats some misnomenclature. Also,according by Ibn Fahdlan's description, the Viking women were sexually wanton. Did we see much of it??? Well, Banderas had a roll in the hay (literally) with one, but then, for the sake of the book, a few wanton scenes could have corroborated to that fact. Furthermore, Diane Venora looked so plebian, it was hard to believe that she was the white shrouded, be-jewelled Queen Weilew. These and more facts somewhat contradict whats' in the book, but the movie is not bad at all. The music is very chilling and apt. The performances by Storhoi (Herger)and Kulich (Bulwiyf) are paces ahead of Bandera's. The climactic battle is very passionately fought, albeit a short one. One may wear a sad face for Bulwiyf in the end, which is possible...or so they say often in the movie. Rent it or buy it, it is worth a couple of views atleast.
