I first watched Little Nicky on DVD in September.  It was very funny, and the bonus material was fun too, even though the DVD menu was a little hard to follow.  Then it came on one of the cable movie channels, and it was in rotation every minute. It grew on me each time.  There was a very nice explanation for Heaven and Hell, and it was from the works of Adam Sandler.  ... "You're such a nice looking boy. You shouldn't hide your face."  Every person in Hell gets his come-uppance, in one way or another.  Seeing a Harlem Globetrotters game go awry is a site itself. Two things I didn't understand though. One, the two heavy meddlers hanging around Nicky.  Why? Wouldn't they rather hang around with the two evil brothers than Nicky? 2. The homosexual roommate or not homosexual roommate. He kept denying it. Was he a real life Ambiguously Gay Duo guy? No biggie, just irritating.  Sandler seems to have a problem with the "Gay" issue.  See "Big Daddy" for further examples.  Overall, this was a bright happy Devil in New York movie.  Reese Witherspoon is a delight in a pre-cursor of her "Legally Blonde" character.  Henry Winkler is trooper as "Henry Winkler".  Ozzy is Ozzy, using his trait, as a Bat-Biter to it's full potential.  BTW, this is the 3rd great character performance by Rhys Ifan as Adrian, the smart evil brother. See, "The Replacements" and "Notting Hill", for the other two.  Patricia Arquette is wasted though, as Nicky's girlfriend.  The best cameo joke was Clint Howard as Nipples. The nipple rubbing man.  A while ago, a friend of mine used to watch multiple repeats of movies on cable movie channels, and he remembers the movies with twinge of nostalgia. I think I'll feel the same way, in 15 years, when Little Nick is on A and E or American Movie Classics. Check it out and don't be caught by any horny birds. See Jon Lovitz for details.
