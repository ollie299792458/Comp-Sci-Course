This new "30th Anniversary Edition" of Blazing Saddles adds nothing new to from the previous DVD edition which you can still purchase through Amazon for as low as $6.95.  A lot has been said about the additional scenes.  Scenes that were added to the TV version but not in the original movie.  If they had added those scenes into this version of the DVD movie, the DVD would have been called the 30th Anniversary "Extended" Edition.  This is how the major movie distributors rape the consumers.  They will keep releasing Blazing Saddles in a multitude of different formats until, finally, when people are completely exasperated, they will release an edition that has both the theatrical release and the "extended" version.  Why did they not do this from the start ?  Greed.  Do not buy this version of the DVD if you have any other incarnation of this movie (on DVD, VHS or Laser Disc).  The so called "extra features" stink and are not worthy of a compilation included in the 30th Anniversary Edition !
