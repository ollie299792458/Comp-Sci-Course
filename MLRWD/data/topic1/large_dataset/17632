(semi-spoilers alert)
first to get this out of the way: it irked me to no end that jacob never made the leaps and bounds to make his move to anna. she was the one who had the good job, later a promotion, too. what made it so his business was so established he could not possibly relocate? ah, that felt good to vent.

loved the movie, and its well done job in sculpting this relationship. i personally found this resoundingly true to life. and in my situation, as well, one of us just wasn't as committed to making it work in spite of odds/frailty/distance. but things in life aren't usually so simple. relationships deserve a chance to develop at their own pace. just as a good dish, made with right ingredients, still won't turn out right, if rushed or drawn out. in hindsight, the culmination of things between anna and jacob made total sense, given the foundation of their relationship amounted to mere months of time knowing one another before circumstances turned them into mere visitors in each others' lives. their desire for what was had, blinded them both to the reality that it had passed, and they were clinging to something fraying, not thriving. the fights were becoming petty and harsh. this was a portrayal of first love, a practice, if you will. the sentiment and experiences conveyed genuinely, in their naivety, innocence, and intent.

of course, the wishful part of me, stays irked that jacob sat on his duff waiting for anna to move to the US.
