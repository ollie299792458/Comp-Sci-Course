First of all, let me say that this movie isn't for everyone, especially those who don't understand Sam Raimi's intentions. If you're looking for a straightforward horror movie, then you completely missing the point and probably will not like it.

If you can enjoy a movie that blends genres into a single amalgamation of entertainment, then EDII might be right up your alley.

At best, Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn is a tongue-in-cheek work, a riff on the genre as well as a showcase of director Sam Raimi's love of slapstick humor, directoral prowess, and willingness to torture lead actor Bruce Campbell.

Oh, but there's blood. Hundreds of gallons of it. Easily as much as the first movie, and it's more well-done thanks to the budget. Decapitations. Gore. Screams. Laughing lamps and deer heads. Greg Nicotero's effects, as usual, are great.

Much of the fun in watching EDII:DBD is seeing the horrors that the main character, Ash (played by B-Rate genius Bruce Campbell), endures. He's alone for nearly thirty minutes and carries the action with a wide-eyed naivete that is almost maddeningly endearing. His physical comedy is unmatched and the one-liners made him semi-famous.

A remake of the first movie, Evil Dead II should be viewed with the context in mind. It is as well-done as any 80s horror movie with twice the wit and gore simultaneously.
