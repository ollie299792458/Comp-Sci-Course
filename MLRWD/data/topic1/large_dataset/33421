I bumped into this on cable tonight and was very impressed.  This is ideal deadtime viewing.  I'm no horror groupie, and those few I've enjoyed seem to be quite slow-moving with the viewer not on man or the monster's side,  but rather bewteen the two, quietly uring on the the camera's dark fancy  (Dawn of the Dead, Nosferatu).  I was curious to see who directed it and  wasn't surprised to see Cronenberg's name in the credits (the blonde slavic  looker must have been sculpted from an identical mould to that of James  Spader's spouse in Crash).  I thought he made very nice use of what felt  like a standard style of horror cinematography (as well a hint of Tarkovsky  and Solaris), mixing into this formula a twist in the standard attacking  parasite that drew a striking case for the erotic underpinnings of tension  and sensuality that underline the allure of blood and death and the  occasional flesh eating slug.
I haven't got a clue what the dvd of this  is like, but I'm tempted to say go with vhs on this one.  The visuals don't  exactly call out for the most refined quality of picture.  No need to take  my advice, but why pass up the chance to get it on a format destined for a  history of whose charms we will probably recognize as quite in keeping with  those of movies like Shivers.  This one also has a better cover so no  excuse really.
