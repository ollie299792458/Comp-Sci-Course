...when I saw it on TV and I was 12 years old.

Robert Mitchum said the greatest performance he ever gave was as Harry Parker, and the best movie he ever made was this one. And he was so right.

The scene that still gives me goose flesh is the nighttime sequence when Parker, riding his horse slowly along the riverbank, is silhouetted in the moonlight, singing, "Leaning on the Everlasting Arms." The children, sleeping in a barn, are awakened by his song, and John says simply and helplessly, "don't he never sleep?"

Parker is evil personified. And, John, the answer to your question is no. Evil never sleeps.

I'm no film snob, and don't know that much about behind-the-scenes stuff, but pay attention to the lighting and sets. Stanley Cortez' work is breathtaking, whether it's the scene of Shelley Winters in the river with her hair floating like the plant life, or the "honeymoon" scene - where the room and shadows are straight out of the wierd German stuff of the 1920's like Dr Caligari.

Some folks take their movies literally and might not like Night of the Hunter. It's a dream and a parable, meant to scare the bejeesus out of you. On that level, and many others, it works magnificently.

When I first saw this movie, it scared the hell out of me. And  it was the most terrifying movie I had ever seen. It still scares the hell out of me. And, half a century later, it's still the most terrifying movie I've seen. And, without question, a masterpiece.
