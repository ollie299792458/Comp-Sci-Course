Although I like the animated Disney movie more than this tape, I still enjoyed this as a rental.  I watched it twice, which I don't do very often with rentals.  This version is a lot closer to the Wonderland book than the Disney film is.  The only element it contains from "Through the Looking Glass" is the inclusion of Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.  Otherwise it's very much like the Wonderland book, except for the awful changes made to the catipillar.  Lots of the same characters, same sequencing, and same dialogue.

I like the special effects, even if they are a bit cheesy.  Some of the costumes are great and others are not so great.  The sets look very nice.  I think the sets are what really makes the film capture the essence of the book.

I really like how the Gryphon and Mock Turtle made it into this movie.  They really delivered.

I thought the cast was pretty interesting.  Lots of big names.  I still can't figure out why Whoopi Goldberg got top billing.  She wasn't in the movie all that much.  Then again, I guess none of the other characters were either.
