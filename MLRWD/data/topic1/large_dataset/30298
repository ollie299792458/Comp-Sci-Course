Ben Stiller is a good actor, and I give him credit for portraying a genuinely unlikable guy.  But that's it.  If you want to watch a movie with an unlikable lead that is actually entertaining, check out "In a Lonely Place" with Humphrey Bogart.

"Greenberg" is like pretentious "Literary" Fiction turned into a movie.  20-SOMETHING KID WHO LIKED "GREENBERG": "It's like, a Post-modern thing, Man... it's SUPPOSED to be dreadfully dull and pointless and utterly painful to watch... I mean, that's how real life is, ya know what I'm sayin'?"

Real life is indeed awkward and painful, and good movies can portray this in an entertaining way.  But "Greenberg" is not one of them.  For a story to be engaging, we must be able to connect with at least one of the characters.  My favorite character in this film was portrayed by a German Shepherd.  That dog was pretty cool.

I'm not sure how it ever became hip to make movies that are flat, dull, pretentious, plot-less, and awkward (and then have people rave about them as examples of good art)... but I think it started with Wes Anderson.  With "Greenberg," Noah Bambauch has reached an even lower level of mundane, pseudo-important garbage.

Coming Soon... "Greenberg 2: Suicide Watch."
