I liked this movie very much, except the parts that made me want to vomit. I've never seen a film like it, in that it depicts realism in many ways -- real people in realistic situations. I liked the confrontation between medieval and renassance mindsets. We see that in the way young Stephen thinks differently from everyone else. Sometimes that only gives him trouble fitting in and sometimes it's just what the situation requires, but he is always going solo with his thoughts. I also liked how he put all that aside when it came time to just bear down and get through a life-or-death situation, which he did by both thinking and fighting his way out. Also interesting was Agnes' constant failures to choose which way to go. She wasn't mature enough to know who she is and always wanted to have it both ways, which was the cause of much of the story's conflicts.
It was just too foul and disgusting. Around every corner was a rape or a murder or a dead baby. Paul Verhoven is a talented man with some serious demons in him. I will really be glad to have this movie in my personal favorites when I can do a little editing.
