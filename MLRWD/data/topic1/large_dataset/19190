The 4th season of Friends is one of my favorite seasons. It includes Ross's second wedding, Chandler and Monica hooking up, Pheobe's decision to be a surrogate for her brother Frank and his wife, and, of course, Chandler in a box. Some of the best episodes (in my opinion) are-

The One With the Ballroom Dancing- Joey tries to protect Rachel from Mr Treeger (the building superintendant), but ends up getting the girls an eviction notice, and the only way to help them is to give the man dancing lessons.

The One Where They're Going to Party- Ross and Chandler are excited when they're old college friend Mike 'Gandalf' Ganderson, is coming to visit, but then must face facts that they're getting older. Monica insults a restaurant owner- but then gets a job because of it.

The One With the Embryos- After learning of the odds of her getting pregnant, Pheobe is worried she's going to let her brother down. Monica & Rachel hodl a contest against Joey & Chandler to see who knows 'whom' better.

The One With All the Rugby- In order to impress Emily, Ross decides to play rugby. Monica obsesses over a switch in Joey & Chandler's apartment, doing whatever she can to find out what it does. Chandler pretends to move to Yemen (where is Yemen, I've got no idea) so he can escape Janice.

The One With the Worst Best Man Ever- Ross has to decide who he wants as his best man for his wedding, but when Joey's duck eats his grandmother's wedding ring, the bird may have to be sacrificed to get it. Pheobe experiances mood swings as her due date nears.

Season Four is one of my favorite seasons, and all Friends fans should enjoy it.
