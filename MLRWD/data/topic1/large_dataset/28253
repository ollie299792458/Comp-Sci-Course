Some years ago I purchased the 1928 version on VHS. It had, I thought, a superior music and effects soundtrack. This version's background music, to me, somehow did not match the drama unfolding on the screen, especially during the crucifixion and earthquake scenes. Some of the added sound effects, where necessary, were badly out of sync with the picture. You can always tune out the sound, since there was none in 1928. The longer 1927 version, also in this set, contained a few scenes which were justifiably cut from the 1928 release version. They just didn't work. The picture quality in these two DVDs is far better than that of my old VHS version. Some of the color scenes contained significantly more flicker, though, than was apparent in the black and white scenes. The graphics used to explain some scenes, I thought, were done more artistically in the original DeMille production. Having said all that, I still believe that this set is well worth having, especially in any Christian household, and will make a magnificent gift. The set also includes a very useful booklet containing many interesting facts about DeMille, the actors and how the original film was conceived and produced. This, in itself, adds significant value for those who are interested in film history. The depiction of Jesus by H.B. Warner is incredible, inspirational and unforgettable! No one else has or will ever come close to this portrayal of Christ on the screen.
