The film, Contact, spends nearly as much time debating faith versus science, and whether the two can co-exist, as it does in exploring the possibility of extraterrestrial life.  For this reason, not all science fiction fans will love the movie as much as I did.  Jodie Foster (as Ellie)turned in one of her typically stellar performances, and her transformation from a strict "Just the facts, please" scientist to a woman who accepts faith's role in the building of the universe was believable and moving, and it really resonated with me.  Matthew McConnaughey, on the other hand, was horribly miscast as Foster's religious and intellectual counterpart and as her sort-of love interest.  Fortunately, he kept his usual smarmy smirking acting technique to a minimum.

I love the opening of the film which portrays a gradual pullback from a point on Earth to a faraway point in the universe before the visual zooms back into the eye of Foster's character as a child.  I can watch this scene over and over.

Side note with a SPOILER:  I originally saw this film with two friends in the theater when it was released in 1997.  At the conclusion, both made comments about how bizarre it was that Ellie's father was on another planet.  Whaaaat???  I didn't understand how they could possibly have reached that conclusion, especially since the dialogue spoon feeds us the explanation for the alien's appearance.  I thought these two friends were the only people who could possibly have missed this, but in reading through some of the reviews and comments here, I see they were not alone!
