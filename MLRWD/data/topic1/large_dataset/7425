If you are interested in the psychology of social bullies, a.k.a. dictators, do not miss this one.

The documentary will add some unseen footage of this minor character in the gallery of Stalin, Hitler, etc. Also you can exercise your brain pondering why people that seem to be normal and even intelligent in some cases, can have such a limited field vision as to laud this, and by extension any, dictator.

The director of the documentary, Estela Bravo, is a non Cuban filmmaker with strong leftist bias, that for many years has been the darling of the only governmental Cuban studios, and has been given access to material totally out of boundaries to the own Cuban filmmakers.

And that is the norm in The Island of Dr. Fidel: foreigners with propaganda potential get the white glove, nationals are sub-citizens in their own country.

Shame on you Fidel Castro. One only hopes that Estela on the side has been hiding some real relevant material to be shown after the dictator's "biological solution".
