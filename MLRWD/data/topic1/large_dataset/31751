I had high hopes for this movie.  With the cast of McAdams, Keaton, Goldblum, Ty Burell (Phil from Modern Family) and, of course, Harrison Ford who would think that anything could go wrong, but it just falls flat.  It starts off great as McAdams is hired  as the executive producer of a last place morning network show that supposedly is supposed to rival the glorious Today Show.  She comes in and shakes things up, juggles things around and tries to save the show's ratings by bringing in Harrison Ford who plays a disgruntled former anchorman who longs to do REAL news and not fluffy crap.  The dynamics between Ford and Keaton start strong as the two do battle and insult each other and McAdams tries to contain her disappointment in her idol by finding out that he is an ass.  There are a few tender moments and then it seems like they needed to race to the finish.  Suddenly, the characters all see the light at the same time and the grand finale of the movie just leaves you dry.  There are a few funny moments where McAdams forces the weatherman into Jackass style wacky stunts to boost the ratings, but other than that, you don't really feel much for these characters.  The characters seem to flip-flop from being bastards to suddenly being team players.  The story arc here seemed to collapse in on itself.  It did have hints of Working Girl to it, but McAdams never sits still long enough for you to get to know her character on a personal level.  A valiant attempt, but it needed some more work.
