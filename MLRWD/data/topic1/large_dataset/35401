A friend recommended we see this movie so we drove 90 miles to the nearest theatre to view this independant flick. Wow! Now, we have the video and are every bit as impressed. Filmed on location in the vicinity of Montevideo, MN Sweetland exudes a rare authenticity that simply grips the heart and soul. Pastoral settings, migrating geese flying by, the harvest the old fashioned way...it's all there, with great magnificence and integrity. We tend to forget life tensions around 1920, emigration pressures, foreign language miscommunications, ostracism, hard work, the influence of the church and minister...While you're immersed in the story it suddenly hits you that certain contempory issues also echo within this unfolding drama. How many films have you seen lately that are bold enough to go a full ten minutes before the main title comes to view? It's 1 hour 50 minutes long. The ten minute behind the scenes feature reveals what inspired the writer and the director, adding additional dimensions to the moving story. We haven't yet taken in the audio commentary, that'll be next. Buy it, watch it, show it to your kids. Keep your hankies close, it'll tug powerfully at your heart, especially so if you have roots in the great midwest. You'll find why the land can be sweeter than money.
