Watch out for this DVD! The authoring needs to be vastly improved, as does the overall quality of the transfer. I tried four borrowed/rented copies of this edition in attempting to find a copy that my Coby DVD player wouldn't choke on. Finally I ordered a NEW copy, which looked somewhat suspect to me (bootleg? not sure). A big clue was that even though it played, initially the DVD player's display BLINKED continuously! The silk screen printed label on the DVD is also a little off. The picture seemed overly edge-enhanced as well as dull and in need of chroma correction. The second play registered better, and with a few tweaks the anamorphic picture improved, but it's still not up to today's DVD standards. Remember, this disc dates back to 1999 (with paper packaging to match)! Warner Brothers needs to issue a remastered Blu-Ray disc to get the full beauty of the original Techniscope (8 perf) negative, which was selected for preservation in 2005.
So if your copy isn't up to speed, I'd say return it for a full refund.
