These days it is common for parents to take young children to all kinds of scary movies. It was different long ago. No parent would take a young child to an evening movie. What they did was send them to the Saturday horror movie matinee with their older brothers and sisters.

This happened to me in 1954 at the tender age of seven when I was sent with my older sister to see "Them," a science fiction classic about giant mutant ants created in atom bomb testing. The giant ants invade LA, breaking into box cars filled with sugar and killing screaming people left and right, crushing them in their horrific jaws.

I spent most of the movie in the lobby, watching through the curtains they had in those days, too frightened to be in the dark. The WORST thing was that the giant ants made a sound sort of like giant crickets and for several years after I had to talk myself into going to sleep -- "It's just crickets, not giant ants, not giant ants, not giant ..."

It's still a great movie, but I make sure to watch it with the lights on and holding on to my wife.
