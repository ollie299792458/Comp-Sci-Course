This was the seventh and final instalment in the Freddy Krueger series. Well, on his own anyway. For this one Wes Craven, the original creator, decided to breathe new life into his best creation. He got fed up of how Freddy was now so different to the Freddy he had originally created, so he decided to try something a little wackier. Did it pay off? Yes, in my humble opinion!

  The story revolves around all the main cast members who starred in the original 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', as they begin to have terrifying nightmares of a Freddy-type character. This Freddy in their dreams, though, is altered from the Freddy that was seen in the films. He is bigger, more evil (if that's possible), more menacing, more scary looking and darker.

Later on we find out that Wes Craven (playing himself) is writing a script for a new Nightmare film, and according to him an ancient evil has chosen the 'Freddy' look to wreak havoc in the real world. Just a coincidence? I don't think so!

Wes Craven returns to the realms of Elm Street in a film that is significantly darker and scarier than any of the other Freddy films (maybe not the first one). He builds up great suspense throughout, visually stunning and disturbing scenes and a very imaginative story that is full of twists and turns (a great Craven trait).

One thing, though, is the ending. I didn't like it. I felt that it was too rushed, and it showed. The film builds up superbly, and you think that it is going to deliver an exciting and original climax, but it does none of those. But, alas, no film can be perfect.

At the end of the day, though, this film is extremely chilling (especially the first time you see it) and powerful. Something different, but not too different. Give it a try.
