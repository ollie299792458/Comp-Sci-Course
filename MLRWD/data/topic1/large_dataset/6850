Melinda and Melinda has an interesting concept - how a single story could be observed as a tragedy or comedy. Woody then runs with this idea. In order for a direct correlation to be seen between tragedy and comedy, the story needs to be the same, and the problem is that very quickly in the film the tragedy and comedy storylines veer off from each other, introducing new plot elements and new characters. So what you are quite quickly left with is two completely different stories, with some elements in common, but not enough to make you beleive are seeing the same story, just told two different ways (a la Rashomon). And that's just bad writing. A little bit tighter, and a few more gags (I think I laughed about three times), and the film would actually have been pretty good.

In terms of the 'challenging' aspects of the film (i.e. extra-marital affairs, etc), there is nothing here that hasn't been explored in earlier films. Husbands and Wives or Manhattan are far better films that deal with the same issues. I should probably mention that Will Ferrel pulls off a fantastic performance, again. The 'comedy' story is surpisingly short of gags, but where they do appear, Will Ferrel makes the best use of them.

Let me make quite clear - if this was by any other director, it would be a reasonably interesting film. But let's be honest here, we expect more from Woody Allen. This is one the greatest directors in history, a man who made some absolutely superb films - Manhattan, Annie Hall, Hannah and her Sisters, Husbands and Mives, Bananas, Sleeper, etc...the list goes on and on. This compares very poorly against any of these classics. I think we may have to accept that Woody has jumped the shark with this one, and by looks of it, probably for good.
