It is amazing how many films can steal from the ideas of the Blair Witch Project. Although this is intended as a comedy or a statement about the movie industry. The joke is just kind of old now.

This film could of picked any distingushed director to play the part of a " director " and the film still would of made that person seem silly for participating. In fact the whole film seems like it was made just for their own amusement. It has many inside jokes that don't always translate to us. But the main point is ' Why make another fake documentary that is supposed to

trick the viewer? ' I am guessing that was part of the plot due to sections attempting to be dramatic. Or maybe we are just supposed to think from the begining that the Loch Ness myth is not real and it would be ridiculous for anyone to even think so.

This means that we should be laughing from the very begining.

But many people do believe that myths are possibly true. Look at how many real documentaries are done about Loch Ness. Even National Geographic has taken the time to do a few.

If this film from the start took the comedic stand, say like Spinal Tap. Then you could be laughing from start to finish. But the film attempts with these obviously fake scenes of drama and even death to be taken as a possibility that what you are watching is supposed to be true.

In the end Herzog is too good of a director to be playing with this type of film.I would be just as dissapointed if Spielberg or even Cameron participated in a Blair Witch Project rip off. There are much better ways to make fun of the industry.

Look at Cameron's role as himself on HBO's Entourage. Now that is funny.
