After seeing the world premier of the Special Edition of "Spirit of '76" I was not disappointed. I have listen to Mike Church's other audio documentaries which are not only educational but also fantastic. However this movie far surpassed my expectations and was packed with tons of great information that filled in many gaps of this event in history for me.

This movie will take you back in time, and let you see how our founding fathers debated and ratified the US Constitution. There was real debate over how the States should be governed if at all, not just the fairytale that I was taught in the public education system. What I enjoyed about this movie was 3 fold. First the sound was incredible, the rain falling and lighting outside Independence Hall sounded so real and it really helped set the scenes. Second the illustrations and video work helped me watch each scene and take in visually what it would have looked like in the late 1780's. Lastly, the movie was not just "educational" but I felt I was learning and being entertained all at the same time. Isn't that what we all want? Finally a movie that teaches how the worlds most famous document.

Overall 5 stars. Anyone who wants to learn and be educated should by this movie. Also if you have kids this is a must have, I know my niece and nephew love anything animated. Why not let them learn at the same time. Thanks Mike for another wonderful production!
