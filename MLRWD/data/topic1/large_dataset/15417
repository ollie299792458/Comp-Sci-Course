I went to see this movie thinking that it would be very stupid.  However, it was better than Scary Movie I & II.  It had a plot and kept you interested in what was going to happen.  AND very funny!!!  I read all of the reviews before I decided to post mine.  I would have to agree that those that did not like this movie are experiencing what Black folks have suffered all of their history in America.  "Birth of a Nation, Black people could not protest, there was no NAACP to call.  The many tapes of Black Face that white folks showed their families as entertainment for years on sunday evenings, no protest from Black folks because they might end up dead.  I think that White people get upset about stuff like this because they have always had the "Right of Passage" to be racist and cruel.  So back at ya...I say.  I really do not think that if the powers that be thought this movie would do any damage to white folks it ever would have made it on the big screen.  I think that those that thought this movie was racist probally are racist themselves.  I went to see it with white friends and there were white people behind me and they were crying with laughter.  So... for those who are screaming that this is a racist movie, look at your own daily behavior....you just might learn something.
