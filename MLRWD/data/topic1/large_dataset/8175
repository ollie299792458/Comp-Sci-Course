Wow.  This movie's emotional and comedic range spans from A to B.  My son wanted to see this film so I coughed up the moolah and sat through this tangled, incipid film.

We've all been through this before: star cast, "funny" premise, too many script writers, jokes and gags that sounded a LOT better on paper and actors hamming it up in an attempt to conceal the weakness of the material.  I think they knew that this was going to be a turkey and they wanted to sail through their lines and escape to their trailers and take a long, cleansing shower to wash it all off.

A plot summary would put too much of a burden on a reader and it would give me Surviving Christmas flashbacks, so I demur.  Seriously, the funniest part of this whole movie is the opening credits sequence.  Now, this is before we meet any of the characters and before we have the responsibility of caring for any of the people in this film foisted upon us, ye suckers.

Duck and cover as this one passes you all by.
