DON'T BUY IT AT ALL!!
I bought that as a Christmas gift. Why? The actors and the one who made the movie were the reason.
The result is COMPLETE DECEPTION. I am a fan of swordfighting movie and watched more than 3 dozens martial art movies. But this is worst than amateur. 
I don't know why the two main actors picked this script. Were they out of money?
The bad points:
.There's no real story.
.The useless speeches last at least 95% of the movie.
.The speeches are done by secondary actor( what they call dragon nine)
.The action scenes use acceleration process in a pathetic way.
So we watched the movie after Christmas. I was on the sofa...
waiting for the story to begin . The first five minutes seemed OK. BUT then the next 45 mn, a secondary character was making some stupid jokes and I was saying " what is that imbecile doing there in that movie". Then there is a 5 mn action part. Then AGAIN the stupid talks. At the end there's 10 mn fighting. And then You'll ask :" was that a movie"
THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE YOU'LL EVER SEEN.
NOBODY can come up with worst. ....
I am HONEST writing that review so others won't do the same error.
