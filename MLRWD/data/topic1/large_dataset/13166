This is my favorite movie of all time. Typically, movies that are adapted from great novels (and the novel is outstanding) aren't nearly as good as the novels themselves. Cuckoo's Nest is one of those very, very rare exceptions. In the novel, the story is told through the eyes of The Chief while in the film, the story is told through the eyes of McNulty (Nicholson). This is an excellent choice as the film would not have worked through the eyes of a mostly silent character.
The direction by Forman is brilliant and the screenplay and cinimatography are top knotch but the acting towers over everything. Everyone knows that the performances by Nicholson and Fletcher are amazing, and they certainly are, but the rest of the cast is excellent as well. The casting is simply flawless. The ensemble has future popular character actors DeVito and Lloyd among others who were unknowns at the time. 
I've probably seen this film a dozen times and I still laugh in the beginning and am furious at the end. This is a movie that has withstood the test of time and, like Gone With the Wind a generation before, should be considered a model of how to adapt a screenplay.
