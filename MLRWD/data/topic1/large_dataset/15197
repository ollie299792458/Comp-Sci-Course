Amazon has lumped in a lot of reviews for earlier DVD editions of the films contained within the new MGM double-feature disc, and in doing so unfairly gives readers the idea that the DVD released on September 20, 2005 looks terrible.

I'm happy to report that this is not the case.  PANIC IN YEAR ZERO looks great and includes not only closed-captioning for the first time, but also the theatrical trailer that includes a snippet of a scene at the ranch house not seen in the film itself.  The film itself takes on a darker tone in these post-Hurricane Katrina days (looting in the streets, a town cutting of evacuees from coming into their town, gas stations jacking up gas prices due to the crisis, the law breaking down, etc.), and it is not a film waiting for a MST3K-ing from viewers even if the title sounds like it would be; so keep that in mind.

Meanwhile, this has to be the best print I've ever seen of LAST MAN ON EARTH, and I've had several video and DVD prints of it in the past.  Plus, it is also closed-captioned, which is a definite plus for anyone who is HOH or deaf who has been longing to understand all the dialogue in this film.  Plus, any chance to see and hear Richard Matheson talk is another great bonus.

If you're interested in either of these two films, this is definitely worth the purchase.
