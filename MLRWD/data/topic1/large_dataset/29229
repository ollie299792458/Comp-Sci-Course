The Lucio Fulci classic gets another dusting off, new cover, clearer transfer?, debateable. The film begins in the Caribbean, where a scientist shoots a undead corpse in the head. "The boat can leave now." Cut to New York, the said sailing ship is drifting in the bay. Cops go onboard and are prompty dispatched by a ravenous zombie. Thus Fulci's blood soaked epic begins. The film has some really extreme gore scenes, zombies are dispatched with bullets to the head, being set on fire and other gruesome methods. The dead body count is high and the humans don't fair much better. One bit of trivia, when the zombies are walking over Brooklyn Bridge watch the cars below. Fulci couldn't get permission to film in New York so had to get shots as quick as possible before the police would stop them, hence the New York traffic going about it business while the world is being overrun by the undead. Overall the film is pretty entertaining. In the UK when this was first released there was over 3 minutes of cuts. Still today the official UK release is cut.
