this is a review of the DVD and not the film. I don't think I could add any more to what has already been said about one of John Wayne's best but seldom seen films until it was released on video. It was made in 3D in 1953 before movies were made in wide screen. I was really looking forward to the blu-ray release. Unfortunately, they letterboxed a movie that was not made in wide screen. They simply cut the bottom and top of the picture off. If you have seen the film as it was meant to be seen you can tell. Starting in 1956 the studios told their dirctors that if they were going to shoot a film in standard 1.33 to 1 ration that their movies would be cropped in the theaters and to shoot their films accordingly. This lead to a number of films having some dead space at the top or bottom of the film. manyd films such as "Support Your Local Sheriff" and "The Devil at 4 O'Clock" were filmed that way. Hondo was made before this practice was started. For me this is unforgivable and I will be returning my blu-ray. This is the same as releasing a widescreen movie in pan and scan.
