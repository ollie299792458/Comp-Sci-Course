Ok, I am an 18 year old male who knows what I like.  I like all sorts of things.  Including hardcore bloody videogames, horror movies, cars, and Seseme Street Presents Follow That Bird.  See, even though I am really into guy things, I am kind of soft in heart.  I like disney movies too.  But doesn't anybody?  The point I am trying to make here is, well, Follow that Bird can be enjoyed even by adults.  It is funny, sad, and just plain fun to watch.
I first saw this movie in my childhood when it was normal for a kid like me to watch Seseme Street and Mister Rogers and all that cool stuff.  And when I saw Follow that Bird on TV while flipping the channels, I instantly loved it.  How can you not love Big Bird walking around the united states while his friends come to his aide?  I mean, there is so many wacky things put in this movie its just great.
But, now, after all these years, I found this movie in [local store].  I shrieked like a school girl in London because I previously contacted Warner Brothers and Seseme Street online to ask if a re-release was possible, and they made it apparent that the answer was no.  But months later here it is.  And its coming on DVD too.  You can be sure this 18 year old is getting the DVD version when its out.
