This is a great movie!  The two old coots are really off the mainstream and don't give a damn what everyone thinks.  They've lived an "interesting" life.  But even though they're eccentric, they don't allow the scam artists who think they can take advantage of them--there's a rumor the old guys have lots of money--to make them fair-pickin's.  They have shotguns and know how to use them!  They're really feisty old gents with a laid-back sense of humor.  The boy who's dropped off for the summer by his lame-brain mother is their nephew, and there's other relatives who are trying to get the so-called money the men have.  The boy really gets an education, hears the fascinating stories of their lives, and comes to love the old men.  There's so many unusual twists to this movie that you have to see it to appreciate the humor and the way the story deals with the fundamental issues of life for the young boy and the old men.  The casting and acting are SUPERB!  I have several copies of this movie because it's a KEEPER.
