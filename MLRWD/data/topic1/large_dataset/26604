I've been a massive John Sayles fan for years but I'm sad to say that "Silver City" fails to deliver on the promises of his previous efforts.

The story centers on a man named Dickie Pilager (a wickedly funny Chris Cooper) a slow witted member of a political dynasty running for Governor of Colorado backed by the big mining interests.  While shooting a campaign ad, the candidate uncovers a dead body and an investigation begins.

Unfortunately the tantalizing premise fails to deliver as the movie shifts its focus to a journalist working (a bland Danny Huston) on the story as it follows him on a convoluted path that takes him to Pilager's wayward black sheep sister (a hilariously menacing Daryl Hannah) and others tied in various ways to the campaign and its less that virtuous games while crossing paths with an old flame (a forgettable Maria Bello).

"Silver City" is not without its moments, particularly in some sharp performances by many in the cast, but unfortunately the normally astute Sayles seems to try to coast on the stellar cast and begins to lose control of the material about a third of the way through the film.  Even substandard Sayles has more to offer than 99% of the tripe that floods the cineplex's these days but the simple fact of the matter is that this one does not hang together well enough to recommend to anyone but the ultimate Sayles completists.
