There seems to be a renewed passion for "snow while" this summer as there are already two big-budget movies on this old-time kid's classic. It's definitely a pleasant surprise to stumble upon this one - so little known but still worthwhile (at least I've never heard of it until most recently).

Overall, I enjoyed the mood and the twists of this movie. The development of the lead characters are very interesting: the queen did not start out being evil but gradually descended into evil madness as the tension between her and the "snow white" grew and her hope for a son was forever lost. On the other hand, Lilian ("snow white" in this movie) wasn't exactly an epitome of innocence and kindness. Instead, she was quite spoiled and somewhat arrogant at the beginning, but later learned to be more compassionate and responsible through a strings of events.

I also liked  how the romance is played out here - a bit under-toned, so that it doesn't overshadow the spooky/dark elements while you still sense the strong feelings there.

Now to the downside, Since this is a rather old movie, possibly on a relatively low budget, the settings,music,special effects, etc are not exactly mesmerizing. The performances are good across the board, but nothing spectacular either. I'm not too crazy about Sigourney Weaver's look as the queen. The plot line evolves ok but could have used a bit more detail to flow better.

Overall, a satisfying viewing experience for someone like me who enjoys a bit of dark fantasy.
