Chances are, if you're reading this, you're already a fan of Japanese sf/monster films, so I'll cut to the essentials.
This is a wonderful package, the kind many of us have learned to expect from Classic Media, including the attractive paperboard case for this two disc set. You are really getting 4 films, not counting the featurette on special effects. You get the two versions of each primary film, Rodan in English (with an annoying narrator who I thought unnecessary and irritating) and Japanese  with subtitles (and without the added-for-American-audiences narrator), and the same treatment for War of the Gargantuas. As another reviewer commented, Rodan, the giant pterodactyl, never looked better than in this first appearance, who would be teamed up with Godzilla in later films. The second disk contains the venerable slugfest, War of the Gargantuas, both in its English version (where we hear a rather subdued Russ Tamblyn deliver lines in his own voice, sounding a little wry, particularly when he offers a sarcastic line) and again the Japanese version, longer and more explanatory in relating the film as a sort of sequel to the earlier Frankenstein Conquers the World.
So there you have it, two complete versions of each primary film in DVD and a special featurette in an attractive case. What could be reasonably better?
