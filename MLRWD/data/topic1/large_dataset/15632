The game is perhaps the most least understood of David Fincher's movies. While Fight Club and Seven wear their premise on their sleeves The Game invokes expressions of bewilderment and indignation from first time viewers. It was only after I had watched it for the 3rd time that I realized that I understood it. The movie itself is well crafted and fast paced. It has a first class cast and produciton quality. Michael Douglas and Sean Penn are two accomplished actors and they are in good form here. Douglas especialy is spot on as the bewildered and confused banker whose tranquil life is suddenly turned upside down as he redeems a gift coupon given to him by his brother played by Penn. The gift coupon belongs to a company which promises to bring a bit of spice and vitality back in Douglas' life. But it is actually a passport to hell. As the game progresses Douglas' life is turned upside down. He is left homeless and pennyless and $600 million stolen from his bank. Either everyone is part of this elaborate practical joke or this nightmare is for real, you will never be able to guess till the end. Even after the end you are left a little dazed and confused. What we don't realize is that deliberately or perhaps unintentionally Fincher is commenting on the human condition. Have'nt there been times when we feel as if it is fate that sometimes plays the most important part in what we turn out to be.
