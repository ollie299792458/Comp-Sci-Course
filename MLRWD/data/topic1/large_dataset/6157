Is a principle worth the sacrifice of the greater good? What if the agent of that change is not who you thought they were? Questions regularly posed in politically-themed dramatic efforts and so posed in this latest offering from long-time Hollywood favorite George Clooney and the recent favorite of movie-goers Ryan Gosling.

  Stephen Meyers (played by Gosling) is a veteran of numerous political campaigns and a revered media maestro. He's in a bitter contest seeking the Democratic Party nomination for his candidate. That being Mike Morris, the governor of Pennsylvania (played by George Clooney). Because of peculiar voting rules, his is most likely going to be defeated by Republican voters who are voting in their opponents' primary in hopes of seeing a weaker candidate that they could trounce in a general election. With another upcoming primary that, if won, could clinch the nomination. To win the latter contest, however, they would need to strike the kind of deal that the candidate refuses to make on moral grounds. All this is merely the foreground while the background is replete with backstabbing and illicit affairs.

  I am not one of those who only recently heard of Gosling thanks to much-lauded efforts such as Blue Valentine, Drive, and Crazy, Stupid, Love. I have known of him since the independent 2001 film The Believer. And he is true-to-form here as a man who's greatest weakness is his faith in his leaders and purpose. Everyone, Clooney, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, are doing superior jobs in compelling roles. That said, my tastes run more toward films that show American politics closer to what we wish it was, not what it actually is. Dave, The American President, and The Contender to name three. This isn't that.
