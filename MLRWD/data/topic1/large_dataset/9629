For those of you who know the Hitch Hiker's Guide as only a book, a brief lesson of how this DVD evolved is in order. Adams was never a writer, nor did he want to be. For that reason, his ideas began as a collaborative radio show. That show was adapted to this TV series, and those TV episodes were adapted into the famous book. The TV episodes stand out mostly for Peter Jones's renditions of the Guide against simplistic, yet effective animation. The DVD does not stand out for the acting or the special effects. Zaphod Beeblebrox's extra head is worse than the shark in Jaws 3D.

That being said, the insight shown in the documentaries makes the DVD worth the price. Where most DVD's slap together five poorly-written and unrelated featurettes, the movie-making documentaries on this DVD are all insightful and interesting. The biography on Douglas Adams alone would be a must have for any fan. And while Zaphod Beeblebrox's extra head may well be an example of the worst special effect's in Sci-Fi history: The documentary about that specific prop was enough to make me stop complaining about it.
