Very well done- good casting- like "Margin Call"- a behind the scenes look at the economic collapse. I can only assume that other media- radio- tv- (altho this IS HBO) and especially print media were either too dumb, too lazy or in cahoots with Wall Street too closely to want to tell the story as it is told here.

How capitalism due to its inherent greed came close to destroying itself- which-one can imagine, and certainly hope (it is such a bad system) it eventually will. Banks should be nationalized- one big bank that serves the people.

Capitalism puts profits before people.

The collapses are cyclic- going back into the 1800's as the system came into being- an advance for a few short years at the beginning.

The elephant in the US room is capitalism- but this is a country that does not wish to see elephants. It does not wish to see the suffering global markets cause around the world- don't show us the orphan girls picking over dumps in Rio and Calcutta.

Not that the film preaches- but, finally, as no where else- it shows what went on and what is going on.
