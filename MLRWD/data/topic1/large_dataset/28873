I won't lie, I did not care for this movie when I first watched it back in 1987 and pretty much put it out of my head since then. recently, my wife had bought one of those cheap dvd collections of movies like Deep Red, Cat O' nine Tails, Last Man On Earth, Night Of The Living Dead, ect. But what did I see included with these gems? House By The Cemetery. So, feeling nostalgic for bad taste, I popped some popcorn, grabbed me a hard lemonade and sat down to give this Lucio Fulci offering a second look. Well, believe or not, I actually enjoyed it, with some minor complaints which, by the way, reminded me why I didn't care for it the first time around. First I'll talk about the negatives, not enough details about Freudstein's motive, he's a paper thin type killer with not a whole lot of depth. The same I would say about the other characters as well, who did not put up much of a fight against a slow moving, maggot filled corpse. The kid (Bob) voice dubbing is downright annoying, I almost put the volume on mute whenever he was going to talk. (I'd rather listen to a whining 2 year old with nasal issues than hear "Bob" again!) Positives: awesome soundtrack, good cinematography, a few well pace suspensful scenes creating the right atmosphere for an otherwise creepy horror film. Oh, did I mention the gory murder scenes? Makes Friday The 13th look like Romper Room! Hmm, maybe it was it the six pack and a half of hard lemonade that made this film more bearable a second time around. Ah, nonethless, I did like House By The Cemetery and would probably pick up a copy of the Anchor Bay release as an addition to my growing collection of Italian horror films. Besides for a walking maggot farm, Dr. Freudstein is a pretty cool monster!
