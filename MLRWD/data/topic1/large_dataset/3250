Hilarious, incredible, cynical and just about every emotion and nuance are on display in this vibrant film about that great comedy team. 
Matthau is simply at his zenith as W. Clark, king of all Kvetchers and mostly everything else. You should be warned...Matthau,s gate contains so much body language that you cant resist.Once in a great while he does listen to a very frustrated Dick Benjamin( who is terrific). Mr. Clark, cant open his own door easily, gets trappped in elevators..cant read directions ..cant find or read the copy...and lives in a world where seemingly everyone has gone mad..except for him.??
Through the laughs we see some meloncholy...just a bit mind you but enough. Burns is droll as ever as Mr Clark's old partner..
During one of the most funniest bits ever Clark gets " Fingered" and " Spritzed" Al this while he issues his revenge with a high pitched " ENTER"..
Truly a one of a kind film..its almost heartbreaking to know that a film like this can never ..never be made again..EVER!
