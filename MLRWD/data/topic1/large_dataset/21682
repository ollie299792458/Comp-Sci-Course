I had high hopes for vantage point, a movie in which Dennis Quaid and Forrest Whitaker play significant roles.  It is a very short movie and personally I think the reason they show the movie from 5 different angles is because they did not have enough of a story line to put together a full 90 minute film.

Be ready immediately to watch the first 10 minutes of the movie 5 separate times and then on the 6th time watch it from all the angles until the finish.  Honestly none of the so called Vantage Points are that convincing or shocking.  It is fairly easy from the beginning to pick out who the terrorists are.  One thing that was extremely frustrating was that the movie made the U.S. secret service look like a bunch of incompetent idiots that had no training.

Yes the action is entertaining with one of the most unrealistic car scenes I have ever seen but I think there are so many better choices out there to watch a good action flick.  I advise you, pass on this movie and 90 minutes of your life will be saved.
