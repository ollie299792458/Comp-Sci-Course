The Magnificent Seven finds its way into every serious discussion about the best classic westerns. It is easily my favorite. Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson and Eli Wallach, in one of his juiciest roles ever - this is the western that you watch again and again. True, it is a remake of "The Seven Samurai," but it takes a backseat to no other film in its genre. Seven American gunfighters - a Dream Team, of sorts - are hired to guard a Mexican village from Banditos that return every season to take whatever crops the villagers have grown. Stellar cast, but just as magnificent is the musical score by Elmer Bernstein, who was nominated for an Academy Award.

It is unfortunate that the studio has chosen to issue an entire set of Mag 7 films as a package. The other three films - Return of the Seven, Magnificent Seven Ride! and Guns of the Magnificent Seven - don't belong in the sentence, let alone the same box. Do yourself a favor - buy the original Magnificent Seven (Blu-Ray) as a single. It deserves 5 stars by itself.
