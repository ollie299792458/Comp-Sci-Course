Clever, enjoyable cartoon take-off on horror movies, substituting the title characters for Abbott and Costello, and communicating a message about humane treatment of animals.  But parents beware:  it is too scary for younger children up to age 8 or so.

Well developed relationship between Wallace and Gromit, with a nice turnabout between "master" and "pet".  Bunnies are adorable.  Background touches clever.  Among the homages paid to classic horror movies such as "Werewolf," "Frankenstein" and "The Fly," I patricularly love the hairdo tribute to Elsa Lanchester in "Bride of Frankenstein" (character of Lady Tottington).  Some of possible other tributes may include to David Lynch's "Angriest Dog in the World," "Little Shop of Horrors" and "Frenzy" (note pictures on wall at Lady Tottington's house and compare to pictures in apartment of necktie strangler).

Having said that however, it seems all too trendy for animated films these days to substitute homages to movie genres for originality.
