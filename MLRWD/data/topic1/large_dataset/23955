After years of dreaming that Disney might bring this title to DVD, FINALLY it is here and oh man was it worth the wait. All three episodes have been digitally restored in high definition from the original negative and soundtrack. The episodes were originally filmed in movie aspect ratio and are now presented as they were originally filmed. The result is that you can now see and hear things that you never could before.  The images and sounds will leap out of your screen/home theatre. And to top it off, the original introductions by Uncle Walt are included which I have not seen since I saw these episodes originally on the "Wonderful World of Color" in 1964. It is clear the people who produced this DVD made it a labor of love.  My only complaint, and it is a small one, is that I would have liked to have seen more interviews with some of the original cast and production personnel (though even the short pieces with Patrick McGoohan were enough to bring tears to my eyes.)

From all of us who have loved this story since we were small, thanks to Disney for doing it the justice it deserved.  If you have not bought it yet, don't miss it !!!!
