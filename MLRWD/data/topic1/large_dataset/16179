This movie is brilliant in the most meaningful sense of the word. The acting is flawless. The characters are richly drawn. The direction is crisp. The scenes of devastation and pain are, incredible as it seems, poetically rendered. This, to me, is what film-making strives to be, and seldom achieves, profoundly moving story-telling.

The emotional resonance is at once: wrenching, chilling, yet ultimately transcendant. It's about life, love, faith, fear, guilt.

On a personal level, I feel profoundly changed by this movie. For me, that moment of "epiphany" (if you will) comes at the point in the film where Max realizes he needs the salvation that the love of his wife represents, and admits to her "I want you to save me".

I advise this film to anyone who wishes to FEEL something more than the "thrill" of a car chase or experience a message more profound than, oh... say, "hookers that look like Julia Roberts have hearts, too, and can nab guys like Richard Gere". This film is so far beyond the normal escapist fare that Hollywood specializes in.

As a final illustration, consider the case of my 17 year old son. Here's a young man as hip to current culture as anyone, whose sensibilities have been shaped by the usual suspects of rap, MTV, video games, movies, and all the rest. Upon seeing this movie with me, he freely admitted how good it was. And, as a dad, I feel it made him just a bit more perceptive to the range of experiences and emotions "out there".
