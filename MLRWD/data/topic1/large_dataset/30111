Maybe I am too much of a realist, or am spoiled by contemporary movies, but there were things about this film that were just too illogical. To begin with, what was the point of faking Edgar Brodie's (John Gielgud) death so he could be sent out as a spy for England? Supposedly his death was faked because he was well known. After his funeral, he was given a fake name and passport and sent off on his mission. Why not just simply give him the fake name and passport without the fake death? There was no point to it. Furthermore, would British intelligence really send out someone like the character Madeleine Carroll played (Else) to do a dangerous spy mission? (She had no stomach for the dark arts of espionage, and even questioned that the German spy was a spy because he was so "nice.") Would British Intelligence really send out the fake couple Mr. and Mrs. Ashenden (Gielgud and Carroll) without any training? And as for the ending, Peter Lorre putting down the gun next to Robert Young was just too stupid.
