Although forgotten or largely discounted today, Huey Long came closer to  becoming a total dictator than any other American.  This film by Ken Burns  brings the power and presence of Long into to its proper context of a poor  and desperate state in the throes of a crippling despression.  Burns  illustrates this documentary with excellent interviews with Long's  contemporaries, constituents, friends and opponents.  There is also  revealing footage of Long himself that reflects his intended image of a  "countrified buffoon," which caused his enemies to fatally  underestimate him.  This documentary brings Long back to life as a  veritable dictator who might have won the presidency if not for his  assasination.  
The film's main strength lies in its balanced approach to  this controverisal figure.  Although Burns interviewed many of Long's  enemies, he also sought the opinion of the average Lousiana citizen who  benefited from Long's provision of free text books and hospital care.  These people were Long's source of strength and power and regard him as a  great man.  Again, Burns balances the man who provided relief to a  struggling people, and the dictator who compromised democracy in order to  provide that relief. An excellent documentary.
