"Bloodsucking Freaks" is indeed as demented and campy as its reputation suggests, but I found it to be much more dark and disturbing than do most who have seen the film.  This has mainly to do with just what exactly it is that the evil Sardu (Seamus O'Brien) does to the young women he and his dwarf henchman Ralpus (Louis DeJesus) have kidnapped in order to participate in his sadomasochistic stage shows.  Simply put, he psychologically traumatizes them to the point that they are stripped of their humanity and turned into unthinking animals.  In my opinion, this is a fate truly worse than just torture or death.  Much like the state authorities in George Orwell's "1984," Sardu doesn't just want to enslave and murder these women, he wants them to actually love him as he is doing it.  The fate of the kidnapped ballerina Natasha deNatalie (Viju Krem) is the worst of all, as he brainwashes her so that she herself will commit murder in his next production.  Can you think of anything more cruel and evil than forcing an innocent person to become a murderer?  Well, that is exactly what happens to poor Natasha in the film.  No matter how funny you find Sardu and Ralphus's antics to be, you simply can't deny the essential darkness and tragedy at the heart of "Freaks'" story.  As a humanist who values life and liberty, I simply could not watch this film, as I have done twice, and not consider its darker implications.
