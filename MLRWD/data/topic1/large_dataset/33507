My one question is, for those who have a copy of this particular DVD edition being advertised here: is this particular version a multi-, or all-region DVD? I live in the U.S., and I'd really like to get THIS version due to all the special features, but obviously I don't wanna get it if it's not even going to play in my DVD player... anyone know??

But for those who aren't wound so tightly as to be offended by the risque premise (a buncha students are kidnapped, taken to an island, and given weapons to kill one another off), and HAVEN'T had the privilege of seeing this wickedly entertaining film, you owe yourself to do so. Fans of transgressive art, black comedy, dead baby jokes, Takeshi Miike, Bret Easton Ellis, Palahniuk, and Tarantino will be right at home watching it (case in point, not only is this one of Tarantino's favorites, its influence on him is evidenced by his casting this film's Chiaki Kuriyama to play Gogo in his own "Kill Bill"). Take it from me though and skip the unengaging sequel. Also recommended: "Series 7: The Contenders."
