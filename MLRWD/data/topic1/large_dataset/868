have always loved Time Travel as a topic. I thus naturally enjoy Time Travel movies and books, even if they don't always make sense. This movie did make more sense that the Average turnaround Time Travel adventure, and managed to capture H. G. Wells's Socialism and quaint Victorian attitude quiet well. Not perfectly of course but they did seem to want you to like Wells and how he was in real life may offend Modern Viewers, even in 1974.

The story was a bit Contrived, featuring Jack the Ripper, who just-so-happens to be friends with H. G. Wells, who Just-So-Happens to have a Convenient Time Machine which Just-So-Happens to need a Key to hold it in the time it visits which Wells keeps on him. It also Just-So-Happens that the Police find the Ripper in Wells's estate and he uses the Machine, minus the needed Key to lock it, to get away. Its also a bit contrived that he somehow manages to end up in California even though the Machine vanished from London and could not traverse space.

However, if you get past all of this, it's a fun ride. The performances from McDowell and David Werner are especially great, and they manage to capture the Victorian personality traits they are suppose to hold very, very well. You'd think they were form the 19th Century personally!

The Love Story is a bit dodgy but manages to suck you in too, and the Adventure keeps your attention to the end.

I don't want to drop Spoilers ( not that other reviewers haven't already) so I won't be much more thorough than this, suffice to say if you are a Time Travel Enthusiast you will like this Movie. Those who like Romance are likely to like it. Its also a good afternoon time killer (Pun not intended; well almost not intended) for those how just want a nice straight forward adventure.
