I only have a few thoughts to add to what other reviewers have said, but here they are.

The music on this disc is aggressive in the same vein as "It's About That Time (Live at the Fillmore East)", but more dense, and with a deeper groove. While other concerts of the period suffer from excessive noodling, here Holland and DeJohnette provide a steady anchor that keeps things from drifing too far. In fact, all bandmembers are in excellent form. Miles' tone is much clearer than in his later 1970s recordings, and he hasn't yet turned to the wah pedal. Keith Jarrett, despite his protestations, makes a great addition on the organ.

The band stomps through a mix of material from '69-70. By this time, of course, individual songs were no longer distinguishable: they're merely themes and phrases that Miles calls up at will. That said, the setlist goes something like this:

Directions

Bitches Brew

It's About That Time

Sanctuary

Spanish Key

And, in a surprise move, the interviewers are actually worth listening to! Hancock, Holland, DeJohnette, Airto, Corea, Cosey, Liebman and Mtume all share some insights and anecdotes, though I recommend skipping Santana and Joni Mitchell.

Hearing "A Different Kind of Blue" has convinced me that Columbia should reconsider the editing decisions made on other live recordings of this era, like the sadly flawed "At Fillmore". Music like this deserves to be heard unaltered. And surely there's some footage of Miles' 1973-75 bands waiting for an official release...?
