When filling out a list of my favorite movies, this movie is #1.
I went to see this at the theater with my sister, knowing nothing about it except for having seen the trailer.  At one point in the movie, I screamed out loud.  I have never ever in life done that before at a movie.  And suprisingly... 85% of the other people in the theater did as well, including my sister, whose fingernails I had to then forcibly remove from my wrist/skin.  At another point, every hackle, every hair on the back of my neck and forearms, every fiber of my being came to attention and I was riveted to the screen.
That, my friends, is what I deem excellence in a movie.
Nicole Kidman delivers an oscar worthy performance.  Very Grace Kelly in her inherent classy, graceful demeanor.  The performance of a lifetime - I've never seen her better.
The children - oh the children were excellent.  They portrayed anger, fear, sullenness, intelligence...  They WERE those children.
The house played an important part as well, dark shadows... ambience... mystery... 
This movie doesn't rely on blood, gore, facemasks, knives, profanity, or sex.  It speaks to you on a more cerebral level in a very intelligent manner and I predict you will get SO swept away that you will scream as well.  ;-)
Don't let anyone tell you about this movie.  Put the kids to bed, go to the bathroom, get your popcorn and your drink, turn out the lights -- no interruptions and pausing of movie is allowed.  lol  It's a 'buy', not a 'rent'.
