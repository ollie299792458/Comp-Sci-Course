I found this film more valuable as an exploration of 1930s science and social mores than as entertainment.  Cathy Holly (Elizabeth Taylor) is a traumatized girl whom everyone has a stake in shutting up--everyone, that is, except the doctor slated to perform an obviously inappropriate lobotomy upon her (Monty Clift).  Elizabeth Taylor delivers a strong if sometimes overwrought performance as Cathy.  Katherine Hepburn gives a textured performance as the eponymously named Mrs. Venable, Cathy's venerable, manipulative, and delusional aunt.  Mercedes McCambridge is appropriately annoying as Cathy's ignoramus of a mother.  Clift can't quite overcome the inherent limitations of his character, whose main purpose seems to be to serve as a foil for the others.

The poetic style of Williams' original play is preserved in the lines of Mrs. Venable, which makes Hepburn's scenes especially fun: Mrs. Venable could almost be an aging Blanche Dubois.  This alone makes the film worth checking out.
