Statham will blindly accept ANY script shoved into his scowling face. History shows this. In fact, he is so without a filter for quality projects that I find myself doubting that he even has an agent. Gladly, though, there are some pleasant surprises that occasionally rise to the top from amongst the stinkers. This here is one of them. So if you can violently suspend your disbelief enough to buy Tyrese as a tough guy, then check out Death Race. Please don't let the name Paul W. S. Anderson scare you away if you have been burned before by one of his prior cinematic gems. This movie is just pure fun. Don't ask yourself why Joan Allen is in it. There are no answers for you here. Just enjoy the races, the death scenes, the crazy RV "boss battle" and (for the ladies) the obligatory Statham shirtless pull-ups. The movie is essentially the Twisted Metal videogame series put on film, complete with power-ups that the drivers race over, Mario Kart style, to activate offensive or defensive bonuses. I went in with zero expectations and came out satisfied. Check it out. If you don't like this movie then you hate fun.
