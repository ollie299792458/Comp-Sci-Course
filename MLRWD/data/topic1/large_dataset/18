I know it's not really about Scuba diving, but it's sounds funny to say scuba instead of cuba. Well enought of that. The film is based on a true story. We have a young black navy boy Carl Brashear (played by cuba gooding jr), who want's to become the first black diver in the US Navy. Off course in those days (the 40's) black people where only good as cooks in the army. But Carl only had one thing in mind "I want to become MASTER DIVER" after three years he get's into the Diving School, where Navel Commander Billy Sunday (played by de Niro) is his Teacher. To start of with everyone there Hates the though of a (black person) becoming a diver, especcialy Mr. Sunday. However as the story continues and Brashear starts beating the odds and becoming the best Navy Diver the US Navy ever has had, more and more people start respecting him. Also Mr. Sunday. So he passes his exam after a long, hard and verry cold test. And becomes the first black US Navy diver, from here you must go and see the film your self. If you think the begining is great, wait until you watch until the end. :-) Further more the Sound and Picture Quality on the DVD are excellent. The extra's like the audio comment during the film and the tribute to the real Carl Brashear are also very good. For me this is a must see movie.
Sorry for my bad english at some points, that's because I am from the Netherlands.
