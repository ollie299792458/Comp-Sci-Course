I'd like to say first that going in, I really wanted to like this movie.  It being an Adam Sandler movie, I expected some laugh-out-loud scenes wrapped around a limp plotline.  But the pairing with Jack Nicholson really intrigued me, causing much  higher expectations than I might ordinarily have for an admittedly screw-ball comedy.
Well, I wasn't disappointed.  Nicholson was great in this role which allowed him to show a wider emotional range than I've ever seen him attempt before.  He's done pent-up before, he's done crazy before, he's done mischievous before, but not all in the same movie.  He deliberately left his defenses down, showing an unguarded vulnerability that makes him, well, lovable, in the same sort of way that uncle of yours is, the one who your relatives all talk about.  When was the last time you could say that about any Nicholson character?
Sandler hits the perfect notes in his portrayal of a put-upon nebbish who finds himself caught up in an alternate reality where violent people use the system to pin their misdeeds on him.  Yes, he's played this sort of part before, but this time he doesn't so much continuosly explode with temperous rage, a la Happy Gilmore, than get embroiled into the craziness that constantly surrounds him. 
Well, I got exactly what I expected: quite a few belly laughs and dead-on performances by the stars.  And surprizingly (refreshingly so?), a very well written script.  Although there is no way I would let my children under 17 see this -- some of the humor takes advantage of sexual or perverse situations that I wouldn't want to try to explain to them -- I do recommend it as a guilty pleasure for any adult.
