This movie can be regarded as the father to crouching tiger, so if you liked that movie, it's very likely you'll enjoy this one also. Swordsman is not really a martial art movie but it's more a fantasy tale. The fighting scenes are are all "fantastic" in the sense they are not "real" but based mostly on magic so don't expect true kung fu action since you'll see men (and a horse) cut in two halves by a sword at 20 meters of distance!If you don't care about these magical skills (which are much more intrusive here than in Crouching tiger) then you'll surely like it: this movie has a much more emotional involvement than other similar films and it has also a good amount of humor (it was the first time I saw Jet Li playing a not really serious character who does also funny jokes at times: usually all his roles in Western movies are simply "serious" and dramatic while in HK movies a good amount of comedy is always present for all the characters involved!) and, at the end, we even regret the evil one was killed since the character Jet Li helps, shows to be even worse than the evil they defeated.
Overall a very interesting and not trivial movie, recommended mostly to fantasy lovers than to real kung fu aficionados.
