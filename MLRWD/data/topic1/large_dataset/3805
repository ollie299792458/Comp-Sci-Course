Not only is this one of the greatest Friday The 13th movies, it's one of the greatest horror movies ever made.  
First and foremost, the opening scene is one of the greatest moments in the history of horror, as Tommy Jarvis and his friend Horace (played by Ron Palilo from "Welcome Back Kotter") drive to the graveyard.  Tommy has some unfinished business to settle with the not-so-dead Jason Voorhies.  As you might've predicted, their plan backfires and Jason comes back to life, brutally murdering Horace and then setting his sights on Tommy (they were arch rivals at this point).  Tommy flees the graveyard as quickly as he can and tries to warn the rest of the town that Jason has returned.  But of course, nobody believes him, particularly the sheriff and his deputy at the local police station.
Soon, the sheriff's daughter, Megan (what a fox), gets involved with Tommy, much to the chagrin of her father.  Jason eventually kills everyone except Tommy and Megan, and the ending is fantastic.
Great, great film!  Some vicious murder scenes in this one!
