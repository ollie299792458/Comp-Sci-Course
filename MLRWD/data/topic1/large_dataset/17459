The problem I've noticed with a lot of gangsta flicks is that the fate of the Dons are too often predicted.  That's one of the many problems that plague American Gangster.  The story is your typical run of a mill rise and fall of a major druglord (in this case Frank Lucas)- with no innovative spins on the typical story. The story is seqeunced in a manner where you can pretty much predict what's going to happen next if you watch a lot of gangsta movies. Outside of the fact that Frank Lucas implemented a set of business strategies unheard of the in the drug game, He just comes off as your typical drug dealer( one who feeds off intimidation, makes it to the top and help his relatives, and let's not forget that he has to have a dimepiece to supplement his thugged out ego). And the whole idea of him buying his mom a beautiful house gets old real fast.

Russel Crowe's role as the flawed good guy looking to build a case against Farank Lucas is uneventful at best and Denzel Washington is simply phoning it in with his role as the major don.  Another issue with the movie is the pacing is too slow to pay attention to the few little interesting parts of the movie. While the action does pick up in the last hour of the movie,  the heavy reliance on cliches brings the movie down. Had this movie been directed by Antione fuqua ( Training Day), this movie could've been worth something but if you're looking for some real entertainment within this genre check out The Wire, The Sopranos, Good Fellas, and New Jack City.
