Marathon Man is a truly thrilling film - something that most "thrillers" actually fail to achieve. In some ways it seems like a precurosr to the "Bourne" films with its far-flung locations and its one-man-against-the-system premise. If you want to sit back in your seat and be glued to the spot by a film the like of which they just don't seem to make any more then you've come to the right place. For me it's right up there with other classics of its era - Three Days Of The Condor, French Connection and Day Of The Jackal - packed with surprises and twists and turns, action and great perfromances from Hoffman, Olivier et al. And, if you've seen the film before, it wears well and is worth a return visit.

This DVD also has an excellent Making Of with interesting interviews with Bob Evans and Dustin Hoffman and William Goldman's honest take on the 'new' ending drafted on by the film-makers.

Good trivia: The little guy at the start of the film who takes the diamonds out of the bank vault was a survivor of the Hindenberg disaster and his real name, believe it or not, was Ben Dova! The actress who plays the woman who identifies Olivier's character and utters those fateful words, "Der weisse Engel!" over and over was, like her character, a survivoe of the camps.
