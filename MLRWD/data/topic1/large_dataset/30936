I bought this along with the heavy metal collection and this package clearly outshone the other.  The presentation does not make the anime series, but boy does it help the experience!  I was pleased to find a pretty transparent plastic casing that creates the design you see on the display (if you pull it off the lettering and people are on the plastic) so very creative!  When you open it is filled with fan bonuses in the form of character sheets and detailed information about each character as it pertains to the series.  Also want to note that the CDs are in  a secure casing structure so bonus points.  Again (coming from a collector), if you tend to be heavy handed and aren't that big on keeping your DVDs in the best condition possible please be careful, but I definitely feel confident in the sturdiness of this overall package for the everyday buyer.

The DVD set upon review is a dream come true for me.  I am not a military buff but as an art student it was very inspiring and educational to watch footage used to give the artists and producers insight on how to design the anime and the exchanges between voice actors on the commentary segments.  I am not well versed in Japanese but when switching it back to subs the translation appears quite faithful to what I've seen pre-licensing and I would highly recommend this set to anyone who likes collecting!  Yes, I know the advertisements can be a bit taxing, but I am willing to let that slide because of the overall presentation and extras bundled with the series I have come to love. 5/5 All the way!
