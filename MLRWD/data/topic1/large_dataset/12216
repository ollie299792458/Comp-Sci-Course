Many are aware of the evils that occurred in Cambodia, but few have a
chance to see how this developed.
The chilling genocide, which in my opinion is an example of the ultimate
manifestation and epitome of evil, is a horrifying potrayal of the
descent of a nation to the depths of human depravity.
The systematic and brutal desensitization of the killers and the
motivators, and the counterbalancing bravery and nobility of their
victims, is testimony to the continous struggles played out on this
earth.
The movie was cold, and sucked the life force out of me.  I could not,
and still cannot, comprehend how such evil came to be.  The saddest of
all was to see what became of the children of the Khmer Rouge; what
they turned into and what became of them.
It is necessary for any person living in the modern world to be aware
of such tragedies in human history.  If only to pay respect to the
innocent masses, and to better understand the nature of good and evil.
