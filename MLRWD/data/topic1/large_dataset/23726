In this movie all the characters talk with smart, witty dialogue but it is the women that steal the show. Marilyn Monroe is at her ditsiest with a severe vision problem that she won't correct by wearing her glasses. Betty Grable is sweet but a little too slick for her own good. And Lauren Bacall is shiny, sassy, and just as smart as always. All the ladies are looking for love but their only criteria is that the man must have money. The usual mayhem ensues with some notable performances by the ladies. My favorite is the scene where Betty is coming back with her friend from the mountains and he is trying to cover up the fact that he is not with his wife by taking a different route. They go over the bridge and well . . . watch how Betty makes the evening edition with a man trying desperately to hide. Marilyn picks a tricky guy trying to take advantage of her while the man she ultimately falls for David Wayne tries to figure out how someone else is living in his apartment. William Powell from Thin Man fame has a role as the suitor that Lauren Bacall is interested in. Both of them know that this is all about the money but Mr. Powell plays the gentlemen with great care even when it costs him what he wants. Funny movie with lots of sly, quick jabs and some scenes that are so well crafted that you remember them long after the movie ends.
