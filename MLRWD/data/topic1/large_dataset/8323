This movie is HILARIOUS. No movie will ever have as much replay value as this movie. Honestly. I've watched atleast 30 times.  I drink White Russians because of this movie. Buy this, watch this, live this.

These are just a few, scattered examples of its greatness:

1. The Dude: "That's a great plan, Walter. That's *&^%in' ingenious, if I understand it correctly. It's a Swiss *&^%in' watch."

2. Walter: "Nihilists! *&^% me. I mean, say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos."

3. The Dude: "She's not my special lady, she's my *&^%ing lady friend. I'm just helping her conceive."

4. Walter: "Calmer than you are."

5. Walter: "Nothing is *&^%ed here, Dude. Come on, you're being very un-Dude. They'll call back."

6. Jesus: "What is this day of rest £$%^? What's this bull£$%^? I don't *&^%in' care! It don't matter to Jesus. But you're not foolin' me, man. You might fool the *&^%s in the league office, but you don't fool Jesus. This bush league psyche-out stuff. Laughable, man - ha ha! I would have *&^%ed you in the !"£ Saturday. I *&^% you in the !"£ next Wednesday instead. Wooo! You got a date Wednesday, baby!"

7. The Dude: "*&^%in' A, man. I got a rash."

8. Donny: "I am the Walrus?"

9. Walter: "Smokey, this is not 'Nam. This is bowling. There are rules."

10. Walter: "*&^% it Dude, let's go bowling."
