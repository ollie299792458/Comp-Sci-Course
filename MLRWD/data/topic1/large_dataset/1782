The Longest Day is an exciting and mostly historicly accurate movie that will fit nicely with any WWII movie collection. It tells the invasion of Normandy from many different perspectives. It follows the American, British, German and French forces through the beach and airborn landings. The shore landings are on a massive scale with hundreds of soldiers swarming the beaches. The paratroopers perspective shows the confusion of the whole attack as the U.S. airborn divisions landed all over the countryside and were seperated from their groups. The British troops are shown at the begining of the invasion landing by glider and raiding a bridge key to the sucess of the invasion that the German forces are preparing to destroy. It then moves on the the airborn landings and the American, British, and French invasion forces landing on the beaches. The German perspective is mostly the commanders trying to make sense of the neverending stream of reports about paratroopers, allied navy, decoys, and their inability to launch their Panzer devisions because Hitler went to sleep and was not to be awaken. The name of the movie says a lot as well, as this is a very long movie (three hours), requiring the viewer to have a good attention span to watch it from beginning to end. Some of the beach landing scenes are just five or more minutes of soldiers charging up the beach with no sounds other than constant explosions and gunfire. However, the length of the movie is necessary to show the battle from all sides. This is definitely one of my favorite war movies of all time and has most of the historical facts in place.
