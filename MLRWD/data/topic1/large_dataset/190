This review wil not be helpful to other readers, but I just wanted to voice my displeasure with the repeated release of half seasons.  This is an unacceptable format and is just one little screw you that the target audience of the show (college age - 35 year old males) will put up with for awhile.  This will and has inspired resentment in friends of mine and has caused them to view recent seasons more harshly.  This is still a great show, but when half a season costs $39.99, the listed price, that means the price of a full season would be 80$.  With other shows, such as the simpsons, selling COMPLETE seasons for 20$ it makes it dificult to shell out cash for another half season of Family Guy.  The goodwill the show has built up with its hilarity won't last much longer when it continually screws its fans.  Either release full seasons or sell the half seasons at $20 or less.

In summary buy this DVD if you love Family Guy, which I do, but beware that your only getting half a season.  You may want to buy some Simpsons seasons instead and get twice the length of entertainment.
