I feel so fortunate to be one of Ira's in-person yoga practitioners.  After Ira's class, my friends and I emerge relaxed, clear-minded, and physically tired (in a beautiful way!) Now, after practicing with the DVD, all I can say is, "HURRAY!"  I'm so happy to have this instant gratification connection to the mind-calming strategies he employs while guiding our physical flows. This is a MUST-HAVE for ANYONE seeking navigation away from a busy mind, and to a place of CALM and emotional, soulful grounding.  While guiding his yoga flow, Ira draws from his extensive studies in psychology and philosophy to INSPIRE and UPLIFT his practioners.  In the DVD intro I was delighted by Ira's succinct explanation of depression and anxiety psychology. As I began the practice portion of the DVD, this facilitated an easier path to letting go any heart-heaviness I had accumulated. By continually going back to the power of the breath to SELF-HEAL, Ira's guidance provides truly therapeutic benefits. I cannot speak highly enough of a yoga instructor, nor can I more highly recommend a yoga DVD! Bravo!
