Just for the record, I'm not a huge anime fan. I'm not a manga fan either. Not that I am against either of these art genres, it's just that I never had the time or the money to dedicate to getting into them.

That being said, I've been fascinated by Golgo 13 since I played the original NES game and its sequal. To this day, my friends and I use, "I need a custom M-16, one with electric percussion and push button style" and "..." as an IM response as an inside joke.

Once a year or so, I consider getting some of the Golgo 13 books to see what it was like. I finally tried buying this movie. I've never read the books, just played the video games.

I liked this movie a lot. The weakest part was the opening credits, it looked like a bad 1980's heavy metal video combined with bad 1980's CGI. The music was also a bit cheesy. Outside of that, the artwork throughout the film was good looking and maintained aa unique style. Unlike the handful of anime films that I have seen (Akira, for example), the plot did not devolve or get super-confusing. Indeed, it was an extremely straight forwards plot. It did have a twist, but I guessed the twist fairly early on. Nevertheless, the film was still quite enjoyable. The action sequences were very well done and could be followed. The bad guys were all quite devious and did not sink to the levels of threadbare archetypes like you see in a lot of films. There were even a few scenes that I was disturbed by, which is fairly unusual and shows that the film really packed an impact that few films do.

Overall, I liked this film a lot. If you are a fan of Golgo 13, or looking to learn more about the character or the series, I recommend this film.
