I'm a huge fan of the BBC so I thought I'd give this show a try. It was definatley worth a look see. The show is pretty far fetched, they solve thousand year old mysteries, but that's what I liked about it. It's out there in the fact that things r done in such a timely manner + that they r the only people to have thought of these things. For instance in the first episode they uncover a major religious artifact. But the show is really very good. Gillian(the main character) is looking for a specific item throughout history, this same quest lead her mother to a break down that landed her in an asylum. Each episode is like a mini movie because most things r wrapped up @ the end of each episode. There r a few lingering things that r throughout the series but for the most part you  fell like each episode has a resolution. The BBC is great in the way they don't move @ a soap opera pace. Which is great considering that there r only six episodes for this series. They also have behind the scenes for each episode so u get an inside look. If u like shows that wrap things up each episode then give this a try, you won't be dissapointed.
