I am a true Madonna fan and even before Madonna made this movie, I was already hooked to the story of Eva Peron.
Although the movie itself is amazing, the visual effects, the music even how much Madonna looked like Eva and portrayed her strong character, there are so many historical incongruences, the way it was implied Eva slept her way to the top (maybe she did have affairs with notable gentlemen but she isn't the first or the last one to sleep her way, is she?), the first thing that made me shake my head was her father's funeral scene, in real life Eva was the only one who did not feel a thing about her father's dead, yet in the movie she cries and goes and kisses him. Another very  big innacuracy is the unproven fact that Eva ran away with Magaldi, the tango singer, even though it's one of the many theories on how she made it to the big city and perhaps the most accepted, but, he was not married nor he had a child.
I could go on and on and on about the many errors in the movie, rumor has it that Rice and Webber based the whole musical solely on one book, without doing any extensive reasearch about the life of Eva Peron, I read the book that they claim was the base for the whole thing and I have to say, it's the most boring book I've read and it was written by a total anti peronist.
In short, if you want to see a good musical, great scenarios, nice customs, very good music and see a great Madonna performance, EVITA will please you, however, if you are interested in the life of the real Eva, I suggest you get some of the books that are offered here, like the one by Alicia Dujovne Ortiz or the one by Marisa Navarro and even the novel Santa Evita (GREAT BOOK), they will give you a better view and you can rest assure that extensive research was done by their authors and it's not a partial view of 2 people who only write music or of an anti peronist who decided to bad mouth Evita.
