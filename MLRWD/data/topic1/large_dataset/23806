Coldplay has been greatly hailed. And for good reason. They're a beacon of non-rock in an era where rock is king for no apparent reason as most rock bands can't put together a decent album to save their life, and rely on their one radio single.
Coldplay is fantastic live. They rock all out, giving everything they have. You have to see it to believe it. Chris Martin hunched over his piano, banging out the Scientist with all his might, as if it were his own personal Rhapsody In Blue, is the very personification of emotion. The rest of them are just as awesome, with "Politik" and "Yellow" also garnering that type of hyper-emotional emotion. 
The songs here are longer than their studio versions ("Everything's Not Lost" is 4 minutes longer), and he LETS the crowd sing, not forcing the crowd to sing because he's afraid. "In My Place" is not the hardest song he has vocally, that would DEFINITELY be "Shiver", which he sings with perfect ease. He just lets the crowd sing on "In My Place" because it is and was the most iconic of all the songs off Rush Of Blood. Not the best, but still the most iconic. 
If you've ever liked Coldplay, even on the radio, this audio and video representation of them should be your christmas gift to yourself. It's just amazing.
