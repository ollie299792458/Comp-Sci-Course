Why do I love this series? It's a fast-paced comedy that NEVER slows and never dates. I've been watching this series for five years. I still find it hilarious and I'm still picking up new things I'd never noticed before.
You'll like every character but you'll soon pick your favourite. Sit back and see who you choose - it's an interesting insight into your own personality!
Edina (Mother) - Will wear anything so long as it's designer-made, even if it's two sizes too small! "You can't give my clothes to the poor! It's bad enough they have to beg for food without the added indignity of wearing last season's!"
Saffron (Edina's Daughter) - Possibly the only sane character in the entire series - or is she? "Mum, you've absolved yourself of responsibility! You live from self-induced crisis to self-induced crisis! Someone does your hair, someone does your brain, someone tells you what to wear, some tells you what to eat, then three times a week they stick a hose up your bum and flush it all out of you!"
Patsy (Edina's Best-friend) - When she's not drinking alcohol, snorting drugs, picking up young men, or spending Edina's money, she's pretending to be a Fashion Director for a magazine. "One snap of my fingers and I can raise hem lines so high that the world is your gynaecologist!"
After watching this entire collection, 'Sweetie', 'Darling' and 'Fabulous' will all be a part of your vocabulary.
