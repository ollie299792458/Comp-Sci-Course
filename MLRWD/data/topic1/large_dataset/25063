The ultimate feel good movie.  And now I can just hear you say..."aah com'on..whataya talkn'..?"  Start with Eddie Murphy as "Prince Akeem".  The portrayal shows Murphy to be one of the greatest impersonator/actors that America has ever produced.  He runs the whole gambit of emotion...amusing and funny to reflective and serious to philosophical.  He's backed up by Arsenio Hall as "Semmi"..a perfect match as a loyal friend and not far behind Eddie in the acting department.  And then there is Shari Headley portraying the love interest "Lisa McDowell"... the quintessential girl next door.. sweet and beautiful.  If you don't fall in love with her..check your pulse.  The close-ups of her are stunning.
Holy Smokes! ...then you have James Earl Jones, John Amos, Madge Sinclair, not to mention Paul Bates.
You won't want the movie to end..but when it does...you'll be smiling as you look to book a flight to "Zumunda"..ha! ha!  Oh yeah..this movie is packed with lots of surprises...so pay attention.
