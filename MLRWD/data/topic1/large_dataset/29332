While this film bears little resemblance to John W. Campbell's excellent short story, on which it is based, it stands on its own merits, and certainly does not suffer when compared to John Carpenter's remake.
The dialogue gives the film its drive and pacing, as it is the way real people speak.  We talk at the same time, and in this, it reminds me of His Girl Friday, another Hawks production.
Also, the actors gave some of the best performances of their careers.  Kenneth Tobey was excellent as Capt. Hendry.  Robert Cornthwaite as Dr. Carrington, great. (Can you spot him in War of the Worlds?)  Robert Nichols and Douglas Spencer were superb here, but wooden in This Island Earth.
The film's protagonist, James Arness, had no dialogue, but figured prominently.  He got much more to say and do in another of the genre's best films, Them!
All in all, this is my favorite sci-fi movie of all time, because of the fast-paced dialogue, and the fact that it is dated in only one way, and I won't give that away.  It is, however, a line uttered by Scotty as they fly over the station.  See if you can guess it. This, even fifty years later and minus one reason to watch the skies - the Soviet Union.  Enjoy it!
