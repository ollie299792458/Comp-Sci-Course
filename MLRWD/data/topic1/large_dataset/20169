I'm always looking for something fun and results oriented to keep me motivated. This DVD totally fits the bill on that front. It's a really interesting and different approach to a total body workout broken up into do-able 10-minute sections that completely make me "feel the burn" AND keep me interested. The instructors do a great job of explaining each exercise clearly and showing alternate moves. Core Fusion seems to be all about small muscle movements and lots of reps so you're not working with heavy weights. However, you are repeating specific exercises for a longer period than you normally would so by the time you're done with each 10-min segment you really know you put some work into that muscle group. My personal faves are the ballet inspired chair workouts (amazing for the rear-end) and the arm workouts (awesome tri/bicept routine).

If you like this one, check out Core Fusion Pilates Plus. I bought both DVDs at once and am really pleased. Pilates Plus features the same instructors but with exercises that target the abs. The fact that I not only finished this DVD, but am doing it regularly is a testament in itself as I normally can't get through a pilates workout (find them boring in many cases) and I hate working my abs. I may be imagining things but I do feel a bit tighter all around after doing these workouts for a little while. Both Core Fusion DVDs have quickly become part of my regular workout rotation.
