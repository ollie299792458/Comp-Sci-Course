Finally, FAME is on DVD!

But I hope they will realize soon an european version

with italian subtitles. I really can't wait for it,

there's a lot of FAME fans here. Sadly, I met Gene

Anthony Ray in my town, Bologna (Italy), just few months

before he died; he was singing luod and crying on a street

and he was really drunk. I was really shocked,

and I must admit that my myth was destroyed,

but at the same time I was positively surprised

to be face to face with a men that during my youth I had mythicized so much. I think I will remember that day

for all my life.

FAME is the side of USA, real or not, that we ever loved.

Compared with all the garbage, all the empty, all the

cynicism and vulgarity of today's tv, FAME is still really

fresh air. And, first of all, a little tv masterpiece

with unforgettable characters, good songs, dance and acting,

very strong and well writed screenplays and wonderful and lively

direction (and for the tv of 23 years ago I suppose it wasn't so easy to do!).

I repeat: I really hope they will do very soon an european version with italian subtitles. And, of course, at least the first three series (the most beautiful of the complete cycle and the most politically uncorrect!).
