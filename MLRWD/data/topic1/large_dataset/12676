This movie is awesome. I don't usually feel horrified at movies, but the last scene of this movie was just insane! Many people will not like this movie because it does not give you in-depth insight into these people's lives, basically all you see is what each of these persons does to others. There is no real sense of right or wrong being enforced. all judgment is left up to the person watching the movie, which is something that I found to be wonderful because i hate when someone decides for me what it right or wrong.

Now, the only downside about this movie is the fact that it looked like my cousin snuck into the theaters and copied it straight off the screen. There are parts within the movie where I had to guess what one or more characters were saying because there was just so much background noise within the film.Another downside for me,personally, was the fact that I got to see Chad Faust naked, yet by the time it sunk in thoroughly he was getting dealt with in the worst of ways. So, if any girls(like myself) get the movie for the nude scene,don't bother.
