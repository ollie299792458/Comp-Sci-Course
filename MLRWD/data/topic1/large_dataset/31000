The Dirty Dozen, I knew,  was a classic and even epic WWII movie. Yet, I only recently obtained this title on DVD and I was really surprised at how engrossing the story is. This two-disc edition has excellent additional material which really must be seen and the audio commentary is superb! Marvin makes a very memorable commanding officer destined to rank with Alec Guinness in The Bridge on the River Kwai, Harrison Ford in Force 10 From Navarone and Gregory Peck in 12 O'Clock High. The Dirty Dozen is indeed a must-see if you are a fan of WWII films.

The sequel, The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission (1985) is included on the second disc. This film started as a big-budget made-for-TV movie seemingly with a great deal of promise. However, the last third of the film disintegrated into a jumble in which I could not suspend my disbelief and I have to rate it as a failure.

Among the strange errors in this film is the use of a C-47 aircraft (the military version of the DC-3) painted with German markings in which the new Dirty Dozen fly unchallenged into NAZI occupied France. The C-47 is as American as apple pie and baseball! Even in German paint, this plane would surely have raised some suspicions. Stranger still is that a rare Junkers Ju-88 aircraft (a completely accurate type of German military aircraft to be seen on a German WWII airstrip) features prominently in this film. Why in the world didn't the filmmakers use this aircraft as the plane for the new Dirty Dozen to fly into France?! In the story there could have been a brief explanation that this was captured intact by the allies and that it would be used in the mission.

I hate it when filmmakers don't pay attention to this kind of detail and feel they can trade on the ignorance of the audience.
