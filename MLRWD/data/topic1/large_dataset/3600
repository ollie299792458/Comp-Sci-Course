This is a very strange movie to review. Most people, upon seeing it for the first time, will dismiss it as a laughable b-movie. The thing about it, is that Carpenter comes THIS close to creating a masterpiece that would rival "The Exorcist".

"Prince of Darkness", if you give it another viewing or two, you will realize how close he came to greatness. Maybe if the budget had been higher, or if the cast had been a little more 'A list'. If you have seen many Carpenter movies, you will recognize many of the faces from his other movies, including a few from "Big Trouble In Little China", which itself is not just a good bad movie; it is a GREAT bad movie. But then, it's the cheesiness and low budget feel that makes it a Carpenter project.

This is a truly scary movie because the fear comes from the ideas presented, not bogeymen jumping out of closets. It invokes the concept of Quantum Physics, that things can be 'dreamed into existence', making almost anything, including true evil, possible.

To quote an actual scientist that I heard speak a while back:  "If quantum physics doesn't scare the holy crap out of you...you don't understand quantum physics."
