An interesting concept developed through the film is that there are no mistakes in life.  The ups and downs of the character relationships ultimately guide them to their destiny...both the happy times and the sad.  I enjoyed this film for both the scenic and artistic beauty but also the deep bond of the characters.  It was nice to see relationships grow rather than stay stagnant. Looking at a couple of the deleted scenes, I would have preferred that at least one of them be left in as I think a couple elements got choppy without them.  For some, the flash backs between past and present can be confusing. Overall though I consider it a great movie when thinking about those relationships that matter from that of mother/daughter, friends like sisters, and romantic love.  I think it is one of those types of stories that you can identify with more than one of the characters by the different situations and emotions they find themselves.  It's only the smoothness of the story that I detract a star as I think there are some movies better on both character development and story telling.  I did experience a glitch in the hd dvd picture/sound during the wedding reception scene where both the picture and sound disappeared...and only the picture corrected itself.  It played through fine on the dvd side and did later on the hd dvd side as well.  I do have the latest firmware so not sure what happened the first couple times as never seen that on a disk before.
