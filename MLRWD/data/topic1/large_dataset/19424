This movie was a movie I wanted to watch.
As a Japanese, I can not rate this movie as 5 stars.
This movie is a kind of propaganda like the movie "Bowling for Columbine".
Selling dolphin meat as whale is wrong.
And covering mercury poisoning up is wrong if it is true.
But please think about killing cows, pigs, chickens for meat.
I think killing animals for meat could be cruel if killing dolphins is cruel.
and they didn't mention the history of dolphin and whale hunting in Japan.
In 19th century, Western whale hunter used to kill whales to get its oil just for fuel for the lamp, they threw whale meats and bones into sea while Japanese hunted them for food.
The dolphine is not a endangered species like the bird Toki which is in the verge of its extinction. Dolphines are braking the Ikesu where fishes are feeded by fishermen, they eat fishes fishermen feed to sell for their living.
And the dolphin population in the world's oceans continue to increase every year.
More dolphins, less fishes in Ikesu.
I think fishermen of Taiji,Japan have the right to protect their property.
If you were fishermen of Taiji, would you let dolphins eat your fishes as many as they want?
And, as described in the movie, how can dolphines commit suicide?
Is it a kind of joke?

If you watch this movie, please think of what I said.
And I think forcing Japanese to stop slaughtering dolphines is like forcing American people to stop owing guns.
As American people needs guns for protection, fishermen of Taiji must hunt dolphins to protect their property.
