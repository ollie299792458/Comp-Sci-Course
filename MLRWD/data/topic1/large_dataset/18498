Yes, CLOVERFIELD as a movie has lots of difficiences, including plot holes, too much camera bounce, sketchy acting, and a rather depressing ending.  But as the second step in a new style of filmmaking (Blair Witch Project being the first) it IS IMPRESSIVE!  After the first 20 minutes of Yuppie melodrama, the movie essentially turns into a theme-park ride.  You might not be sold on the acting, but you do feel that you're RIGHT THERE IN MANHATTAN AS THE CREATURE ATTACKS, and for me that was a new and invigorating experience.
  As videogames become ever-more realistic, I can imagine a Cloverfield-type game where you are part of the action, moving your control stick at crucial times to jump to the next building, run from the creature, etc.  This could be accomplished with present technology in the same manner as the old video-disc cartoon game "Dragon's Lair", where your joystick response at a crucial time automatically selected which video clip was played (one would show you successfully escaping, the other would show your death).  Years in the future, more powerful computers and software could allow a game with more detailed choices.
  So I won't lament Cloverfield's weaknesses.  We're seeing the birth of a new type of movie/gaming experience here...
