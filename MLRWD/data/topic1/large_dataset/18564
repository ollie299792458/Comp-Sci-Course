"I don't need to relax, all right, I just need to quit gettin' so mad all the time.  Like, f***, man.  I broke a bottle over my head once because I couldn't open it, you know.  I mean that doesn't even make any sense." - Jack Brooks

Well, Jack found his anger management and relaxation plan... he kills monsters.

I really liked this movie a lot and it reminded me of a new version of Evil Dead in a way.  There were a lot of funny moments and some pretty good performances, really.  Robert Englund did a great job in a comedic role and it was a nice change.  The script was really good and funny and the lines were, on average, delivered well by the cast.  They kept the running time down under 90 minutes, so the pacing is good and it doesn't have a chance to start seeming long.

The special effects were not the greatest ever, but they worked for what they were trying to do.  I am glad that they didn't use CGI for the monsters and I think that it helped this movie feel more like older movies.  The monster makeup, at times, looks somewhat like the monsters in "Night of the Demons," or, perhaps, "Demons."  At other times, there is a definite "Evil Dead" look.

This was a pretty well-made film and it exceeded my expectations.  I would certainly recommend it for people who liked the comedy aspect of "Evil Dead," "Evil Dead II" and "Army of Darkness," as that seems to be what they were going for with this movie.  Do I think that Jack Brooks will become the new Ash?  No, but that doesn't mean that this wasn't a very enjoyable movie.
