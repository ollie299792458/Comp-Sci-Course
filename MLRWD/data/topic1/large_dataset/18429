There are only certain "Special Editions" that I will purchase because they really seem "special."  For example, the Blade Runner box set in the suitcase.  The James Bond set - got it on Amazon for a great price and it has lots of extras.  And now, the U2 Super Deluxe Set for U2360.  This show, I believe, is the one that was broadcast over Youtube and it was amazing.  A real mix of new and old songs.  This set also comes with the tour program, as well as those fun extras that we've all come to know and love. I'm not going to rehash what's in the set.  Sure, you don't really need U2 guitar picks, but for the cost of the whole set, it's kind of fun to have.  The set is beautifully packaged and the materials are good quality.  The hardback book is kind of cool too, plus a single called "Soon."  I have not listened to it yet. But it's U2, so most likely, I'll like it.

If you're as big a fan of U2 as I am, you'll enjoy the set.  For average fans who just want to see a good show, get just the DVD. But diehards,  I don't think you'll be disappointed with this set.
