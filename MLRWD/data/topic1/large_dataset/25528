There is plenty of praise worthy of this film, "Apollo 13," directed by Ron Howard.  Not only is it surprisingly attune to the facts of the ill-fated moon mission, it still makes you care about the astronaunts who flew:  Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Jack Swaggert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton).  The film also features Gary Sinese has Ken Maddingly, the astronaut kept out of the mission.  Their woes began when an oxygen tank exploded and they had to rely their lunar lander in order to get home.  But they were aided by NASAs' impassioned crew back on the ground led by team leader Gene Kranz (Ed Harris).  Plenty of risky improvising insues to get them home, such as using socks and suits to help make an air filter and turning off their navigating computer in order to save power.
Even throughout all this tenchnical and historical clutter, director Ron Howard still keeps the filming flowing fluidly with white-knuckled scenes aboard the spacecraft.  And the production design is incredible.  Most likely modeled after the actual Saturn 5 rocket, the exquisitely detailed sets serve to give the film an added sese of realism, and isn't the truth more interesting than almost any fiction?  It should be said however that the film is also augmented by a sharp script that keeps the movie exciting as well.  However, more importantly Howard instills a tangible human element that lifts the film even higher.
