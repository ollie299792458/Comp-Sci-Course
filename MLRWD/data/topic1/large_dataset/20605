Is more reason to see this movie. I use this criteria - if the Oscars reject a movie on the awards podium, or an actor (especially non-American) chances are the movie is a good bet for the serious movie watcher. So let's  not get hung up why it did not win the Oscar - we have seen Cate Planchett,  Judy Dench, Kristin Scott Thomas, Brenda Blethyn all passed over in recent  years. You must remember for a non-American (especially in a non-English  movie) to get a Oscar nomination is an achievement in itself. Frankly  speaking, I was quite taken aback by the boldness of Fernanda Montenegro's  nomination! However, the fact that she did not win surprised me not.
If  you have to use an (award) criteria to select movies, choose the Golden  Globe awards as a more accurate pointer. The latter is yet to be held  hostage by special interest groups and big cash ad blitzes by Hollywood  movie studios. 
Instead enjoy the movie for the fine performances,  sweeping sceneries, and a dialogue that is sparse and confrontational but  so tender and caring at the same time. Maybe a bit of a melodramatic  finale, but overall a sublime movie.
I know we want to see work like this  to be veted and recognised on the world stage. But the Oscars can hardly be  crowned as the Holy Grail for recognition of achievement. Media may want us  to believe that - but come on! Most of us know better.
