This movie is a masterpiece.
1. The DVD:
Good movie transfer and sound.  Unfortunately the extras are disappointing - just one tier up from having no extras at all.  A little bit of trivia is gleaned from the 30-minute 'in-depth study' feature; the feature is simply an interview with Jim Jarmusch, Forest Whitaker, and the RZA, along with screamingly bad editing and annoying camera angles.  Not on a level with the 30-minute 'What is Brazil' which should be a model to all DVD producers.  There is also an 'isolated music score' which is interesting if you're into how the music integrates with the film.  Apart from that the extras are duds, only 1 deleted scene, no audio commentary, etc.  But the movie is a classic, so the DVD is a must-have in my opinion.
2.The movie:
A powerful tale of a man (Forest Whitaker) living the Samurai code in a modern "nameless" city.  A man who belongs to another time (or does he?).  A sort of contrast between two ancient tribes, two codes - the italian mafioso code, and the way of the samurai.  The film has been described as a fusion between many genres - samurai, urban hip-hop, gangster, and western.  This is quite a challenge, and works for most of the film (although the humor and slapstick of the gangster characters goes a little far and doesn't integrate well with the other parts of the movie).  I like the fact that Jarmusch didn't cast the 'usual suspects' for his gangster characters, but instead made an effort to use stage actors, actors that haven't been seen widely in these kinds of roles, etc.
In the end, this is one of those movies that I find myself thinking about long after having seen it.  Not only that, it has inspired me to read Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai, and Roshoman.  Jarmusch has outdone himself.  Among his work I would rate this second only to Dead Man.
