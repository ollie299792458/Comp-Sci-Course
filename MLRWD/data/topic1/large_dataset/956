I know that some people will point to "Superman" and "Batman" as good comic book adaptations; that they are, but the subsequent attempts fell flat on their face.  I believe that "Blade" paved the way for the current "comic book adaptation renaissance" that we're enjoying right now (apart from the Hulk, anyway.)
For starters, Blade stays far away from the entire "secret identity/pulling cats out of trees" cliches that are normally associated with superheroes.  Blade is dirty, Blade is nasty, and Blade isn't afraid to kill; in short, the makes the movie much better suited for modern audiences.
Another thing I like about "Blade" is that it keeps the character's origin as a backstory; it's explained, yes, but does not make up the bulk of the action.  This prevents long-time Marvel readers from being bored and gives more time to devote to the action.
I've dinged the DVD a star for a couple of reasons; first, the special effects aren't very good in some places (like when Frost regenerates his hand.)  I know the movie was made on a shoe-string, so maybe I'm being a bit unfair, but I still feel that they could have done a little better.  Also, you have to sit through commentary during the deleated scenes, which I would have preferred to have been a seperate option (at least they got rid of the original ending, though; that, in itself, would have made Blade a much worse movie.)
Great movie for vampire/horror/action movie fans.
