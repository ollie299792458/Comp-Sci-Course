I adored this movie.  Not only did it give some humor, action, and what not- but it also gave a much more realistic and historic view of the famous Robin Hood.

I was watching the History channel the night before we went to see this movie in the theaters.  I think it gave the movie sort of a prequel of what to expect along with actual historical information- whether it was on the kings, Robin Hood himself, or the weapons used.  The amount of detail that went into the movie to make sure it was as historically accurate as possible was amazing.  The construction of the bows, the shields and weapons used (my favorite part was the war hammer that Robin used near the end!) and the horses.

If you aren't interested in the historical part of RH and would rather see tons of explosions and what not- this movie may not be for you.  If you are interested in a more realistic/historic tale of Robin Hood- then I think you'll enjoy this piece.

Check out the History channel's special on Robin Hood- [...]  I think you'll come to find how amazing this movie is along with the amount of detail that was put into the weaponry and other items in the movie.
