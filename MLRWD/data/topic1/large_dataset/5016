No matter what we think about the shortcoming of Lee's films, he's certaintly taken risks and put out a body of work that attempts to be both entertaining and critically conscious. I have problems with many of his films, but Bamboolzed is without doubt Lee's best, most unoticed work. It's really too bad that this movie didn't receive the attention it should have.
If we examine the film carefully, it causes us to question the representations of African people in American media today. To what extent have those representations moved beyond the stereotypical blackface stereotypes of the early 1930s?  And to what extent do African people have an influence on these representations?
Many viewers my not like how Lee chose to resurrect and tell about blackface, ministrel show history, but in my view he wrote, directed, and produced a creative modern documentary that raises questions about contemporary flicks and WB programs like Booty Call and The Parkers.  Put these shows beside blackface ministrels and you'll get what Bamboolzed is trying to say.
