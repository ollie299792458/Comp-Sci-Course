I did not buy the series on Amazon, but I received it via Netflix.  My family enjoyed it very much, but then again they know very little about Russia.  It is quite entertaining, and touches on all the biggest topics - while making it interesting enough and exciting enough to keep watching for 3 and a half hours.  That alone gets it four stars.  A lot of the footage is fantastic - even shockingly good.  It is a History channel documentary, and it is definitely not completely accurate in every respect.  For example there is a lot of subjective emotionalism included for dramatic effect, and a lot of guessing as to what was the emotional state of mind of certain historical characters.  Sometimes events seem to be really crowded together when in fact they unraveled over a length of time, and most of the characters are very two-dimensional and the opinion of them is imposed from a very western point of view.  Very little real time is spent examining Napoleon's invasion and the aftermath, at least... less time than was spent on Narodnaya Volya and the assassination of Alexander II.  In short, this is a great documentary for everyone, but for someone who knows a lot about the History of Russia, it might be a bit lightweight.  If you are interested in the topic, it is still very worth the time spent watching it.
