I expected this movie to be more than what it turned out being, which is my own fault for watching a movie with high expectations.  Considering the cast I expected an ensemble piece on the par of 'Mixed Nuts' but unfortunatley that was not the case.  Most of the characters aside from Parker and Wilson were completely unlikeable even in their best moments, if they weren't boring they were just plain nasty.  Aside from the poor character development the movie itself lacked a cohesiveness.  Too many elements were brought into the script diverting from a central theme, leaving the viewer with a feeling of flatness at the end.

It's was especially offensive they way Diane Keaton's character was depicted with breast cancer when they showed a fake masectomey scar and as a friend and family member of women who have had cancer that depiction was offensive and unneccesary.

If you're looking for a good holiday movie about dysfunction then this isn't the one for you....only see the movie if you're really a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker and Luke Wilson because their chemistry is great together...it's really what makes the movie watchable.
