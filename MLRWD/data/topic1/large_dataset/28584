Despite the removal of the Planet Zeist crap, this movie is still not as good as the original Highlander. The worst episode ("The Zone") of the Series starring Adrian Paul was 5 times better than this movie. 
Two points on the Amazon.com review:
1. "Theatrically released in 1991 as Highlander II: The Quickening, this sequel was later reedited and gained a small but loyal following..." No way, Jose. I saw some of the TV series before I saw the movies, and sadly HL2 (original version) was the first one I saw. The original HL is MUCH better! The Highlander fandom got it's following from either the first movie or the TV series.
2. Apparently, the Amazon reviewer didn't pay close enough attention to Connery's role: "Sean Connery also reprises his role from Highlander as the Scottish Immortal named Ramirez". Ramirez was NOT Scottish, Connery himself IS; as Ramirez states in the original movie: "I'm not Spanish, I'm Egyptian!" 
If you MUST watch this movie, skip the original version all together and stick with this one. Chances are you won't be as confused.
