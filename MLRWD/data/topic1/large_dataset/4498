If you want to truly enjoy and fully appreciate THE MACHINIST (a production that I consider to be one of the best films of 2004), I would highly suggest that you track down a theatre that might happen to be showing this entertaining feature.  Christian Bale deserves an award for his outstanding performance (not to mention the physical state that he depleted himself to when taking on the role).

WARNING: Avoid reading some the earlier reviews of this film that have been submitted on this site!  The authors end up giving away far too much of the plot in their ramblings!  They should know better...how would they feel if somebody exposed so much of the plot--and the film's vital twists and turns--to them before they went to see the movie?!

But even if you know some of the details, you'll still thoroughly enjoy THE MACHINIST.  I've already seen it once (and therefore know the "secrets" that lie in its running time), but would love to see it on the big screen again...and I will most definitely be including this one in my library on the day that it finally gets released on dvd.  The film has my highest recommendation.
