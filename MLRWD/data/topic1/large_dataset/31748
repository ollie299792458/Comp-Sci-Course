My sister sent me this DVD of "Secondhand Lions" as a gift. Immediately upon viewing, it is one of my all-time favorite movies. This is first-class all the way. Osment, Caine, and DuVall absolutely sparkle. Robert DuVall should have been Oscar-nominated....and won. Brilliant performance. For that matter, Osment and Caine also should have been similarly honored. (At the risk of sounding trivial, even the farmyard resident animals are terrific performers...cute as can be! This speaks volumes about the quality and care the director and team put into this opus.). The picture and sound are first rate....wide screen AND full screen versions included, plus trailer as well as a premium quality thoughtful director's commentary. Great movies are about relationships among the characters. This wonderful family movie is one of those films. A classic. HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION! It is only because this film is of such pristine quality that I take the time to add my review to the hundreds who already have praised it. (My DVD is a single disc....the product description here says 2 discs...perhaps a typo...or packaging update.  In any event, I'd purchase without hesitation, gather the family, and enjoy!)
