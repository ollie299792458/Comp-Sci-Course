Some friends and I watched this film over a long weekend.

 The good points: the cinematography was fabulous--it is a gorgeous film to look at and I wish I could see it on the big screen. The music is also lush and perfect. The supporting actors, on the whole, were the best part of the film. Rod Stieger, Alec Guinness, Tom Courtney and Klaus Kinsi were all superb, especially Kinski--his expression as he watches the couple holding each other is up there with Chaplin in the last scene of City Lights.

 The bad: Don't expect it to be a dramatization of Pasternak's book--it is pure hollywood soap opera! Julie Christie is one of the worst actresses I have ever seen ("I'm sad....Sad...Really sad.." is still a catch phrase with us), but luckily Omar Sharif and Geraldine Chaplin balance her out. The hair and costumes are laughable--they scream 1960s. And the film could be cut by about half.

 The conclusion: fun to watch with a group of friends (with breaks!) but I don't understand why this made the AFI's list of the greatest films ever made.
