Poor George had to face 20 years of unrealistic expectations, and had a hard time telling the story he wanted to tell.  There's no possible way he could have pleased everyone, and "Land Of The Dead" has an unnecessarily bad rep among genre fans.

It's fun - from the old-style Universal Logo to the opening credits montage all the way to the end.  The world has suffered from the living dead plague for years, and what few human survivors remain live in a walled off enclave.  Within this group, a lucky few live in high rise luxury while most live on the streets a mere few blocks away from the zombie hordes.

It's implied that there are other city-state survivors, and for whatever reason a paper money economy has survived.  The survivors loot abandoned towns for supplies and a few luxuries.  One of the career looters has notions of joining the elite class, but is rebuffed; in revenge, he steals an armored truck and threatens the safety of the rich few.  Our hero is dispatched to retrieve the truck, and naturally the living dead are let in the city to wreak havoc.

The plot is outlandish, but presented seriously and supported by reasonably good acting (Robert Joy's Charlie stands out).  Dennis Hopper is over-the-top, but goes back and forth from being an executive and a thug with ease.

Of course it's gory, and it has a Romero-esque message (presented a little too "on the nose") and all the trappings of a great zombie flick.  Yes, the zombies evolve, and that has always been part of the Romero zombie arc.  (If you prefer "Dawn Of The Dead", watch that instead).

"Land" stands on its own, and like "Day Of The Dead" it will become more accessible and respected in time.
