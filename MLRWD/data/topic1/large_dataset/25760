Avid fans of Lawrence of Arabia probably won't need persuading when it comes to buying this package.  For the rest of you, let me say that the treatement given to the film is well worth the price of the set.  This is easily the most beautiful of all the video versions I've seen. (Beta and VHS versions tend to be dark and not terribly crisp. Laserdisc is far better than tape, but for me it lacks something in depth that the DVD brings out.  Nothing will ever replace seeing it on a big screen, of course.) 
The special features are truly excellent.  Those who have seen the Criterion collection laser version will have seen some of the video extras, though not all, but the DVD-ROM material is all new to me, and well worth exploring.  There is material about the film, and material on Lawrence himself and the desert campaign, making this one of the most comprehensive DVD packages I've ever seen.  The interview with Steven Spielberg, who was involved in the restoration of the film, is so good, you'll wish it was twice as long.
For those who have never seen this film, or have only seen the older version on tape, now is a chance to see it in its best possible light, short of seeing it on the big screen.  Lawrence is a monumental film, probably Lean's finest work, arguably one of the finest films ever made, with a justifiably famous score and one of the best screenplays ever written.  The effects will dazzle, even in this digitized era, and the performances are amazing.  This film made stars out of Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif, and underscored the reputations of actors such as Alec Guiness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins and Claude Raines.  It's a film about a war, an era, a legend and finally about a man who remains one of the most intriguing figures of his time.
