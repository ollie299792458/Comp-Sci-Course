Much of what Sci-Fi shows is well below average in my opinion. There are rare but great exceptions; e.g. Dune. I find that frustrating as someone who has read/watched science fiction for 50 years.

It is in that spirit that I watched Dark Kingdom on the Sci-Fi channel. Having seen the entire Wagner Ring Cycle (yes, it can be survived), I immediately looked for the pieces that made up that tragedy.

Atmospheric photography, great costuming, some odd bits of martial arts weaponry (Brunhilde used very familiar Bo staff techniques) and pretty good special effects were big wins.

Acting by Kristanna Loken, Alicia Witt and Julian Sands was quite good. Julian as the good king being slowly drawn into more evil deeds was nicely handled (a transition George Lukas can't quite manage).

Still, the whole background of the Nibelung seemed only loosely attached to the story. Same vague discussion of ghosts and their curse doesn't convey the depth of the original stories - nor the operas.

I give credit to those attempting to deal with this material and make it sensible in a relatively short period of time (go check out the times for the Wagner operas :). The dark ending is appropriate and consistent - though I'm not sure the moral lessons were apparent.

All in all - a really decent effort. Thumbs up on this one. Good fair for an evening fantasy ride - though probably not a purchase .
