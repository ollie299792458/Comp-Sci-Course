Whether you appreciate the genius of Murnau or not, the new Kino transfer is the best I've ever seen.  There is a clarity of detail I've only imagined before.  I wish the same transfer were available on Blu-Ray.  Oh well, maybe one day.

My only complaint about this version is the altogether extraneous second disc which merely includes the same transfer but with the original German title cards in place.  The set is still worth the extra money regardless.  I imagine Kino included the second disc so they could charge more for the set without getting complaints from the casual buyer about the price.  But do casual buyers purchase Kino DVDs?

If you're looking for the absolute best presentation of this landmark film, get the "Ultimate Two-Disc Edition" from Kino.  You won't be disappointed.  If you're simply looking for a decent copy of the film to watch, the Image Entertainment version is good and it includes a very informative commentary track by Lokke Heiss.  I have owned six or seven versions of this seminal film over the years and these two are the only ones I still own.
