who still hold out hope that good things come to those who wait,..and believe in romance.  This is a romantic comedy that doesn't present anything totally shocking and different, yet it is truly enjoyable as just what it is.  Some other reviewers seem to have forgotten the type of movie it is supposed to be.  Well acted, well done, and totally funny.
Jeremy Previn is great as the best friend.  And Molly Shannon also gives a very respectable performance as "Sara's" best friend.  It also did keep that subtle underlying suspense about how they would actually end up until the very end....Only after you've watched it several times, the suspense has worn off and of course you know how it ends.  I am a huge fan of John Cusak's,  I think he is not only adorable but also a good actor.  With that said, even I will admit that the ONE thing that did seem a little mushy and over the top was the single tear coming down his cheek when he sees her again in one of the final scenes.  However, to any other "movie fan" who thinks that ANYONE else could have performed this so-totally quintessential Cusak role,  I seriously have to differ....and I would maintain my position on that until that book with the phone number comes "home!"
