Tales From The Crypt:Demon Knight.  Well, it's about the beginning of time...the world was in darkness until God said "Let there be light" then according to the movie the demons that were living in the darkness were scattered as well as 7 keys that once brought back together could bring the darkness back for the demons to once again roam the Earth.  Fast forward a couple million years and here you have the demons with 6 of the 7 keys the final belonging to William Sadler's character who has been chased by the demons for the final key which contains the blood of the most holy one and those that held the key after.  The blood protects the key and any drop used repels the demons...he finds himself chased to a motel where he eventually gets surrounded by the demons and must fight them off and then the action begins.  Billy Zane plays an excellent lead demon while Jada Pinkett shines as the predecessor to William Sadler.  It is a pretty good horror flick.  Jada shows her usualy moxy and the film gives you want you want and expect...plenty of gore, blood &amp; a time or 2 to jump from your seat a little.
