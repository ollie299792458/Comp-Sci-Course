Pretty up close and personal as far as seeing "Jigsaw's" innards.  Still a lot of complicated traps and tricks.  Also some flashbacks. Watch carefully before seeing Saw 4 (Which is really, really confusing).  A lot of what happens in Saw 3 is related to Saw 4.  Not the worst of the series.  Saw 4, so far, is the hardest to figure out. Again the situations and characters in the first 3 films are all involved in Saw 4.
All in all, Saw 3 sticks to the basic premise and "gross out" pattern of the other Saw movies.  I understand there are to be six Saw films.  I suppose once they're all on DVD, the plan will be to see them all back to back.  Oh yes, the commentary track is pretty good.  It's fun to hear the way the effects were done and how the story developed.  You really need to have seen the other Saw films for this one to make sense.  Unlike Saw 4 which, even if you've seen the previous 3, is a jumble.  Still, for just the blood and guts (and the fun of knowing it's movie guts so no one is really getting hurt,) it's worth seeing.  And the HD quality makes you want to check the carpet in front of the TV for blood splatters.
For fans of the Saw series, who have seen the others, a must have.  As a stand alone film, gross, but the "plot" will be lost.
