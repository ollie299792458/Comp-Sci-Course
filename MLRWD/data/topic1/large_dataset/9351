Like a lot of Eightie's kids I grew up watching The Goonies. There's so much nostalgia in it for me. One summer I watched this movie every other day, it seems. It was on the Disney Channel, and my parents taped it, and get this: it had the deleted scenes, in their proper placement! When I heard other Goonies fans talk about the deleted octopus scene and convenience store scene, I was confused, because I always saw the movie with them in it. Weird, huh? In fact, who decided to take them out?
Anyway, there's no denying that this movie is still funny and adventure-filled without seeming too out-dated. Don't let the 1985 date fool you: it's as good and fun as the Indiana Jones movies. The special effects look great, even without fancy computer animation. Kids will stay entertained with its fast-paced story, and those of us that are older will appreciate lines like: "'1632, is that a date or something?' 'No, it's your top score on Pole Position.'" and the irony of "Mikey, I'm gonna hit you so hard, when you wake up, your clothes will be outta style!" Maybe the clothes really will be back in style someday.
The DVD release promises to be perfect for every true Goonies fan. It Includes commentary by the whole cast, those deleted scenes, and Cyndi Lauper's music video. If you're interested in a movie with good character dynamics, a Steven Spielberg story, and something that's appropriate for the whole family, you should already own this movie. If not, I'm telling you, this is first-rate family entertainment. You won't be dissappointed.
