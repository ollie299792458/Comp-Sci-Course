This is an eminently viewable movie. I
purposely avoid watchable because it's
not something thrown on for a few minutes
before heading off to work.  Arabia takes
time.  It's not an accurate biography of
T.E. Lawrence (I like the book "A Prince
of Our Disorders" for that).  Rather, it's
a well shot, well acted, engaging film.
  Is it long? Yes.  But not so long that
you can't finish it in one sitting.  Enjoy
the mastery of Lean's directing.  This is a
film that deserves a proper commentary but
unfortunately, you won't get it with this
version.  The interviews and short films
do help one understand why the work is so
popular with great directors but they need
another version with a film critic examining
and explicting the film scence by scene. But
the work can easily stand by itself.
  Notice the famous shot where Lawrence's
burning match becomes a blazing sun over the
desert.  Marvel at the optical illsions
produced by the desert and  magnified by
clever set designers(see the extra short
films and interviews for details).
  Lawrence of Arabia doesn't have the
compelling, driving plot of Bridge on the
River Kwai but the magnificence of the
cinematography and understanding of
O'Toole's portrayl are not to be missed.
As a final note, if you already have the
video and I have been preaching to the
choir than I recommend renting the DVD
before buying it.  You might decide that
the little extras are not worth your
hard-earned money; a sentiment I
respect when it comes to upgrading a
collection of music or films.
