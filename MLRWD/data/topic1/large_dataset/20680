Written by buck Henry with one of the greatest ensemble casts in movie history it's no realistic narrative about the insanity of war makes it one of the most potent ironic parodies that describe the unrealistic insanities of war.When I saw it again after a longtime I remember why Robert Altman hated the TV show M.A.S.H because the TV show itself could not be a realistic,shocking and disturbing as that back comedy was.This is another black comedy along with Dr.Strangelove and damn few others that make you laugh and re-coil from the horror of war in equal measures.Maybe ths combination is ultimately a more potent delivery vehicle for remember the insanity of war sometimes necessary to put down greater savagery (i.e. WW II) that cannot be avoided too often could if not be avoided at east nopt be made worse and depended if we just think of war as titillation("action"),musicals or video games etc etc..Again Altman was right how M.A.S.H on TV was a in a sense a liberal sanitizing of his movie and the subject matter.This movie certainly is not and the performances are great and and Alan Arkin is gives and Iconic one.Plus the novel gave us the phrase now in common use for the futility of understanding contemporary life  and how some things be they simple or complex can not be rationally explained.Find it interetsing it's not on more "best movie ever lists" given what I have posited.We remember the phrase but maybe the film was set in WWII but related to Vietnam or maybe any war at any time.
