I'm not exactly a hardcore home theater enthusiast. My gear consists mainly of mid-range items at best. However, I am also one of those people who are unable to leave well enough alone and is never satisfied with out-of-the-box settings. Having relied on the THX Optimizer to calibrate my various televisions over the years, the results were always scattershot and I find myself constantly having to make minor adjustments here and there all the time.

Enter Disney's WOW: World of Wonder disc. This is  a wonderful tool, and having spent many hours running it on my 50" Panasonic Viera 3D plasma panel and my 40" Sony Bravia LCD panel,  I have to admit they have never looked better. I am now finally able to properly adjust the color and tint thanks to the included blue gel filter (eliminating the need to purchase THX glasses). The detailed explanation on how to use the various test patterns as well as simulated images on what to expect are very welcome inclusions that make things easier for newcomers and intermediate folks alike.

Just don't bother spending your time on the beginner's introductory stuff with a badly voiced Goofy. And on that note, I have to say that the 2nd disc is a complete waste though, comprised mainly of boring nature clips. Thanks, but no thanks. However, do treat the 2nd disc as nothing more than a bonus and it should not weigh into one's decision to purchase this disc.
