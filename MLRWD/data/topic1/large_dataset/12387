"True Lies" is a fast-paced, uplifting and exciting movie. A combination of cast, script and special effects make it what I think one of the best action films ever made. Arnold Schwarzenegger is boring software man Harry Tasker to his family and friends...but living a double life as an international spy. When Harry's secret is uncovered, he suddenly finds himself fighting to save his family, the country and himself from middle-eastern terrorists. People believe in Schwarzenegger's character because of the huge "God like" status he's achieved, and that's what makes "True Lies" work so well. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the role of Harry's corporate-cloned wife excellently, giving spunk maturity and sex appeal at the same time. A great supporting cast also includes a wise-cracking Tom Arnold who plays Harry's partner (and who steals the comedy most of the time), and plenty of fresh faces that fit their parts perfectly. The movie really stands out though because of the incredible special effects and non-stop excitement that glue you to your seat. The good thing about the movie is that it has absolutely no down time. Whether it's heated conversation or adrenaline-pumping action, you're guaranteed to remember everything that happens once the movies' finished. Lots of great comedy is also mixed in with the action to let you know it's not all about violence and explosions like some of Arnold's other movies, watch for his airborne catch phrase at the end to give the Schwarzenegger movie trademark. "True Lies" is a movie I added to my collection years ago, and I recommend the same to everyone...because this is an action movie that has and will stand the test of time.
