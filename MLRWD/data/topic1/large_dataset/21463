I'm a big old classic horror sci-fi fan but never heard of this
until I saw a clip on who's line is it anyway? and had to have it!
It's a cross between Plan 9 from outer space [the grandfather in
this is the editor in Plan 9!] and Day Earth Stood Still! The story
starts off great with the ship crashing and one of the aliens is
against the others for transporting giant lobsters! to earth to
grow for food supply. He escapes and and the chase begins. The
great Ray Gun scenes where they turn people into skeletons is
priceless! The dialouge is cardboard and halarious but the fast
pace keeps it from ruining the movie. The actors aren't the worse
I've seen in other movies so it doesn't ruin the movie. The worse
part is the shadow giant lobster making some screaming chicken
sound. This part could've been left out it's so bad. The movie
ends with the hero alien destroying all the ships before landing.
It's one of my favorite bad/good movies. I will watch many times.
If you like Plan 9 like I do you will love this.
