Personally, I think people are ripping on this movie a little too harshly..
On some points I will agree, however:
Is this film as good as the original? No, it's not...But then, few sequels ever are.
Does this film borrow heavily from the original screenplay? Yes it does. However, there IS a reason why...

The synopsis on the back of the case refers to the film as "a modern reimagining of the original", so naturally there will be similarities. That being said, I suppose it's not so much "Lost Boys 2" as it is "Lost Boys Redux".
Now, I may not be as high brow as some. When I look for a vampire film, I base my decision on three factors:
1. Special Effects
2. Babe Factor (Sex)
3. Action
I really don't need a deeply engrossing script to be entertained. It's a vampire flick, how deep does it have to be? But I digress...

I really wasn't expecting too much from The Tribe... and I'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprized. For a straight to DVD release, it's not all that bad. Were there flaws? Sure.
But at least it wasn't "From Dusk Til Dawn 2(or 3)"...

All in all. I enjoyed this movie... You might too.

Now.. To all the nay-sayers:
Sure, I would have loved to see a "Lost Boys 2" film about 15-20 years ago too.
But when ya really think about it...
How bad would it have probably sucked?
