I bought the widescreen dvd of this classic family film the other day for my 4-year-old daughter.  She loves the film and requests to see it over and over.  I still feel some of the warm feelings that I had inside me nearly 30 years ago, when the film first came out in the theaters and then later on commercial television.
There are only 3 things that I find objectionable about this dvd:
1. It is *edited*!  I recall back in the 1970s-version when Wonka and one of the parents are in the boat and are talking about a candy that allows one to spit in all of the colors of the rainbow, (I think) Violet says, "spitting is such a dirty habit," while her finger is up her nose!  Then Wonka says, "I can think of a worse one..."  In this dvd, they cut out the picture of Violet with her finger up her nose.
2. Grandpa Joe has a candy bar for Charlie... How did he get it being bed-ridden for over 20 years?  Then, when Charlie wins the 5th Golden Ticket, he gets out of bed and sings and dances.  Then, later in the film, he advises Charlie to give the gobstopper to Wonka's candy rival (Mr. Slugworth).  Grandpa Joe is a very dishonest and unlikable character for lying to the family about being bed-ridden and then wanting to cash out and get the money from Slugworth for the gobstopper when they get rebuffed by Wonka.  What an unethical grandpa!
3. They take out Violet picking her nose, but they leave *in* the beheading of a chicken in that crazy tunnel that the boat travels through.  Unbelievable!  What were the editors thinking?
Does anybody know if the widescreen laserdisc has the finger still in the nose?  If so, could you let us all know? -- I would buy that copy in a heart beat.
