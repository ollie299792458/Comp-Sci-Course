I watched this movie because my daughter was watching it. What a sad story. I think all young girls at one time or another wish they could be in a magazine. Most forget about it as they pursue real careers that would satisfy them. There were two lines in the movie that really struck me,one from the actor that played the famed photographer Frances Scuvullo,who states "We use them up and throw them away"!And one from the main character Gia(Angelina Jolie) I go on go sees, I go,I go. but they don't see me aagh piece of meat. That was how she felt like a "thing".Gia should have had a parent with her. She was 17 years old when she entered the business. From the movie part Gia seemed to want her mother to stay with her and she couldn't or wouldn't, you don't really know. Also where were her friends when she began this spiral downward? Sad story about to much, too fast and no guidance.They may have called Cindy Crawford "Baby Gia" in the beginning, but had Gia the fortitude and knowledge that Cindy possessed (and Cindy Crawford was 20, still not as young as Gia was), but still young she might have been alright. Cindy Crawford has stated in numerous interviews that she is Cindy, "Cindy Crawford is the "thing", the product. She knew this and worked it to her advantage.She recalls one event where a famous actor (she never states who ,darn)saw her on a magazine had his agent get her number for a date and when he went to pick her  up he was disappointed because she was just Cindy.What a horses behind this guy must have been LOL. Gia was used,she used,manipulated and manipulating,she needed real professional help, but all she got in the end was a far to early grave.
