First off, Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunter ranked this as one of the year's 10 best films. Otherwise I wouldnt have stuck with it.

I found it to be a depressing story about a family's implosion based on several unrealistic premises. The faults with the acting and story are well described by others. Particularly disconcerting was that the still-very-hot Marisa Tomei played the wife of a very physically unappealing  Phillip Hoffman.

Riiiight.
Like that's gonna happen.

And to top it off, he cant get excited by her.
Get real.

Or is that supposed to give us some pseudo-insight into his character? Either way, it's one more barrier to believing much less caring about these characters which for me became impossible by the mid point of the movie (after an episode involving drug use).  The flashback technique tries to divert you from the realization that there is no worthwhile story here. Once the premise is established you can pretty much guess the rest- and yes, you are probably guessing right. There were several times I almost stopped watching but I kept hoping the movie would improve. I regret sticking with it all the way and have Stephen Hunter (who I usually agree with)to thank.

 In the bonus features, the producers and other personnel are tripping over themselves talking about how wonderful everyone is to work with and how important they all are and how lucky they were that Sidney Lumet picked this script out of so many others. Was this really the best that Hollywood could do? Did this story really need telling or was it more of a business decision? It seems more like the latter. But then movies are a business after all.

My recommendation is don't waste your time watching this one. But maybe you'll see it as Hunter did - as a "vivid funny black comedy". I found nothing funny in this movie but if that's what you're looking for, "In Brugges" is a better choice.
