All of us Golden Girls fans know that amazon had Season 1 listed several months as 'Unavailable' before it actually became available.  So, don't fret, Mama's Family Season One will be released on DVD.  Probably by the end of the year or the first quarter of 2007.

I have been waiting forever for this series to get a DVD release.  Especially Season One, which by far, was the best season of the series, thanks in large part to the brilliant appearances of Eunice, played by Carol Burnett. It's such a shame that her character was not written into the entire season.  Instead, we are only graced by Eunice's appearance for about a half dozen hilarious episodes.  Season One also features regular appearances by Betty White and Rue McClanahan, both of whom jumped shipped during the second season to star in one of the most successful sitcoms in history, The Golden Girls. Season 2 saw the induction of Bubba and Iola, both of whom were very funny.  But, Season One will always be the crowning season for me.  I can't wait for this to be released.  It will be great to see the non-edited shows for a change.  I'll be one of the first in line to purchase this DVD.
