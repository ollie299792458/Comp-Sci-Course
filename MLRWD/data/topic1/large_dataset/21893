October Sky is a fantastic film...it has all the elements of a great movie, but more importantly is a true "emotional experience."  In the era of teen flicks such as Scream and Cruel Intentions, it is refreshing to see a movie based in a school and with teenagers that actually look and act like teenagers.
But the most striking thing about this movie is the young man playing the lead role of Homer Hickham.  Jake Gyllenhaal deserves all the accolades for how great this movie is.  He is the rare actor who looks through the camera instead of into it. His eyes are piercing and earnest, and you really believe he's just a boy from West Virginia trying to make something of his life. (And his southern West Virginia accent is very convincing).
He is the "good" future of young Hollywood. It is clear he wants to study and become a better actor--not rest on the laurels of one good performance.  
Chris Cooper is wonderful as a father who simply doesn't understand his son's dream, while Natalie Cannerday brings just enough spunk to make Mrs. Hickham interesting.  Other notable performances include Laura Dern and relative unknown William Scott.
But make no mistake...Gyllenhaal steals the show.
