Being a young child growing up the in the 80's, I'm always up for a movie that brings back the nostalgia of that time period. Unfortunately, that can be quite hard to find at times (Remember That 80's Show?), but once in a while there is a gem (such as Hot Tub Time Machine). Since this movie was named after a popular 80s' song, and I am a fan of a lot of Topher Grace's work, I figured "Take Me Home Tonight" may be up to par at least as far as acting and music goes.

The plot is the typical plot of a loser guy pining over a girl he's had a crush on since high school, yet never had the courage to tell her. Years later, he still feels that nagging crush, and decides he has to lie about his life in order to even have a chance. This has been done in countless other movies (Can't Buy Me Love comes to mind, although the girl was in on the lie in this particular movie). However, what set this movie apart, as thought, is the acting. Topher Grace and Dan Fogler make an amazing team as best friends, and have the perfect chemistry when they interact, hitting their lines at the right moment. Throw in Anna Farris as the smart yet sarcastic sister, and you have some wonderful comedic acting going on.

The music is timed perfectly, and is placed just at the right time in the right scenes. The selection is of course, some of the most popular 80's songs that I can hear almost every weekend on those radio stations that bring you back for a night by playing old school music hour after hour, but yet I never tired of any of the songs just because they complimented the movie so well.

I don't want to tell too much about the plot of the movie, but as usual, the ending is a happy one. However, there are a lot of twists and turns throughout that actually had me guessing.

This is by far not the best comedy out there, but it's good enough for me to watch again and recommend to my friends and anyone else who wants a good laugh and to be taken down memory lane again.
