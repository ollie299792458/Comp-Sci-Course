Daredevil is yet another brilliant creation from the bulging brains of Stan Lee. As a kid, Matt Murdock witnesses his father beating up a shopkeeper, and runs away in horror. However an accident leaves radioactive waste covering Matts eyes, turning him bling but boosting the power of his remaining senses. 
He becomes more agile, more stronger but the most amazing of all is his radar sight, the ability to 'see' by using soundwaves. But that's a long story.
Daredevil is a good movie. Ben Affleck plays a brilliant superhero, and the performance Colin Farrel gives as bullseye is truly amazing. Even Stan Lee makes a very brief appearence.
But despite it's promising story, Daredevil does have it's flaws. There are certain parts of the film which make you think to yourself...
"Hey, that's just like spider-man" and other similar thoughts. It just feels like some peaces weredeliberatley ripped from Spider-man. Daredevil is a good film.
But a Spider-man beater it ain't...
