First off this is not a movie for everyone. It is filled with outrageous characters and over-the-top sets, clothes, and scenarios. This movie is an overload movie of color and action. Gary Oldman is once again the embodiment of the antagonist, but at least his villaney is filtered through a very quarky facade. Bruce willis does a great job with his steady, beaten bloody, and bruised hero who wasn't supposed to be. The 5th Element's storyline is the common, "ultimate evil is going to destroy the universe", enter hot' orange dred-locked super girl to save the day. Bruce Willis' job runs parallel to her task as they travel across the galaxy to find the weapon that can destroy the evil.

Visuals A++, Comedy A+, Story C, Character Development B, Cris Tucker defining himself as something other than a stoner on Ice Cubes hip A+++++.

If you have a quirked sense of humor and can follow the rule of 'suspension of disbelief' then this movie will rock your butt with funny and awesome. If not then leave it in the box and give it to someone who can.
