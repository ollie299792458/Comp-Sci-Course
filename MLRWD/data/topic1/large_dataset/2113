This is an exceptional film. great script, superb acting, and as they say in the commentary, "not just good editing, perfect editing." Peckinpah was a great director. Unlike most, I am not a huge fan of The Wild Bunch. My favorite Peckinpah films are Junior Bonner and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BT96DM">The Ballad of Cable Hogue</a>. Both are character studies show that Peckinpah could do drama, as well as action/violence.

Junior Bonner shares a characteristic with Downhill Racer starring Robert Redford -- both sport films seem more realistic than a documentary. They capture the truth about a sport and the athletes that compete to win. Redford and McQueen also never had better roles or acted with more subtlety.  Even if you don't care about rodeo or skiing, these films bring you into a fascinating world very unlike the way most of us live.

The DVD also has an excellent commentary that ought to be listened to by every film student or film enthusiast.
