I went to see this concert in Columbus, Ohio last year, and I have never had a more satisfying and emotional concert experience.  My only problem is my friends and I were in the cheap seats, and Simon and Garfunkle were tiny figures in the distance, though we could see them on the large monitors above the stage.  This DVD gives me the up close position I wish I could have had that night.  The sound and video quality are excellent, the songs are all part of our culture and history, and they still have the power to deliver them (Check out Art Garfunkle on Bridge Over Troubled Water).  The variations and additions to the songs were interesting and sometimes a real improvement, if that's possible.  For me, this just a chance to revisit the magic and power of that night when I was able to sing along to The Boxer along with the rest of the audience with Simon and Garfunkle listened to us with big smiles on their faces.  This CD and DVD set is a must have for the fans, and especially those of us lucky enough to have been there.
