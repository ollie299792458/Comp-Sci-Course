This movie is like It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World made by the folks who did Airplane.
The cast is excellent.  A lot of people I know saw Rowan Atkinson on the poster or commercial or whatever and thought "Mr. Bean" and that was a big turn-off for them, but his part is small and quite funny, so fear not - this is not a Mr. Bean movie (in fact his character isn't even Mr. Bean this time - he is a narcoleptic Italian traveler from Napoli).
There were such wonderful funny ideas in this movie...  It must have been fantastic for the writer, director and cast to bring them to life.  A few favorites - the family on vacation stopping to see the "Barbie Museum" only to discover that its a museum to honor the memory of Klaus Barbie, notorious Nazi...  A busload of women dressed like Lucille Ball from I Love Lucy, all in character, getting stranded in the wilderness...  Kathy Bates selling squirrels by the roadside.
The DVD extra features are neat, too.  There were some very funny scenes removed from the movie - they show many of them with an introduction to each one by the director.  There is also a "Gag Reel" that shows mistakes, ad-libbing, accidents, etc. which is quite funny.
We have a pre-teen daughter and there are few movies that the whole family can get together and watch and truly enjoy.  This was one of them - lots of laughter and enjoyment for everyone.
