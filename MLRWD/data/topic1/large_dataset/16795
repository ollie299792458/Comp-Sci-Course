About the only thing they got right was that World War Two was fought in the in a lot of water with boats. Mediocre acting aside, the historical inaccuracies were so glaring that they were an acutal distraction.

Not to go too deep; so many have already posted excellent (bad - but fitting) reviews to this movie. I'll just add a few observations as well.

* Submarines of the time did not have the capability to conduct sub to sub combat while submerged.  I think they got this confused with Hunt for Red October.

* You wouldn't see a German Destroyer alone that far from the coast.

* If we needed to break the code - I'd assume they didn't know the code - yet they knew that a German Sub was in trouble.

* The enigma machine was a good catch (which the British actually accomplished) but it was the code books that were the real key.

* German plane would have been incapable of reaching that scene.

* Etc....

For a real underwater classic, Das Boot is the only choice you need.
