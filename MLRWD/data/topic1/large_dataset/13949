After seeing the Messenger only a week after Hallmark's Joan of Arc, I think it's a testimony to the real life enigma that she could be interpreted in such very different ways- from a girl of incredible strength and courage ready to die for her faith to a woman made neurotic by circumstance and visions fueled by her faith in God despite all she had seen.  Leelee vs. Milla?  I think both women simply found a part of Joan they identified with and ran with it, though I must say, I enjoyed Leelee's portrayal more.  We got to see how Joan won the heart of the people and Leelee does it flawlessly, you don't see that in Messenger.  The Messenger skips how she got to be St. Joan in the eyes of the people.  In Leelee's Joan, I can believe she led her people to victory in battle because Leelee is so exceptional in the battle scenes while Milla seemed completely lost.  And visually, it is hard to believe this movie was made for television as it was so beautiful to look at.  Definitely worth the cost of buying.
