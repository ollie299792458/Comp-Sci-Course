Carl Rove is sarcastically referred to as "Bush's Brain", implying that Bush - by himself - is unintelligent and incapable of having his own thoughts and positions on public issues. Such a conclusion seems to be more or less supported by the facts, but this is a contentious area. The problem with this film is the fact that Carl Rove is such a vindictive, win at all costs, kick 'em while they're down, who cares who it hurts kind of guy, that this film comes off as being biased or nasty when its really not, its just factual.

This said - in my opinion, - this film tries to cover way too much in too short of a time skipping way too many important facts in the process. Regardless of which side of the fence you are on, Bush and what makes Bush the way he is, is a very complex issue that simply cannot be covered in the 80 minute run time we have here, esp. if we try to throw in the added task of explaining what makes another complicated character tick. This is a good start, but expect to watch and read more to get a complete picture.
