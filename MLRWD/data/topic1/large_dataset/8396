I got to say I was completely stubborn in reading "Eragon" for several years now.  And I finally sat down and read this book.  I enjoyed it and think that Paolini has potentially in the future with his career.  Anyway, I just recently finished "Eragon" and wanted to see the movie.  Taking out from the my local library (which was a good choice on my part). Two and a half hours later, you had a disappointed person sitting on the couch.

Where was the bond between Brom and Eragon?  What the heck Arya is an elf, you know.  Eragon was suppose to be able to fight with both hands (left and right due to an injury).  And Saphira kinda just grow up in a matter of what? 3 seconds.  I felt that the relationship was pitiful with both Saphira and Brom (yeah, I basically shrugged when he died in the movie.)  I thought Saphira's version was blue not red.  Something they should have changed if they plan to make a sequel (which I hope they don't. I have not finished the second book yet)  I felt like this movie was more like "Lord of the Rings in training" with all that random running.  Like "The Return of the King" it did not come through for the fans (at least in my opinion).  Paolini should have written or helped in the screenplay.  Maybe it would have been better, maybe.
