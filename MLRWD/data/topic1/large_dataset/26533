Stan LAUREL & Oliver HARDY one of the greatest comedy teams of ALL-TIME (a 25 plus year partnership & 105 films) finally comes to Blu-ray and in this 1934 Comedy Opera "MARCH of the WOODEN SOLDIERS (originally "BABES in TOYLAND")

TOYLAND with all your nursery rhyme characters preparing for Santa's arrival and a villian & his evil army of boogey-men, twarted by Laurel & Hardy with the assitance of WOODEN SOLDIERS. A fun filled 90 minutes of action and song!!!!!

This Christmas film is one of their funniest and a great introduction film to ALL, young and old!!!  If you have a VHS or DVD copy of this Laurel & Hardy thats great but believe me this Blu-ray version ESPECIALLY IN COLOR has been remastered from an original 35mm Black and White master.  This High-definition colorized Blu-ray movie is OUTSTANDING.  The color version compliments the Hi-Def picture. (NOTE: the black and white isn't as fantastic and more grainy.)

THE COLOR VERSIONS DETAILS ARE SO CLEAR THAT YOU CAN SEE A HANGING THREAD ON BO-PEEP's LEFT SHOE WHEN SHE AND TOM TOM ARE LOCKED IN THE STOCKS!!!  Just one example of this clarity, plus excellent colorization!!!!

This Christmas Opera Blu-ray is wonderful and loaded with many SPECIAL FEATURES like; 1.) TWO movie (blu-ray) versions to include the original black and white plus the new color version. 2.) Original Theatrical Trailer.  3.) Christmas Trailer Gallery (upcoming Christmas old movies being upgraded to blu-ray).  4.) BONUS: Blu-ray version of the Original 1951 Cartoon "Rudolph the RED NOSE REINDEER". 5.) a Laurel & Hardy color featurette.  6.) Holiday Bonus Package with 1950,s toy commercials from Mattell, IDeal, Hasbro, Remco and more. Plus Sing alongs, Night before Christmas short, Howdy Doody Christmas and much more.

This is a must have holiday package.  A family Home Theater Collectors Edition. ENJOY!!!!!
