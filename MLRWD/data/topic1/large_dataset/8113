I watched this movie last night in my room, and at 11, when it ended, I walked out, layed down on my couch and had trouble sleeping.  People say that you only like it if you're a "woe is me" teenager, but I'm not.  I hated the Ring, if anybody has read my reviews of other movies you'd know.  I don't just like artsy fartsy horror movies.  My favorite movie of all time is 'Freddy Vs. Jason', tell me that's artsy fartsy.  The video store I rented this at labeled it a drama, but I saw a preview of it, in what I think was either Cabin Fever or Leprechaun Back 2 Tha Hood, get my point?  It looked like a horror movie.  I decided to give it a go because I'll give any horror movie a chance, and afterwards I was very disturbed.  The film builds up a lot of character for everyone and my favorite was Polly.  I didn't know what would happen next in this film, and when the final half hour rolled around, I was deeply disturbed.  Mutilation, body parts, human dolls, and scoopels, LOL (Inside joke).  This movie tackles areas that I haven't seen near this bad since probably the Surgeon, another classic.  This movie is definitely worth a view and if you like payback, gore, seeing little blind kids bleed and lesbians, then this movie is for you.  Just for the record, this is the only movie I know that actually showed blind keeds crawling on glass.  The movie may be slow, but that just made me care about the characters more, especially Polly.  She's hot and a lesso.  Peace out and enjoy this film, a very good slasher/revenge/demented film, and keep checking for more reviews by me.  
P.S. most are under Snowmonfon, just for future reference.  Oh, and for those who say that we have no taste, I got something for you to taste, my foot up your @$$!  Yeah, I guess I am pretty tasteless, and I like it.
