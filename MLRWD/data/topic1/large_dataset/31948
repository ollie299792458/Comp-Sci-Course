I am 23, about to be 24, 5'8" and currently 168 lbs. When i first started working out in December, I was 180 lbs. In about a month I have dropped 10+ lbs using Jillian's DVDs, cardio and good diet. I bought several of her DVDs at once and was alternating them every week, I work out about 4-5 times a week.
I finally added the Six-week six pack into my routine this week and all I can say is AMAZING!!! THis exercise is definitely focuseson your core, but moves very fast paced so you can get a good cardio workout as well. The day after, I was feeling every single ab muscle in my body. I have noticed better posture and I naturally hold my stomach in.
If you are a beginner, definitely take this dvd at your own pace until to you get stronger. I still consider myself a beginner to intermediate ability, and the warm-up had me out of breath and panting! This workout definitely is going to work and I can't wait to see my body using all of JIllian's DVDs over the next few months(I also get in 3-4 days of cardio: spinning classes or jog around the park) Please buy  this one ladies and gents!
