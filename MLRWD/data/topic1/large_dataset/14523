This was a very short film, and I have a thing about short films. Usually being "was this worth the money I spent, the lines I stood at, and the people you encounter...all for a 90 min/short but sweet flick. Under circumstances, I would have said "this film should have been longer", however...there is no need. Phone Booth has all the elements of keeping the suspense, with a little dab of humor, Joel Schumacher pulled it off with a "bang", using film techniques that could make George Lucus weaken in the knees. And that's a huge complement on Schumacher's part, since he had killed the Batman series. I actually asked my self after the final credits rolled "Did Alfred Hitchcock come back from the dead?" It is a rumor that even the master of suspense him self, always wanted to make a film around a phone booth. I think this would make Hitch him self proud.
The film shows the morals of one's actions of stupid things they do. Even though there is no sudden impact towards the moral of this story, it does however, raise some questions of American's today. Without giving too much detail of plot, I will say that it is highly clever enough with cliche angles (yet still seems a bit fresh) to please any moviegoer.
