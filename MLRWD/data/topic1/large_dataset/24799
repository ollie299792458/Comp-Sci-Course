After watching this film, I gained so much more respect for both the movie's key actors and it's director. Mr. Washington, as always, delivers an effective and compassionate performance as well as Annette Bening and Tony Shalhoub. "The Siege" is a very effective movie that envelops you from beginning to end. It also holds some of the most shocking scenes in any recent flick that hit a little to close to home. The camera directions, editing and score all add to it's hold on the viewer and makes each and every one of us ask ourselves 'how far is too far?'

I've read reviews that claim this film is 'biased' in it's attitude as to what would happen if terrorists pushed this country so far as to declare martial law on itself. Those people don't understand this film. There is no way that this movie would have been made after 9-11. The reason? Because those films would in fact be the biased ones. This film, however just shows a 'what-if' perspective. What if The US army invaded New York and took thousands of Muslims hostages? What if the army and FBI went toe-to-toe as to what they believe is right for this country? And what if you were subject to seeing the aggravation and frustrations of American Muslims in a time of war? "The Siege" happens to be one of my favorite movies for those simple reasons.
