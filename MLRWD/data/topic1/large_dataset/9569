I was expecting a goofy Disney movie but this is much better than that.  It's the type of movie you could let your 12-16 year old girl watch knowing she's getting a few life lessons included in the cost of entertainment.

The main character Alice McKinley (Alyson Stoner) is cast as a clumsy tomboy.  Having a "normal" main character instead of a pretty popular type makes the movie much more realistic and touching.  She falls, spills, and finds herself in embarrassing situations constantly.  Most teenage girls could relate to that.  Most of the movie has you hoping her character will find happiness.  That theme is the one that dominates.

Also influencing the plot is that the whole family suffers from the death of the mother.  There are a lot of touching issues revolving around that issue.  The dad is starting to date and Alice has emotions resulting from that as well.

Alice has teacher named Mrs. Plotkins who Alice does not like at first.  Mrs. Plotkins keeps helping and through the movie you want Alice to appreciate Mrs. Plotkins too.

In summary, you can't beat a movie that young teenage girls will love and parents will not mind watching too.
