The first half hour of this movie is ridiculously slow.  I must admit that the first time I saw this movie, I was very bored at first.  And, the love story clich&eacute; is nothing original.  "Oh noes, my rockstar boyfriend is gone!!"  Seen it all before.

But, honestly, I got something much different out of this movie than most people seem to have gotten.  While other people seem to be focused on the love story, or that August is a musical prodigy, or that he is bound and determined to find his parents, or what have you, all of that seemed secondary to me.  To me, the real story is how music affects us all, no matter who we are or what kind of music we make.  August's dad is a guitarist and a rock singer who quits his music only to return later, because his life is incomplete without it.  His mother is a classically trained cellist who becomes a music teacher as well as a performer.  Wizard turns to music as a means to an end (teaching the children to play so they can make money for him) and as a source of comfort (playing the harmonica when he loses his best student).  All of the professors at Julliard are moved by the music that August creates.  Is music not the real star of this movie?  Freddie Highmore's character is just a facilitator.  Music the true star here.  Thus, I give this movie 4 stars.
