This is a great movie and a great DVD.  Like most collector's edition DVDs from Universal, this DVD has an original documentary that is just AWESOME!  It runs about 50 minutes and narrates the story of the real life Karen Blixen and how they adapted it for the movie.  It features the director, Sydney Pollack, the composer, John Barry, Meryl Streep, and a Karen Blixen biographer.  It doesn't go into much "behind the scenes" type footage (for which I'm glad) but instead tries to tell the story of Blixen, with input from the director, Meryl Streep, and the biographer.  I especially liked how many excerpts from her actual writings are narrated throughout the documentary.  There are also old photographs of Karen Blixen, the other major characters (mostly of Dennys and the people who worked on her farm), and the farm.  And amazingly, they have video footage, taken recently it seems, of the real life boy who had the injured foot she took care of!
The DVD also has a "funny" trailer full of 80s synthesizer music, some cast/crew bios, production notes, and audio commentary by Sydney Pollack.  But overall, this documentary is the real highlight of this DVD.  It is really awesome and is definitely a must have for any Out of Africa fan.
