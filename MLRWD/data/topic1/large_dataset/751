The accelerating level of greed of the Fox studios can be measured by the number of years between Aliens installments - 7 years between the first two, 6 years between the second and third, and 5 years between the third and this final (?) installments.  But I digress . . .
As with the second installment, this one has an action movie feel and a tinge of humor that you would expect from a French director.  The plot starts out as believable as any of the other films - the "Company" has taken a sample of the deceased Ripley's blood to genetically engineer a clone - Ripley + new alien queen.  From the opening credits and a later sequence, it takes the Company many, many tries - but eventually they accomplish their goal.  However, as it turns out, the new "Ripley" is 99% human/1% alien, and the new alien queen is 99% alien/1% human.  As with all the installments, there is a great ensemble cast - including Winona Rider as a rogue android, playing upon Ripley's hate/love relationship with androids from the first two films.  However, ultimately the film takes a plot turn that is all too frequent in sequels where there is a lack of creativity - too many bad guys (e.g.,'Batman & Robin' (a/k/a 'Batman On Ice').  Namely, the abrupt birth of the human-alien hybrid in the last quarter of the film comes across as quite contrived (both in terms of special effects and plot) and ultimately betrays the film, and for that matter, the franchise.
The producers could have used the genetic engineering topic to create a much more subtle, but effective, ending involving Ripley's character and divided loyalties, but they missed the opportunity.  For that matter, they could have let the original director of 'Alien 3' make the movie he wanted to make (i.e., something not done in either of the first two installments - aliens on Earth), as the first two directors were permitted to do.  In any case, 'Alien Resurrection' is nothing more than an average action/sci-fi flick.
