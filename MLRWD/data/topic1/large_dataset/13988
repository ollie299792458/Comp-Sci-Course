When Underworld first came out it was highly criticized by the critics, but being a fan of Vampire movies I decided to see it anyway.  I was really glad I ignored the critics and saw the first Underworld as it was a delightful film with a solid storyline.

Underworld Evolution struggles however with continuing where the original left off.  The film certainly benefits from the original as there are great fighting sequences, lots of action and better special effects, particularly involving the main Villain!  That's about it though.  The acting is mediocre and the storyline is a bit confusing and choppy.  While the movie was entertaining, it really didn't leave me with a 'wow' feeling or much more than the feeling that I had seen it but could have gotten by without.

The initial few scene sequences give a pretty good background to setup the story; however it's done in memory flashes that might be difficult to follow for anyone that hasn't seen the original Underworld. I highly recommend watching the original prior to seeing this film.  At times during the beginning, I had trouble understanding parts of the dream sequence and where the writers were going and I've seen the original twice, but hang in there it will make sense in the end!

While I'm ranking this movie only 3 out of 5, don't take that as a warning to stay away.  If you enjoyed the first one, odds are you'll enjoy this one too. Just don't expect it to be better than the original.  Sequels rarely are and this one follows that trend.
