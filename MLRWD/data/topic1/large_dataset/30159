I am actually a Hilary Duff fan.  I was actually really looking forward to this movie, but after discovering what this movie has to offer through reviews, I probably will never see it, not even when it comes out in rental stores or the dollar theater.

I'll give you my reasons:

1. After reading the review on www.screenit.com, I came to the conclusion that this movie should be rated PG-13 and is not really a family film.

2.  There is a gay guy cast as one of the main characters and this kind of behavior should not be endorsed.

3.  From what I've heard about this movie, it sounds bland, boring and a movie that should be skipped.

So there are my reasons.  Please save your money and don't go see this movie.  Instead, see one of Duff's other movies such as Raise Your Voice, A Cinderella Story, Cheaper By the Dozen, Cadet Kelly, or Lizzie Mcguire.  I hope that the next time Hilary Duff will not compromise and be in a movie as terrible as this one.
