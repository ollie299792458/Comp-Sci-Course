If you enjoy the Stargate SG-1 series, you will enjoy this spin-off.  Being a big fan myself, my biggest concern was that I wouldn't buy into this new look-alike cutting into the original stargate series--I was wrong.  It is almost completely detatched from the original show, has an all new bigger and badder evil race to battle and has more civilian control, which gives the characters' problem-solving strategies a new perspective.  Plus, they're in another galaxy, and the worlds are completely different!

If you've never seen Stargate before, I suggest you check it out...this show takes off at the end of season 7 on the original series.  Watching SG-1 isn't completely necessary in order to follow this show, but it would help a lot.

One thing I about the show that isn't so great is that it seems the producers have gotten a little cheaper on the special effects--the CG is pretty obvious and they use a lot of it.  However, being a TV show, I wouldn't really expect special effects on the same magnitude of major motion pictures.

Also, there's the Atlantis movie floating around...if you're buying the season 1 box set, you don't need to buy the movie.  The movie is just the pilot episode, and it's included in the set, so save your money.

Overall?  Go for it--it's worth checking out at least once!
