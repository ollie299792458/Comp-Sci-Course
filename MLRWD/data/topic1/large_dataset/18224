When I first saw this movie, I was a high school wrestler into Schwarzenegger flicks. My friends were going with their dad and invited me along. First off, I was surprised and a bit confused by the level of irony in this film. I didn't realize it was a satire. I was pulling for Barton Fink (John Turturro), a self-absorbed, arogant, childish weeneie, all the way. Not that he was evil, mind you, just a tad unrealistic. Oddly, it took a trip to Hollywood to expose him to the real world. In Hollywood he meets super sleazy two-faced execs, formerly great/currently drunk authors, and a too friendly to be true insurance salesman called Big Dan (John Goodman). Barton depends on each of these men, and they all let him down in surprising fashion. He has found himself in the proverbial world where "nothing is as it seems", and he becomes hopelessly lost.
Barton Fink is a beautifully crafted  movie from the Coen brothers, who manage to recall David Lynch, as much as anyone else save themselves, in telling this extremely peculiar and hilariously bizare story.
By the way, this may be revisionist history at work, but I credit this movie for showing me the light away from Arnold, Jean-Claude, and the like. If you like Fargo, Big Lebowski, or Blue Velvet, this is right up your alley.
