When major studios restore the classic titles in their vaults AND transfer them to disc from masters scanned in ultra-high resolution, they are demonstrating to us that they have learned from film experts and the general public that shoddy efforts at releasing these products in higher resolution formats in the recent past (DVD, now Blu-Ray) will be protested, and worse, not purchased, when news of their poor quality is emblazoned on the Net, and in Amazon reviews.  The studios now know that they must PROTECT THEIR INVESTMENT in the films whose rights they control. May they never forget this fundamental lesson. And we, the movie-loving public, have a duty to PURCHASE the initial product of these restorations, that have been so carefully, and expensively performed, in order to reward them for these efforts!
Sure, 4K is the digital approximation of chemical film resolution, and Blu-Ray currently "only" displays at 1080p native resolution on our current HDTVs. But aren't these restorations BEAUTIFUL and amazing to experience now? Support these truly loving efforts at restoration by BUYING them!
Creating this master makes it possible to transfer to still-unavailable future viewing formats with even higher resolution. Will we buy that version of the film we love, though we own the Blu-Ray today?  That is our choice to make--but I am so happy that the choice will now be possible, due to the creation of these ultra-high resolution masters!
UPDATE 7/22/12: "Singin' In the Rain" Blu Ray has been mastered from the second-generation Technicolor preservation positive which was scanned and restored in 6K (as the original negative was destroyed in the Eastman fire in 1978)
