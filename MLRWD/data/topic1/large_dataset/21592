Great Movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it and would watch it again.
It's just an observation but the negative reviews for this movie are some of the longest reviews I've ever witnessed on Amazon. Somebody went to a lot of trouble to hate this movie in intricate detail.
I must admit that I enjoy Kurt Russell's and Kevin Costner's acting style so I found this movie likable even before I watched it. I also enjoyed the comic book way the story is told. Extreme camera angles and the "music video" approach to directing was appealing to me. There is some comedy in this movie if you choose to look for the subtle humor. It's just a movie about bad people doing bad things with some Elvis thrown it for the fun of it. Before the movie was over I found myself asking my wife: "Do people this ruthless really exist?" My wife hated the movie by the way, but that's another story.
I know I'll get blasted for saying this but: If you like semi dark movies like Fargo or Raising Arizona but with a little more violence then you'll probably enjoy 3000 miles to Graceland. Elvis would certainly have been flattered or disgusted. Take your pick.
