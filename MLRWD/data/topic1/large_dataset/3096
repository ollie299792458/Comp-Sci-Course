It has been blasted by those who called it a shopping mall of scantilly clad teenagers, but to this writer it will always be a world of Wonder and a great movie.
I went to see this movie when I was a kid and it was incredible. The scantilly clad women were a big turn on to a little guy like me too !
Basically the World as we know it has fallen into a post apocolyptic computer driven world where everyone's life is directed until they reach 30. Then its the red blinking crystal and either wearing a hocking mask and a red flame uniform or learning how to do the 500K dash in a very fast time.
This movie is impressive in what it says about society and people. No matter how you arrange our lives we need change and diversity. If you try to program us from birth, our natural rebellion will always seek ways to overthrow the status quo.
A very worthwhile fantasy for those who have never seen it, and for the really cheap prices they are asking a bargain !
An all English cast reminds viewers that even though they are in post apocolyptic America, that the English may be all thats left of us ! Also sad is the apparent lack of other racial groups in the film. Perhaps it is a social commentary of movies of that time, or perhaps the producers wanted a uniform future. But to this writer, I would prefer a future that has people of all races alive and well, and I have an English background.
For those who want to enjoy a fantasy, don't take it as being a blueprint of the future.
