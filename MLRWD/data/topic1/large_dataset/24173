I have not seen Flicka and I will not see Flicka. My decision was made not just because a horse died, but because 2 horses died, and because of how they died: due to negligence. I am a horse-owner and lover. Any responsible horseowner knows not to turn a horse loose with thier lead rope attached. I was saddened and disgusted when I first read about the horse deaths in one of the horse magazines that I subscribe to. I understand that accidents happen, especially with horses as I have had my share. But, the fact that not 1 but 2 horses died due to obvious negligence and the fact that Fox tries to deny that this even happened is sickening. I will not support the product of a company that refuses to take responsibility for thier actions. It's possible that this might be a very good movie, however my ethics are more important than the entertainment value that this movie may or may not possess.

I am a real person that will receive no financial gain from asking that this movie not be supported. But don't just trust my opinions and statements. Research it for yourself.
