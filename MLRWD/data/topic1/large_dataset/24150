This is quite simply the best movie I have ever seen.  One of the best directors of our time tells the true (if dramaticized) story of a remarkable man in a remarkable time and place.  The time Lean spent  developing the environmental backdrop and the characters was well worth the  effort, as it adds a complexity and depth to the plot rarely seen in movies  today.  The desert itself provided all the "Special Effects"  necessary.  The scene at the well, early on, where Lawrence befriends his  bedou guide, only to see him killed a short time later, is a shocking, if  accurate statement of the situation in Arabia at the time.  But don't  confuse this with the plot itself, which occurs at a much higher level.  Otherwise the movie's length will get to you after a while.  It's very easy  to get lost in the details, and that's one of the lessons about humankind  you will get from this film.  Oh, did I mention that O'toole and Sharif are  at their very best in this film? (Among others...)
It is unfortunate that  the film was - had to be - as short as it was.  Lawrence as the  "Miracle Worker" seems almost superhuman, when in fact the events  that transpired did so in a slightly less awe-inspiring speed.  If you are  interested in a more accurate picture of the events, I suggest you read  "The Seven Pillars Of Wisdom", written by Lawrence himself.  (Then go back and see the movie again.) Then see "Breaker Morant"  - a comparable film, and even "Dune" - which seems to share some  of its roots with the "Lawrence" story.
If you haven't seen  this film, and you like complex stories, you're in for a real treat.
