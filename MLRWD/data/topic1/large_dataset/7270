This is basically the same exact movie as Christopher Guests' other movie "Best in Show," except it's about folk revival music instead of dog shows.  "Best in Show" was surprisingly good, actually, and I've caught myself rewatching it several times.  "A Mighty Wind" has, I swear to God, every major cast member and most of the minor cast members from "Best in Show" so it's hard to forget you're watching the same formula done over.
Both are fake documentaries that are basically remakes of "Spinal Tap" (which, of course, starred Christopher Guest as well).  This isn't such a bad thing, however.  While not quite as good as either "Spinal Tap" or "Best in Show," "A Mighty Wind" is amusing.  And the original folk music composed for the film is surprisingly good in places.  "A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow" is a hauntingly beautiful song.  Most of the other tunes are intentionally hokey or bombastic, as parodies of real folk revival music.  However, as a fan of folk revival music, I still kind of enjoyed nearly all of them!  The performances were strong and you can watch the movie for musical content alone and enjoy it on that level.
