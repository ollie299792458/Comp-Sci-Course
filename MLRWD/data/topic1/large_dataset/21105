this is a paranormal/police/character study film that will keep you guessing until the very last moment. do not miss a second of this movie! if you have to step away, put it on pause.

the acting is superb; an all star cast, headed by a supremely well crafted character played by denzel. it's filmed in and around philly, and this ups the fun in my book, since many of the locales are familiar. kind of like me watching "the 6th sense", same thing.

 everything about it is haunting, making it a sure fire halloween time movie to watch. however, because of the subject matter, not for younger children. the majority of the story will be over their heads, but the violence makes it an older teen movie.

 it's chilling, the way the scenes are built up; the moment when the heroic cop (denzel) realises this is something not covered in the police manual, that this is an event of a supernatural nature, is stunning. and scary as anything. i recommend not watching it alone!

five stars, it's a standout, in any year.
