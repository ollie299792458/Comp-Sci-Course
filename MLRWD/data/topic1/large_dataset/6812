The greatest horror film of all time and by far Universals best horror film if not film of all time. It unites its greatest star of that time Boris Karloff and its greatest director James Whale in a sequel that  surpasses the original, a rare thing with horror sequels.  Elsa Lanchester  plays a dual role in the film as mary Shelley in the prologue and "The  Monsters Mate" created by Frankenstein and the wonderfully bizarre Dr  Septimus Pretorius ( a scene stealing Ernest Thesiger ) and perhaps the  most memorable mad doctor in screen history apart from Frankenstein  himself. Karloff is excellent throughout both invoking pity and horror. The  scene with the monster and the Hermit is one of the most touching sequences  in screen history in my opinion. Only the great Karloff could carry this  off and this film goes to prove he was more than a model for Universals  make-up master Jack Pierce. This is another one of those classics that is  more than a horror film. It makes me cringe to even class it as horror  because it says so much. This was sadly James Whales last chiller and  although he only made four horror films including the original  "Frankenstein" in 1931 he was Universals greatest director. A  wonderful film what more can I say?
