Seriously, this movie is really hilarious. I like to put it in a category of "films you can't take seriously" along with movies such as "Airplane" and "Mafia." There are lots of scenes in this movie that portray things that obviously wouldn't happen in real life but it's not supposed to matter because it's there for one reason and one reason only: To Make you Laugh!!! (if you are indeed not an uptight a-hole.) If you want to know what I'm talking about, go to the scene with Mr. Denslow and the hot dog and you'll see exactly what I mean. Outside of that, however, is an undeniable sense of intelligence, wit, charisma, and loads of creativity within the minds of Stone and Parker. With this movie, Team America, and even the evolution of South Park, if you watch closely enough you should be able to sense that they're not just a bunch of idiots who write comedy about nothing, there's normally a point. In this film, the point is to poke fun at spots in contemporary America and show that it's really just become all about money, as does many things, and that it's not played for the love of the game anymore, and in this baseketball league, they do their best to not sell out and play simply for the love of the game. But, throughout the movie, they do a lot of things that really have nothing to do with that moral, but are utterly hilarious anyway so it doesn't even matter. That's what I love most about these guys and their movies and show: They seem to have fun doing whatever they're doing at all times!
