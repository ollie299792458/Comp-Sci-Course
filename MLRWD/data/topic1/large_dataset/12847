3 or 4 years ago, on a visit to San Francisco, I got up on a beautiful crisp clear morning at the crack of dawn and walked from the Market Street area, made my way up to Nob Hill, down Lombard Street, then up the steep climb of Telegraph Hill to Coit Tower.  I remember vividly looking up and seeing the flock of parrots cavorting about as they made a big racket in the trees.  It was really an amazing and unexpected sight in the middle of the city, and yet one more little piece of the mosaic that makes San Francisco such a special place.

This documentary captures the parrots and their human benefactor in great detail.  Mark Bittner is beyond just a quirky guy who happens to love these birds.  It also documents his Buddhist/zen view of himself and life and how his relationship with the birds changes his self perception and outlook.  In addition to the story about Bittner and the birds, the viewer gets to see a part of San Francisco that you might otherwise miss.

You feel the sadness when Bittner is no longer able to take care of the birds and one of the main bird characters dies shortly after.

If there's a small complaint, the film arguably occasionally suffers from a lack of pacing, but the surprise ending is great.

In case you're wondering about the flock, I can tell you that I was in San Francisco again recently, and the parrots are alive and well.  The individual bird characters may be gone, but as Bittner says in the movie much more eloquently than I can here, we're all (birds and people) drops in the river.  And the river keeps flowing.
