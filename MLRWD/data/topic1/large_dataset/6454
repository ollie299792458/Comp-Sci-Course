If you can, get a copy of the Gold Classic editions. I dont know if Disney Industries(err studios) plans to continue the line. This contained just enough extras for me! Pocahontas had one of the most beautiful scores ever composed. The story is a bit somber, however. Then life doesnt always guarantee a happy ending.

Speaking of such, now that computer generated movies are generating huge box office returns, has Disney halted its old fashioned, time tested hand drawn classics? The subtle beauty of Snow White, Pinocchio and Fantasia are timeless in my book. Theatrical re-releases would be most appropriate.  There are toddlers out there who would approve,I am sure!

As far as DVD is concerned, simple one disc presentations are priceless in my book! There is plenty of room for trailers and featurettes on the classics. Most importantly, the studio should NOT alter the classics other than improving the colors! New songs, new singers and (horrors)new sequences are unforgivable.

Maybe Disney should try to focus on a big production like it left off in the 1990s. Musical numbers, likeable heroes, and carefully hand drawn wonders would surely revive the magic!
