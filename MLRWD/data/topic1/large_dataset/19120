This film has long been a staple on the home video market going back to the days of 8MM to the current technologies.  Apparently, no original prints survived as Universal seemed to value the silver content of their product over any future historical value.  Because of this, the various prints out in the home video market have varied in content and ranged in quality between pure garbage and acceptable.

This "ultimate" edition is a vast improvement. Running nearly two hours, it seems to be the most complete version available.  While the background scratches and video noise are still present, this print is bright and well contrasted.  The image is clear and the tinting is quite pleasing.  The new score is well matched to the images.

The film is nicely supplemented with a variety of stills, some presented in 3D (two pairs of glasses are included), a segment from an earlier film featuring Chaney as a hunchback, a short film with Chaney out of make-up showing off the Cathedral set to a friend and a miniature reproduction of the original program.

Even if you have this title in your collection, this edition is a must for silent film collectors.
