First of all I have to say the idea behind the movie is quite OK. An intelligence that exists in the form of pure energy manifests itself with the help of robotics in a russian science vessel.  ...  
...It definately does NOT live from its actors. The Only character that has at least some depth is the Captain, played by Donald Sutherland. In the beginning we get to know him as a ruthless guy that would sacrifice his crew and even his life for a doubtfull cargo, then he's tempted to kill the only russian survivor to get his thirteen million Dollars of salvage for the ship. And at last he is selling himself to the extraterrestrials for the same thiteen million reasons mentioned above.
Curtis isn't giving an extraordinary performance. This Role could have been played by a dozend of other actresses. But in my oppinion this means that the role is badly written.
Baldwin...well he's there and I'm sure he was payed in the end...
The robots and the borg-like creatures on the other hand look pretty amazing and the action is pretty fast and furious at times. The special effects deserve at least 4 stars, but the acting and the story decreases this rating.
I wouldn't recomend this movie for someone who liked Alien 1, 2, 3 - He/She would be disapointed. But if you don't expect too much and if you are sick of the real good movies that you watch over and over again you can enjoy this one.
