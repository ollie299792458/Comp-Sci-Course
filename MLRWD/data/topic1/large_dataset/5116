The Killers, a group of four likeable and extremely talented guys from Las Vegas who create exceptional music ( I mean in the footsteps of the Beatles exceptional), and who are well liked, respected, revered, and have number 1 hits and fill stadiums all over the UK, EU and Australia, have made a statement in this wonderful DVD presentation of their recent concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London 2009: Yo America - we are from your country and we really rock and put on a fabulous show - look at how we filled and energized the same location that the Beatles, the Stones and so many others filled and yet you have no clue what you have in us! You do not appreciate our crafted musicianship and our concert experience. We make folks happy and dance all over the world and they know the lyrics of most of our songs and sing along in a cacophony of musical bliss!

Buy this DVD and feel the emotion, the joy, the vibrant textures of melody, harmony, electricity and energy and see the Killers, the 4 lads from the USA turn this revered hall of music in Britain upside down with joy, presence and spectacular showmanship in the likes of Brandon Flowers, the lead singer, Dave Keuning, the fantastic lead guitarist, Mark Stoermer, bassist extraordinaire and Ronnie Vannucci Jr., the most energetic and exacting drummer since Bill Bruford.

America you can finally take notice of this great band made of our own native sons who make music like it was meant to be and touching all our souls! 5 Stars
