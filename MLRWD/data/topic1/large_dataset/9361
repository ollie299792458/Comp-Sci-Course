A lot of people knocked this film for being a rip-off of current events.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  What makes this satire so amazing is that its all coming true.  For example:
1)  This movie was made BEFORE the lewinsky/clinton scandal but the details were frighteningly similar
2)  It told us the war of the future would be against dissident terrorists plotting against the US from camps in some remote country...years before we had heard of al Qaeda, 9/11, or a war in afghanistan
3)  Watching Willie Nelson leading the 9/11 Tribute to Heroes telethon in singing "God Bless America" seemed like it was a rip-off of this movie.
To many, the premise of this movie may have seemed absurd when it was released.  But each passing year reveals how closer it is to the truth than we think.  For a scary, thought-provoking satire of Hollywood and Washington, check this movie out.
If it was a 2002 film, people would say it was a clever satire.  That it was made in 1997 qualifies it as an absolute classic.
