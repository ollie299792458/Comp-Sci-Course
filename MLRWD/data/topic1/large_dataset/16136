This movie rocks!! i love Woody Harrelson, hes always been one of my favorite actors so i was so glad to see him in this role.

Jesse Engleberg (i know im spelling it wrong) was ok

Emma Stone was HOT AS HELL, oh my god

Abiligail Breslin, whatever, she was ok.

I just wish they would have concentrated more on zombie killing and maybe alittle more gore, but thats ok...it wasn't meant to be a horror flick and less focus on the attraction between Jesse and Emmas characters. Oh yeah and the cameo with....maybe i shouldnt tell...oh god, it was BILL MURRAY (like everyone doesnt know already know) was okay but it kinda dragged out while they were in his house.

All in all, it was a fun movie and i really love the "RULE #1" thing going on in the movie....AWESOME!!

The intro scenes and the blaring of Metllica make the intro one of the coolest intros to a movie i have ever seen.

Part 2 is suppossed to be coming out in 2011 sometime, so i really pray to god they don't mess up the original with a stupid sequel.
