The movie was cast perfectly. It was if the script was tailor-made for each character's actor. The swashbuckling Robin Hood (Errol Flynn), the beautiful Maid Marian (Olivia de Havilland), the evil Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone), and the tyrannical Prince John (Claude Rains). Veteran character actors are abundant and wonderful in this picture. Alan Hale (Little John), Eugene Pallette (Friar Tuck), and Una O'Connor (Bess) stand out in their performances.

The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene. The viewer is constantly entertained and never bored. The action sequences are outstanding. The climatic sword fight between Flynn and Rathbone was choreographed exceptionally. Both actors were well-skilled swordsmen which added to the realism of the fight.

No CGI here! Those wonderful scenes with large crowds are real costumed extras. The sets are story-like in appearance. This was a $2 million budgeted movie (a record for the industry at that time) and it showed in the overall quality of this picture.

The Technicolor process was vivid and visually stunning. The score written by Erich Wolfgang Korngold was classic.

This was one of the most well made and entertaining movies of all-time.
