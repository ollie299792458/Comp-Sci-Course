Fire is a very classy movie.  Deepa Mehta has directed a touching, sensual, exotic (for those of us in the West) and controversial film that is, without a doubt, one of the best lesbian love stories ever filmed.  But it's more than that.  It's a story about the plight of women in a deeply sexist and repressive Indian society.  Two beautiful women - Shabana Azmi as Radha and the stunning Nandita Das as the young Sita - meet and bond over their loveless marriages.  That they also fall in love, become lovers and have the courage to break free of their cultural chains proved extremely confronting for many Indian men on the film's release.  Violent demonstrations and death threats against the director followed.

Perhaps if the movie were not so powerful, it wouldn't have been so threatening.  Then again, the mere idea of women who do not need men is still revolutionary in many countries.  For those of us in more liberal societies, the film is quite an education in a culture rife with conflict between traditional attitudes and contemporary behaviour.  The acting is excellent, the humour unexpected, the spirit of these women exhilarating.  I've watched Fire many times over the 14 years since its release, and it doesn't date.  This is one to treasure.

If you love Fire like I do, Nandita Das is just as charming in Earth, another of the films in Mehta's Elements trilogy - about the partition of India and Pakistan.  She's an outstanding find, and Deepa Mehta is one classy filmmaker.
