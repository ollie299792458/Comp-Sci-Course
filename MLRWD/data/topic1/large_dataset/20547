People who are more geared towards plot and pacing probably won't enjoy this movie, as it is a "mood piece" which does not, when you step back and take a hard look at it, have much to offer in the way of a plot.  But if you're in the mood for some shivers, you'll enjoy it.  The atmosphere is well set, lent extra creepiness by the soundtrack by Tomandandy (The end credits song, "Half Light," is especially haunting).  I would never have thought that the sight of Debra Messing -- now of "Will and Grace" fame -- could send a chill down my spine, but in this movie they pull it off.  If, like me, you love the questions more than the answers, this is a movie for you.

MINOR SPOILER:

I'm also very fond of "subtle business" in scary movies, and there's a beaut in this one.  Keep an eye on Richard Gere's reflection in the door mirror; shortly after he burns his hand on the tea kettle, if I remember correctly.  If you've already seen this movie, I bet you missed it -- look again.
