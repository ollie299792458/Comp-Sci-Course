''End of the Spear''is a movie that should bring shame to all good people. The movie bluntly repeats the story that has happened for ages and ages. It promotes (U.S.) Christian views at the expense of the values and beliefs of a native people (in this case the Huaorani). An unknown and beautiful people have now been stigmatized through this movie to be a ruthless killing tribe of primitives whereas the Christian missionaries in the movie are depicted as angels with all-American beliefs. The Huaorani, while protective of their ancestral lands, have never been an utterly aggressive tribe. Haven't we learned from our countless examples from the history books (at least those that reveal the truth) that when a Western civilization meets a natural people they usually end up dominating them without respect for their own values (I refer to the countless North American native peoples that have been subdued through ages of white (Christian) domination for example)?
The Huaorani are their own civilization adapted to living in the central part of the Ecuadorian Amazon, why did the missionaries have to come in at all? People should learn to respect that there are, and always will be, different religions, races and belief systems and that homogenization of these is not to be wished for.
So, cinematographic characteristics aside, this movie should be remade with historical accuracy in mind. It would look very different!
