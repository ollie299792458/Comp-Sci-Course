This is a very moving story.The format is an interview of Paul by his daughter Mary about Wings the band. It's really the love story of Paul and Linda and it moved me to tears. I am a Paul McCartney fan and I also admired Linda. In 1976 I attended the 2nd night of the lst US Wings tour and was blown away by the performance. Wings was so tight, you just could not believe it was (only) their 2nd night out! I was close to the stage (those were the days-huh?) and the music was amazing. Anyone who thought that Paul needed The Beatles to continue his career was wrong. I found the Wings concert so much more fun than The Beatles concert I attended. Paul's acoustic performance of "Black Bird" and "Yesterday" had the concert hall in complete silence. It was magical. The Wingspan DVD is so full of warmth, music and a real joy to watch.It was a great band and a great love story. After all, how many of us could be in a band full time,raise your children,write, record,and have a successful marriage at the same time? Not many. After watching this, you will be amazed at their life, devotion, creativity,family, etc. And when Wings music comes on the radio you'll have a whole new respect for Sir Paul.
