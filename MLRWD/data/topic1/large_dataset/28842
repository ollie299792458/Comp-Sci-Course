Tarantino has been known for his outlandish,and sometimes childish style of film-making, but it all pays off in this 1992 classic, starring an all-star cast (Keitel, Roth, Penn), and having a plot so simple its brilliant.

The story is simply a group of diamond thieves, who after getting ratted out to the police by one of their own, meet up at a warehouse to figure out which one of them is the traitor. What makes this task more complicated is the fact that even though the thieves think they know everything about each of others, Joe, the leader behind the hiest, has created color-coded nicknames (Mr. Pink, Mr. Orange)for each of them, blocking even their idenities to each other.

Throughout the movie, as we find out more about each character through cleverly placed flashbacks, the truth becomes clear,and has an ending so quick, you have to do a double-take.

From raving on "Like a Virgin," to the infamous torture scene that makes even the toughest of people squirm in their seats, this movie is jam-packed with tons of rememberable moments, smartly crafted by the great Quentin Tarantino. This is why I give it 5 stars. Any movie with a long-lasting impact in the human psyche deserves a place at the top.
