In the scene where Eastwood is asleep and the turntable is playing, I became aware of this after watching for about the 18th time:  the song playing is Misty, and you can bet Dave didn't put it on.  The sudden awareness of this creeped me out, and I've seen this more times than just about anyone.

I love this movie, even if the styles are a bit dated.  Eastwood's characters are his usual amoral characters; there are no really good people, and the severely flawed ones still have something that resonates.  Dave isn't a good boy, but he really doesn't deserve what he gets, either.  Evelyn is mad, but she sort of gets taken advantage of, but she kind of asks for it.  No one is in the clear.  The photography is really good in places, even if the on-the-cheap day-for-night scenes in places are a bit hard to overlook.

Eastwood uses the "music video" montage and the jazz festival scenes to relieve tension in the movie before building it again.  The former shows how much he really cares about Tobie, while the latter slips in the reference to Annabel, without you really noticing.  The ending was a bit off-kilter, but I suppose to drag it out and make the ending something spectacular would've been unrealistic, just like what I DIDN'T like about Fatal Attraction.  The irony at the end (in the demo recording he left running) was enough, I think, and a good way to end it.

Someone I know had his girlfriend slit her wrists in angst.  I haven't been able to get him to watch this movie, but I'd love to see his reaction to this.  Any guy who's ever had a woman obsessed with him would find this movie hits really close to home, I would suspect.  A top-notch thriller, well constructed and well executed.
