"Submited for your aproval" we can find here in these vol 2 :

4 gems of the old show.

Nightmare at 20.000 feets, probably one of mst revered and beloved episodes of twilighT, and the most parodied, (in the simpsons  treehouse of  horror No 8, Johny Bravo, & Tiny Toons i thinks ..and of course the 80's version movie  with John Lightowsegment

The others episodes are interesting for example Burgues Merdith performance  in "Time enought at last", when i was child and i watched in 1983 the movie Twilight zone, I heard the dialogue between Dan Akroyd & Albert Brooks in the car  about favorite episodes and this is one...

I remember when i read another review of the 1st seasen where is included originally this chapter  t  " The monster are due on maple street" with Claude adkins ( Aldo in planet of the apes last movie  / & Sherrif Lobo).. that the aliens that appears in "monsters" were the inspiration  behind Kang and the other alien from the Simpsons show.

The other episode about another nightmare with planes  that have all the pasengers who travelled around time is interesting

Unfortunaly doesnt have subtittles

see Ya.
