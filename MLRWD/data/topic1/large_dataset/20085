I wasn't sure what to expect with a blu ray movie from the early 80s and the reviews on this one I've read have been mixed. Would the picture be any better? Would there be improvement over DVD? I was pleasantly surprised when I watched the blu ray. True some of the sequences are still grainy (partially intentional on the part of the filmakers) but I could absolutely see an improvement over the DVD version. Though most of the movie takes place at night, I was able to see much more detail than I had before (which is saying alot because I'm a huge Terminator fan!) I would have much preferred the film be cleaned up and spruced up more, but my conclusion is that the blu ray is definitely better than the DVDs. My only real disappointment with the disc were the special features. Aren't blu rays supposed to have this massive storage capacity and room for hours upon hours of additional material??? So why are we left with nothing new on The Terminator?? Same deleted scenes, same interview with Arnold and Jim Cameron, and the same special effects featurette as the special edition DVD. Bummer.......
