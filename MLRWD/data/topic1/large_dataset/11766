When this film came out in 1976, critical reaction was strongly negative. Only one writer I can recall -- Penelope Gilliatt in the New Yorker magazine -- had the insight to see beyond the general weirdness, focusing on the title character's increasing paranoia and alienation. The film could be seen, ultimately, about a man being divorced from his home country, from his friends, from his identity -- even from his gender.

The unnerving plot gets underway when a man named Trelkovsky, played disarmingly by Polanski, moves into a creepy Parisian apartment building, occupying a flat in which the previous tenant committed suicide. Trelkovsky gradually grows suspicious that some of his disgruntled, crabby neighbors would like to see him do the same thing. Part of the unsettling nature of this film is created by the director's skill in methodically escalating the plot, bit by excruciating bit.

In addition to Polanski, the outstanding cast includes Melvyn Douglas, Jo Van Fleet, Shelley Winters and Isabelle Adjani, all seemingly having a great time with a story that is mesmerizing, but granted, may be just too exasperatingly strange for some.  The high production values include gorgeous, moody photography by the great Sven Nykvist (who often photographed for Ingmar Bergman), and an appropriately eerie score by Philippe Sarde. The DVD transfer is beautifully clear.

And then we come to the bizarre, shocking last half-hour or so, and without giving away any of the details, suffice to say that it shows Polanski in a way that few have seen him. For all the attention that "Chinatown" gave this director in 1974, this film, coming two years later, is just as striking in a completely different vein.
