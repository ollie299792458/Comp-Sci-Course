Yes, the penguins were great as everyone says, but the lemur king and his sidekick along with their "move it, move it" song was a concoction of pure, delightful genius--an unexpected bonus ingredient of sheer unadulterated fun. The humor in this movie works as well, if not moreso, on the adult level as it will for your children. And if you aren't uncontrollably compelled to get up and dance with your children during the "move it, move it" song in all the wildest fashions that feels free, then you're not human. Great fun, but unfortunately, on second viewing on the DVD, I knew the jokes coming and it didn't have the effect on me that some great comedies do--that they get funnier on each viewing--but I bought the DVD for my six year old daughter, not for myself, and she enjoys it just as much as the first time, and the dancing we do together, oh wow! that wild family dancing in the living room!--nothing beats that in the whole world! We got the soundtrack as well. We like to  move it, move it!
