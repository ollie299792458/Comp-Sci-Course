I've watched this film at least 8 times (Bad Timing indeed!) at the cinema in the 80's, and have just acquired it on DVD.  From the very first scene, which takes place in the Klimpt Museum in Vienna, the movie is dazzling.  Dazzling for the colours, the locations, the indoor scenes (particularly Milena's appartment which is a kaleidoscopic pigsty!), the hospital theatre where Milena undergoes a tracheotomy (avert your eyes if you're squeamish).
The choice of actors is perfect. Theresa Russell makes a beautiful, sluttish and tenderly appealing bipolar victim.  Art Garfunkel (no, he doesn't sing in the film) is an ideal choice for the control-freak, split-personality, necrophiliac psychoanalyst.  At times a bullying, lustful, selfish lover, at other times a vulnerable, insecure middle-aged man in love with a girl whom he cannot mould to what he desires, namely his very own possession.
It has been said that the choice of Garfunkel for this character is a surprising one, that he is "a cold fish" and "bland"....but Dr. Alex Linden IS a bland, cold fish on the surface.  Just as the singer Garfunkel appears to be a sweet, angelic-faced person but underneath there seems to be a blazing, sexual fire.  How else can you explain why an actor would so daringly appear in such erotic scenes....Erotic? I would say, bordering on the pornographic. Intriguing!
