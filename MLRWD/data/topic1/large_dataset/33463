After many years, Neve Campbell has succeeded in realizing a dream to create a movie about the life of a ballet company, and her collaborative effort with Robert Altman turned out just fantastic.  It's not really a documentary, and not really a performance DVD, but "The Company" incorporates features of both, tying together many vignettes involving practice, performance, and the personal lives of dancers to create a great ballet watching experience.

Ms. Campbell, a trained ballet dancer starting at the age of 6, worked very hard to get herself "ready for prime time" (in many ways) as a member of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago corps.  Yes, it's the actual Joffrey company, and you get to see many cast members from numerous personal and performance perspectives.  Mr. Altman's directing features high definition film, plus viewing angles of dance routines that only a director of his caliber could imagine.  Artistic Director Gerald Arpino is incarnated into Alberto Antonelli, played by Malcolm McDowell, who is in great form and incorporates some of Mr. Arpino's mannerisms and commentary into the director's persona.  Aside from the credited actors, the Joffrey dancers are the true stars, and I found every aspect of the dance lifestyle to be fascinating.

The DVD extras are also excellent.  The commentary feature has both Mr. Altman and Ms. Campbell, so you get to learn about all that evolved to make this movie happen.  The extended dance scenes are great, and there's a feature where you can watch just the dance aspects of the film grouped together in one sequence.
