Ok, there are other reviews here that tell you what this movie is about, so I will not repeat them. This is fine movie making, the cinematography is breath taken and the acting well done. Ok, the psycho swords man in white may have been a little over the top- but did you see the prison cell he was in, I think I would be a nut case after being locked up in there myself. This is a Japanese sword flick, so you have to expect arterial spray, and a warrior that can slay a army. It is part of their culture to believe that a sword in the hands of a true master is unstoppable combination. Like one guy with a gun can stop a whole gang, is here in the states. The actress playing Azumi is beautiful and plays her part well. I like that they showed that the warriors had to be pushed to kill the first time. Any drill Sargent will tell you it is easy to train a soldier to kill, but it doesn't mean he will not freeze the first time he really has to do it. An assassin that questions if a target needs to die, and why is more real. Blindly excepting orders is no excuse but psych 101 tells us most people will follow authority figures, or even the crowed. The movie Azumi is worth seeing and enjoying more than once.
