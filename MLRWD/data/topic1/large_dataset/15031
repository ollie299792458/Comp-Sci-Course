If you're lukewarm about 24 or a casual fan, you may or may not enjoy this.  If you're a diehard 24 fan, this is a must have for your collection.

The DVD features are absolutely worth it.  You get both the broadcast version and an extended edition, plus commentary with Kiefer, the director and the screenwriter.  There's a boatload of extras on top of that.

There was plenty of cheese and action flick camp, but at its heart this is a sincere look into the kind of psychological impact and moral ambiguity that men like Jack Bauer have to deal with as a result of their chosen profession.  Is it exaggerated for dramatic effect?  Of course.  But make no mistake that there really are men in this world who make the kind of choices these guys make, and suffer for fulfilling their duty.

As a prequel, this is a fantastic set-up to Season 7.  Overall I felt this was a beautiful insight into Jack's character, something the show normally doesn't have time to do.  It was also a heart-wrenching look at the reality of child soldiers.  The DVD includes a special about that topic and talks about ways you can help.

If you love 24, buy this DVD.  You won't regret it at all.
