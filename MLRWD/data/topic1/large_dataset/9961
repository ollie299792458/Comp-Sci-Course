This movie looks and sounds great.  There are quite a few funny moments and it is nice to have the returning cast from Emperor's New Groove.  Although the storline feels more like three TV episodes tied together, overall this is a decent outing and should definitely be enjoyed by anyone who that Kronk stole the show in Emperor's New Groove.

The movie and menus are presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen. And from the get-go the whole DVD looks great.  The DVD main menu is animated with Kronk running around the kitchen while the redheaded waitress presents the navigational options on an order pad.  Besides an animated transition, the submenus are static although I dare say really well designed and quite beautiful.  The sound design and animation really tie together nicely and really give a sense of Kronk's urgency that is apparent in the film.  There are two easter eggs on the main menu that are definitely worth checking out.  This is such a great touch to the usual boring menus that so many other titles receive.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone with young kids.  And the parents will at least get a kick out of all the inside jokes and puns.
