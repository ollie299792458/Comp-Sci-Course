First off, let me say that I watched this movie having only heard 2 opinions of it. One was negative, the other "meh." So I wasn't expecting much.
That said, it was better than I expected, but still very lackluster. But I'll start with the positives-

-Christian Bale is VERY good in this movie. His accent is not present at all, which is a change from most of the movies in which he plays an American. Even though the character is deplorable and mostly unlikeable, you find yourself on his side for most of the movie. That's hard to pull off in a film, but I give credit to Bale and not the writing.
-Mike Alonzo does a very good job as the hapless straight man to Bale's insane man. And Alonzo is a very underrated actor.
-Some moments were laugh out loud funny, while others were genuinely emotional.

Now on to the negative-

-This film has terrible pacing. Scenes do not flow organically at all. It will jump from wacky hijinks to murder in 3 seconds, and some scenes just end abruptly before they feel complete.
-The plot is thin. As in it barely exists. The story feels like it's the last chapter of a book, but we never got to read the rest of it before we got there.
-Some of the dialog is so bad it makes me cringe.
-Bale and Alonzo carried the movie, completely.

If you like Training Day more than a lot, you'll like this. If not, just skip it.
