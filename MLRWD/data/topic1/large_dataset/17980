Having seen and liked the theatrical version in the theatre, I did have some questions about why some aspects of the story line were given such short shrift. Now with the release of the Blu Ray version that has the entire film included (thirty minutes were cut from the theatrical), all of my reservations have been eradicated. The incomplete story lines were completed.

A classic tale of being a product of one's environment, this film looks deeply and profoundly into the difficulty of extricating oneself out of the only world one knows, and Afflect does a superb job throughout the film of expressing the angst and frustration of being implanted at birth into a hell hole. It's done well, and none of those restraining forces that typically keep residents glued to the place they are born into are neglected, with friends, indebtedness, women, and tradition combining to keep the would be self reformer from accomplishing his life change efforts.

Filmed in the area depicted, they get the tone of Charlestown right. This is a fine film made only better with the Blu Ray extended version, which is the one that should be seen. Five stars!!!!
