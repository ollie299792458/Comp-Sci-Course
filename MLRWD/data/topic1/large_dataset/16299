Even if I set aside how "junior high" these movies are, that's right, not high school, junior high... I still can't get over the lack of entertainment value this film provides. The first movie introduced the characters, had some drama, action and a conclusion while still leaving the door open for part 2 which was obvious since they're based on the books.

The middle story is probably the worst middle story I've seen. Middle stories can be great, you can go anywhere with them and you can place your protagonist into very challenging situations knowing you have a whole other movie to them out. In this movie we followed a few different characters not really being clear who the protagonist was. This can work in smart movies but in lowbrow stuff like this it just comes off as teenage politics. So the movie had a lot of talking and forced drama and then it ends. The movie could have been 20 minutes and directly rolled into the other two stories.

In conclusion the movie is boring. Although the first movie had many of the same teenage cheesy plots, it at least had entertainment value. Watch the synopsis on youtube and skip this one.
