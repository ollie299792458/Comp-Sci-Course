This movie is old fashioned. At the cinema every other movie goer was a woman a so I was glad to be with my wife. (the term chick-flick (lol) has already been used in this review section! - but it is interesting that guys are watching too)

Call it a tearjerker but movies like this are so rare these days it is very refreshing!

This movie captures the heart and truly amazes. I had no expectations when I went to see it. The movie opening credits were a bore, but, I got hooked pretty easily after that.

The story is a best-seller so it stands to reason that the movie can tell a good story too. Must see, don't listen to anyone that says not to watch it, they are pulling the wool over your eyes.

What I liked about this movie (the story really, but the movie production was fine and well shot and casted) is that the story was unpredictable. Most films these days are very poor in this department. I enjoyed it and it touches the heart! Great for couples, chicks (lol) and guys who want to enjoy a good movie. (Don't expect to get into it straight away, it takes a little time.)
