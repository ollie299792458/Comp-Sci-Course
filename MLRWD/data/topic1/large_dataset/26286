Robert De Niro's directorial debut is a great movie and very under rated. The man has proved himself a genius in the acting field and in this film shows his talent in film making.
Great cast and awesome soundtrack.
A touching story showing life in the bronx from both the point of view of the working man and from that of the criminals who live the good life.
The story deals with the issues of the honest life vs the criminal world and gives an insight into the rough world of the Bronx in an era when it was cut off from most of New York.
Chazz Palminteri gives a wonderful portrayal of Mob boss Sonny, both likeable and at times chilling. You find yourself caught between liking him and fearing him and this aspect comes into the story which involves the son of a working class man befriending a mob boss and being torn between the worlds of his two role models.
The sub plot involves love between races and the tension between the African and the Italian Bronxites.
A fine movie which makes my top films of all time.
