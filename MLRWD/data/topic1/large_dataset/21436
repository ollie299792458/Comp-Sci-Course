Having a close friend who is from England, I have been somewhat drawn to English humor as it reminds me of my friends across the pond.  I caught an episode of Little Britain late night on BBC America and thought it had potential.  Since I didn't have BBC America at my apartment I decided to spend the money in hopes that the dvd was funny.  Me and a few friends got together and watched the season in one sitting.  We laughed like crazy for most of the night.  If you have never been to England or do not know anyone who is from England, you might not find Little Britain to be as hysterical as the rest of us, but you will still get a good laugh.  I especially enjoy the Prime Minister skits and Dafyd the only Gay in the village.  The sketches about Scotland are ignorable, but luckly the dvd special features allow you to pick which characters you like and only watch thier segments.  In conclusion, I found Little Britain overall to be a lot funnier than I had anticipated.  Some episodes are funnier than others, but you should get a good laugh.  Definitely worth purchasing if you are a fan of English humor.
