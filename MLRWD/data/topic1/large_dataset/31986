I very rarely (if ever) review movies. So why start now? Sometimes good things go unnoticed due to them being strange or not promoted right. Shaolin Soccer definitely falls into those categories. Movie is old by industry standards since it was made in 2001. It was recognized and wildly played in Asia and Europe but got none of the publicity in North America. Just like the title suggests Shaolin masters of Kung Fu are playing soccer. It's not another non stop Jackie Chan fighting movies. It has a decent plot; it has a fight between good and evil, greed and humbleness, lies and honesty. It teaches about friendship, being loyal, dedication and positive look on life regardless of the circumstances. And of course the special effects: amazing stunts and Matrix like action make it stand out from other Asian productions. Movie is well paced with no down time. Everything that happens, leads to more and more action. We have our share of baseball and football movies which all of them containing their dose of drama. Now it's time for a soccer movie. It's a bit of comedy mixed with action. Even if you've seen 1000 martial arts movies, even if you are sick and tired of sports genre flicks, see Shaolin Soccer. It is different and you will be glad you did.
