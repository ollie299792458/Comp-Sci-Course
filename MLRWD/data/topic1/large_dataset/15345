hi and welcome to my review, before i begin let me say i do not approve colorization of black and white movies.the new release of 20 million miles to earth a sci fi from 1957.special effects by the legendary ray harryhausen.what makes this a special package is that the colorization is supervised by ray harryhausen himself,which makes this even at a colorization an originality still intact.if the colorization was done by anyone it would be a disaster.the same man who did the special effects is also the color superviser.the colorization is really good.the ymir (creature)looks great in  green and the details is outstanding on the body (wish the acting was) i felt the monster was the best actor lol.this is a better print than the previous release.the black and white version to me is far more superior and the creature is more scary and threatening in black and white.to make a long story short you get two for the price of one color or black and white.widescreen anamorphic.all in all a great movie of the golden age of science fiction from the 1950's......
