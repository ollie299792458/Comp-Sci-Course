Alright, for people who plan on seeing this, don't expect your traditional slasher pic, as this is more of a traditional Japanese style horror film, the kind that makes you think about what you're watching.

Setting - 5/5:  I think the setting for this movie was perfect.  The way they depict Silent Hill is almost spot-on with how it is depicted in the games - filled with fog, devoid of people, and cut off from the rest of the world.  However, this is only half of the setting.  The other half, the "nightmare world" that it transforms into at times, is also superbly done.  The rust, blood, and dirt that covers the walls and floors of common everyday places, mixed with the feel of machinery in disrepair, make for a truly disturbing place.

Characters - 4/5:  The choice of characters is great, but I think they could have done better by changing a few of them.  I think people who have played the games recognize the names of Cybil, Dahlia, and Alessa and as such they expect the plot from the original games.  I feel if they changed the characters a bit they could have avoided some disappointed "hard core" fans, but if you've never played a Silent Hil game before, then this will all be fine.  The rest of the characters were done perfectly, in my opinion.

Theme - 5/5:  I think the theme came through pretty strong, which was to leave the viewer in the dark for most of the movie.  The games convey the same theme, where all will be explained in the end, but even after the climax, there's still a few questions left unanswered.

All in all, it was a great horror movie with equal parts physical horror and psycological horror.  If you like movies like the original Japanese "Dark Water," then this movie is for you.  If you're expecting a group of 20-somethings getting hacked to pieces while in the middle of a drinking party, then this isn't for you.
