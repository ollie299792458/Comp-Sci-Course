(my english isn't very good, so sorry if I have wrong words)
Introducing: I don't know why this movie flopped. It's one of the five best I have ever seen in my life (and I've seen every Hitchcock, Spielberg and Fincher movie). But I think it wasn't succesful, because everybody thought it's another Teen-Slasher -and this movies were in past very bad- (Thirteen ghosts - bad, Jeepers Creepers - very bad, Ghosts of Mars - ARRGHH). But the director John Dahl didn't borrow from Slasher movies, he borrowed from Spielbergs Duel and Hitcher. 
Acting: Leelee Sobieski, Paul Walker and Steve Zahn are the leading actors and I tell you: Everybody will win the Oscar in other movies in the future. This 3 actors are SOOO talented. They are sexy and the performances are fantastic. I think Paul, Leelee and Steve are now my favourite actors of all time. I love they. 
Directing: John Dahl is a great camera worker and there are great places in this movie. The script is great written. This movie is very suspensful. I'm schocked by the ending. WOW WHAT A FLASH. I think - no, I HOPE - there should be a Sequel. I don't know because only succesful movie have a Sequel, but I HOPE I HOPE PLEASE PLEASE JOHN DAHL MAKE A SEQUEL. If they make a Sequel I wish one of this 3 (Venna, Fuller or Lewis) die and the other 2 kill Rusty Nail, but I don't know: Joy Ride 2 or not? I don't know but hope every day!
