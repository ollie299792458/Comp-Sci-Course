I was very excited when I heard that Lexx, Season 1 was finally being re-released.  Finally, a way to get all 4 movies for a reasonable price.

As any fan of Lexx will tell you, this is not your ordinary Sci-Fi show.  It features quirky characters in an odd universe that drips with very thinly veiled erotic themes.  This is not a show for children, but for adults who can understand its mature themes.

Each movie comes on it's own disc, so there are 4 discs in total.  The insert unvolds to reveal 2 discs on each side, with one disc overlapping the other, making it impossible to remove the lower disc without first removing the upper disc.  This is a bit of a pain, and I would have preferred an individual thinpack for each disc.

Additionally, each movie is presented in "Fullscreen" 1.33:1 ratio rather than Widescreen 2.35:1.  It seems odd, given the populary of the Widescreen ratio, that they would choose to release this in Fullscreen instead.

Finally, the menu screens are very basic, with the only option beyond "Play" being the Chapter selection.  However, there isn't one single extra feature on any of the DVDs.  No deleted scenes, no cast interviews, and no commentaries.  Not even a TV spot or stills from production.  Absolutely nothing beyond the movies themselves.

Still, this is a great show that I would recommend to anyone looking for something different.  The show itself deserves a 5/5 rating, but this set deserves a 3/5 at best.  Part of me wonders if they'll come out with a better set in a few years, but I suppose that's the nature of these things.
