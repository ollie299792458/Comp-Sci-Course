Big Fish is the best movie I have ever seen and I have sent many, many people to see it and none have been disappointed. The easiest way to describe the movie would be "Terms of Endearment" for Sons and Fathers.  The son knows that his father is dying, but is unable to let go without at least trying to distinguish between his Father's "Fish" stories and his father's real life.  The viewer never knows until the very end of the movie where the truth lies in this senerio.  I assume many viewers will find themselves in this "non-chick" flick and so you may need some tissue, I did.  Also this is a Tim Burton masterpiece in production, visual effects, plot, music, and character interplay.
The sexiest scene I have ever viewed in a film takes place in Big Fish and yet there is no nudity in the scene.  Jessica Lang provides the viewer with her usual superb performance and the young version of her character looks so much like her the viewer forgets they are two different actors and both their performances are outstanding.  McGregor, although has lots of scenes in the movie, plays his part of the confused and somewhat angry son flawlessly.  The father and his younger version keep the viewer so entertained that you never want this film to end.  I would recommend this film to everyone over the age of 12.  It is not a good choice for real young children because Tim Burton has done such an outstanding job of producing this film and most of the scenes are bigger than life and would easily scare younger audiances, although this is not a scary movie.  It is brilliant and I do not understand why Hollywood has not given this picture more oscar attention and it is rare that I ever want to view a film more than once I intend to buy this DVD and watch it 100 more times.
