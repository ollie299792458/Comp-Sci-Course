When I heard they were making a movie out of the Stand I was skeptical because it is always so difficult to make the transition from book to movie. I must say that 'The Stand' succeeds wonderfully. The opening scene  with the view of the lab and BOC singing, "Don't fear the reaper"  sends chills down my spine every time I watch it! Some of the things the  movie cuts down on to save time are: we lose Rita completely, and instead  introduces Nadine to Larry in New York, we know nothing of 'the Kid' and  Trashys journey to the walkin' dude, and Lucy and Joe are abbreviated into  the background. We also lose the heroine in Frannie because we know nothing  of the abusive treatment she received from her mother. She does not convey  to us any grief over the loss of her father; nor are any of her concerns  for her unborn child mentioned. So other than my utter disappointment in  Frannie, and Molly Ringwald's portrayal of her being completely devoid of  any emotion, I thought the movie was a smash and I love not having to  rewind my DVD ;)
