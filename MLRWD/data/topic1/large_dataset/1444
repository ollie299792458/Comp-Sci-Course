With a cast of comedic cameos as long as your arm, anyone with humour at their heart will love this film. But this film is about more than just fun and passion. Steve's loveably extroverted yet disarmingly vulnerable character pulls you right into LA's confusing, egocentric yet ultimately appreciable ethos and displays it all before you, however subtly or blatantly, as the absurdly operable community it really is.
The film spans a few mid-life-crisis weeks in the life of a TV weatherman as he unknowingly tires of life's noise, pretense and folly, while escaping a dead relationship and desperately trying to defend his exhausted and scarred heart from the monumental forces of true love (Tennant).
The story itself is simple, if very original and amusing, but the rich texture of this film is seen in its canny observance, its sincere love of humanity and, ultimately, the subtle tapestry of a human heart exposed to a human world. As with all of Steve Martin's major roles, it is done with sympathy and sensitivity, but one can't help but feel that he put more of himself into this film than any other. With a beautiful soundtrack from Enya, and directing that really works with the LA backdrop, this film is one that hits you every time at its climax and will surprise you in new ways whenever you return to it.
If you want to know Steve Martin, buy it. If you want to laugh out loud and love life, buy it. If you don't want either of these things, watch a friend's copy - you'll buy it anyway!
