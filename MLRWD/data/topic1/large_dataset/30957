I don't remember seeing Jaws or even Jaws 2 in theatres.  The first Jaws movie I remember seeing in theatres was the horrid Jaws 3.  Anyway, the excellent transfer on this movie has to be seen to be believed.  I can tell that Universal spared no expense in restoring this movie.  It was worth it.  I really hope this movie continues to attract audiences, both new and old.  Believe it or not, Jaws still reminds me that shark attacks can and will happen and nobody is immune, not even Quint.  I will never forget his last stand when he met his match with the great white shark.  That scene makes me cringe every time I watch it.  I admire the painstaking effort of the cast and crew that went into the making of this movie and I especially applaud Steven Spielberg for sticking his neck out and making movies like this one and Saving Private Ryan.  This movie was the first summer blockbuster and it's in a league of its own.  Kudos to Universal for releasing such a mint copy of the film with extra features.  Happy Camper here.
