This might be one of the more lesser known Cary Grant roles, but it is one of my favorites.  It has some of the greatest and wittiest lines which will play over and over in you head.  Cary Grant plays a painter/bachelor, Richard Nugent, Cary Grant looks so handsome in this movie mind you, you will be wiping the drool from the corners of your mouth.  He keeps having run ins with the law and ends up in court before the wonderful Myrna Loy (remember her from the Thin Man series?), who plays judge Margaret Thatcher.  Well through various hilarious circumstances, her young sister Susan falls in love with Cary Grant, and Cary Grant has to be her "boyfriend" to avoid going to jail until she gets over him (yeah, like anyone can get over Cary Grant).  Anyway, hilarious events of course take place, and you will be completely mesmorized by Cary Grants abilities at physical humor.  Watch for the wonderful dinner scene towards the end of the movie, it will have you rolling.  He is able to steal every scene he is in.  If your looking for a light hearted comedy, look no further then Bachelor and the Boby-soxer.
