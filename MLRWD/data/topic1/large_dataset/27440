Several out-of-work men in the decaying town of Sheffield, England envision a scheme to earn money and the adoration of a town full of women...and thus begins the delightful story of 'The Full Monty.'  
I approached this movie with no expectations and found an incredibly funny and realistic look at hard times in a struggling town.  With jobs difficult to find and the town's women being lured to view the oiled bodies of Chippendale dancers, these friends take matters into their own hands in an attempt to reclaim the pride that was vanquished when they found themselves unemployed.  While their ultimate plan may be a strange way to take pride in themselves, these men pull it off quite humorously.
Aside from the general plot, this movie also gives us a glimpse of how families deal with hard times (including unemployment and divorce).  I found myself interested in not only the fantastic scheme of the men, but also in the dynamics of how these families would ultimately succeed.  All in all, I was quite impressed with the movie and enjoy watching it anytime I need a good laugh.  This movie may not make anyone's Top Ten list, but it is definitely effective when the desired result is a hearty bit of laughter.
