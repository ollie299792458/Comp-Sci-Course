The revenge flick is rarely ever pulled off with as much panache as in THRILLER: A CRUEL PICTURE.

Let's set aside, for a moment, the lame title.  I mean really!  A more appropriate title would be something like DIE!, DIE NOW! or DIE SWINE DIE, but that's an altogether different exegesis.

Essentially this is an extremely linear story that holds our attention with snippets of ultra-violence and hardcore anal action.  I'm not kidding.  Full on penetration.

So it's a fun watch, but the proportions are off.  It's about a 60/30 split on the victimization/revenge ratio, which tends to be the flaw in lots of these 70's yarns like I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE.  Jeez, how many times to you have to see a woman brutally savaged, raped and mutilated to get on board with her consequent merciless quest for vengeance.  I'd say just once and the scoundrels have it coming.  The fact is, from the first frame of flicks like this, I'm just marking time until the revenge.  The part of the film that establishes the bad guys as deserving to be revenged upon is kind of like the oral sex in a porno: It's an okay warmup, but let's get to the screwing already.

Likewise, THRILLER has us a little antsy for the revenge to arrive, and when it does finally, I must confess it's not quite as ass-kicking as I had hoped.  Alas.

Of course, it's a must see flick for anyone even remotely into the genre, and when it comes to the revenge game,"One Eye" most assuredly puts the likes of the celluloid Punisher to sheer and utter shame.
