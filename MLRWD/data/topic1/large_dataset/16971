It is strange but, the way movies are announced sometimes helps in  losing you. The marketing of Match Point emphasized the setting of this movie within the London upper class society and the relation between two couples: I was highly surprised when I found it was indeed a crime thriller, a genre very much in vogue again nowadays.  In the best way the movie deals with the story of a social climber and in one line his future brother in law uses clearly the word hustler, a hustler who plays by chance.  (Wait to see who wins).

Full of many literary, artistic, sports (the metaphor of the net is so good) and musical references very well crafted by Woody Allen (a connosieur), the movie also includes its victims  (whose names I don't tell) clues are given to you.  By the way, I keep saying when watching "someone is going to die here"...

A superb performance by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and an excellent appearance by Scarlett Johansson as an American aspiring actress, lost in this upper class greed.  She had become both the public and a Woody Allen's favorite.  Sexy and so pretty but tragic: remminissences of Marilyn Monroe?
