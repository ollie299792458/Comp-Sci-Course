When I first saw a preview for House, MD, I cringed at the thought of another medical-based TV program.  You've seen one, you've seen them all, right?  Absolutely wrong.  House, MD is one of the few shows I make the effort to get home to watch.  Not only did I purchase the entire 1st season on DVD, but the 2nd season just became available and I now I own it. The characters seem like real people who have real issues and are really relating to one another.  The principle character is amazingly bright and with the help of his team, is able to diagnose virtually every disease that enters the hospital.  The chemistry among the characters coupled with the clever direction suggesting how the body and all its functions actually function makes this one of the best programs to watch.  And finally, the writing is just phenomenal.  The dialogue is intelligent enough to make these people out to be believable doctors.  And at the same time, House's dialogue makes me laugh throughout the entire episode, even when the situation is not funny, which is most of the time.  I can't praise this program enough and I'm not that easy to please.  Watch it, you'll love it.
