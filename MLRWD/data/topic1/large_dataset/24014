I like Leslie a lot, and I have worked my way through the 1 and 2 mile tapes to get to this one (have ordered the 4-mile in anticipation of moving on to that).  This tape is extremely simplistic as far as moves, which may be a little too repetitive for some, but I like it as I can zone out and not have to concentrate on following complicated movements.  And young, very fit folks may find the workout a bit too easy, but I think it's perfect for us older exercisers.  I wish she spent just a little more time stretching at the end, but you can do that on your own.
After about a dozen times or so, once you know the routine, you start to notice little things.  Subtle interactions among the people behind her.  Leslie's smile-through-gritted-teeth when her response to "Beth"'s comeback about being short is to say "We'll be losing that" (but they left it in, gritted teeth and all).  Little things like those hold your interest.  I like watching "Randy" in the back.
I bought the round walk-away weights even though I have 2-lb dumbbells.  As another reviewer indicated, they are worth it--spheres just seem easier to hold while you move than classic dumbbells.
