This is the father of all the action adventure movies. It stands the test of time, I love it as much today as I did when I first saw it as a kid. Grant, Fairbanks and McLaughlin are terrific as the British soldiers on the frontier who fight among themselves constantly, but never hesitate to come to the rescue of their friends. Possibly the very first buddy movie as well.

Set on the Indian northwest frontier, the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevadas makes a perfect match for the place, and the steady hand of the director provides just the right touch of farce and high adventure. I can still hear the pipes as the Scottish troops march into the fanatics trap, and hear Gunga Din blowing the bugle to save the regiment. I never read Kipling's poem (on which this movie was loosely based) until I was an adult, but I still remember the last line, "you're a better man than I am, Gunga Din". And Sam Jaffe gets the chance to show the lowly water carrier's true heroism in a way that is as touching as it is profound.

A great movie, and one that today's directors would do well to watch. Maybe then they'd realize there's more to a good movie than buckets of gore and blowing stuff up. Gunga Din is still a head and shoulders above the pack.
