I just taught a course on Hamlet for Lifelong Learning and this was one of four film versions of Hamlet I used.  This is a very good short version of the play.  Mel Gibson does a credible job and the supporting cast is excellent.  Glenn Close as Gertrude is outstanding - she shows the giddiness and joy of new love which helps to explain the rashness of her remarriage.  Alan Bates as Claudius is likeable and you can see why Gertrude violated canonical law to marry him.  This is the incestuous relationship at the heart of the play.  Think of your mother marring your uncle.

The reason I did not use Olivier's Hamlet is that while it's a good film with great acting -  it's a very bad Hamlet.  Freud was very much in vogue at the time and Olivier distorted the movie to put overtones of the Oedipus Complex into it.  Also the Claudius in this film is obnoxious and there is no reason for Gertrude to marry him or for Hamlet to delay so long.

One of the important points of this play is the struggle between the two "mighty opposites" of Hamlet and Claudius. They have to be seen as  equals.  The best Claudius I have seen is Derek Jacobi in Branaugh's Hamlet (also my favorite version of Hamlet).

For a short version of the play, I would definately recommend this Hamlet over the Olivier version.

 Another point for viewers to note, in Shakespeare's time, a ghost could either be good or evil.  Hamlet has doubts about the truth of the ghost's statement until the mousetrap play proves the allegations.  At this time Hamlet assumes the ghost is a good, but sometimes an evil spirit can be telling the truth.  It is up to the viewer to decide if the ghost is from heaven or from hell.
