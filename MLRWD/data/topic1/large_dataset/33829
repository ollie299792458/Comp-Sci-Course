Not a great film, but a fascinating and quite wonderful one.  Many of the other reviewers tell almost the whole story, stopping short only just in time to avoid giving away the ending, but few of them mention the extraordinary sexual tension between Winger and Russell, each beautiful in her own way.  Apparently not quite clear to several of the reviewers here is the fact that Winger's character is quite sure almost from the time she stumbles across accounts of several suspicious murders that Russell's character is the killer.  It's not about finding it out at all -- it's about proving it.  When the two finally meet they are drawn to one another in spite of the suspicions each has about the other. Their supposed friendship is a device that each tries to work to her advantage, but the erotic pull between them as they play cat and mouse is real and can only be called delicious.  The minor roles are well played, especially by Nicol Williamson and the mannered, strange Dennis Hopper and Lois Smith.  If there is a weak link here, it is Samy Frey, who speaks his lines as if he learned them phonetically and wishes he were back in Paris.  Beautiful as the Hawaiian scenery is, the brief time spent near Seattle is just as beautiful. "Black Widow" is a movie that can be enjoyed many times.
