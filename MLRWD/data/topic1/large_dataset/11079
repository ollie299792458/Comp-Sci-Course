The "critics" who put this movie down for "hacking isn't really like that" &amp; other such whining are the same sorts who talk all the way through, say, "Princess Bride" complaining about the lousy portrayal of medieval history. In short: GET A CLUE, THIS IS ENTERTAINING. If you want Fact, you're barkin' up the wrong tree.
I'm a rabid reader of hard science fiction -- cyberpunk was half-lame, &amp; I'm mostly glad the fad is past. I also know enough about computers to get myself in trouble.
But "Hackers" is entertaining. Sure, there are a few moments where you're certain the cast is reading off different pages of the script, or the director has been called to the phone while the cameras were running.
Somehow, the whole mess manages to go "over the top" without sliding into abject, pedestrian cheesiness. I can't help but cheer for the good guys, &amp; The Villian is so hiss-worthy that I wait for him to twirl his mustache.
On top of it all, you get a precocious Angelina Jolie. Do I realy need to say more?
The best part of the film, though, is the soundtrack. I can't name another movies that has spawned **three** CDs. A fantastic selection of the era's synth-driven music that (mostly) still sounds fresh.
The pacing stumbles a bit near the end; in fact, almost all the good music is in the first 3/4 of the film. But, compared to something like "Lawnmower Man" that starts out incredibly &amp; falls apart utterly in the last 20 minutes, "Hackers" manages to make it to the tape.
It's worth the price of two movie tickets.
