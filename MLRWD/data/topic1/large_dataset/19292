I saw El Cid soon after its release in 1962 when I was just 12. I was then in an armed forces training school at Dehradun, India, and the entire college had to march five miles to the theater to see it as an inspiring and motivational film for future military leaders. We had never heard of the Cid or any other Spanish hero till then. But, when we left the hall, after seeing this 3-hour magnum opus, we were never to forget him. Since then I must have seen this film on video and in theaters scores of times. On every occasion I was moved afresh by the heroism and sacrifice of 'the man who rode away into legend'- El Cid. I do not think, except for Ben Hur, Sound of Music and Titanic, any other English film has made such a lasting impact. Yet, surprisingly and sadly, El Cid has never figured in the all time greats of Hollywood. Both Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren have given splendid and unforgettable performances, probably their best ever. Their characters and role have been superbly etched by a screenplay, which has done justice to a long but very well knit story. Both the indoor settings and outdoor locales, in which the film was magnificently shot, are so beautiful and natural, that one is literally transported into Spain in the Middle Ages. The lance duel on the plains of Calahara is superbly picturized in the timeless tradition of Hollywood immortal scenes. By the time the movie reaches its unforgettable climax you feel a hollowness creeping into your heart, for you realize that the magic of one of the greatest cinematic epics is about to end and you have no choice but to return to the dreary everyday world! I eagerly look forward to replace my ageing video cassette with the newly released DVD, which I am sure will give me viewing pleasure for as many years ahead as the tape and film versions had given me in the past.
