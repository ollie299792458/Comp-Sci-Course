I wanted to love this movie, and I can't say that I did.  It's very entertaining with a surreal quality thoughout the film, but there are few surprises.  It's not hard to predict what's going to happen, and director Lucky McKee seems to be aware of this.  He doesn't bother over-explaining things that viewers can reason for themselves or try to make shocks out of plot points we already see coming.  It's like being told a story you already know by a good storyteller.  The acting is excellent all around, and Bruce Campbell gets a small but mostly serious roll.  Overall it isn't the awesome follow up to May that we've all been waiting for, but it is further support for those of us who believe McKee to be an important director on the rise.

Now the DVD is another story.  The film has been dumped to video without a theatrical release or any extras.  The transfer is BAD.  Not unwatchable, but subpar for a movie produced by a major studio within the last few years.  The color is obviously meant to be stylized, but it never feels quite right and is inconsistant from one scene to the next.  There's an ugliness to many scenes that I doubt was intentional.  In one shot toward the end, Bruce Campbell has a weird orange halo when he's surrounded by darkness.  It looks like some kind of color matte that we aren't supposed to see, but the edges are clear.  The telecine people were either given poor instructions, no time, or both.

Final word:  Rent the movie, but hold out for a better DVD to purchase.
