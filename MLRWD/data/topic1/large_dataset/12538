100 Snazzes on the 100 point Snazz-o-Scale!

Starship Troopers is a superb movie. The special effects are absolutely stunning and it's almost complete action from start to end.

There's a little social commentary, for the government in charge of earth is tolitarianism I think, with severe limits on freedom. One woman explains she joined the military because she wants a baby, and it's easier to get a license if you're a citizen. A bureaucrat compliments Our Hero for joining the infantry, saying it was the infantry that made him the man he is today - he has no legs.

But the main reason to watch the movie though is its huge fantastic battles, lots of wonderful blood and gore, strange alien bugs, a little bit more blood and gore, phenomenal special effects, some more blood and gore, a body count in the thousands if not the millions, and even more blood and gore. Did I mention the blood and gore? Starship Troopers has been compared favorably to "Saving Private Ryan" in its Hack-Factor, that is it's mind-numbing violence. The humans have machine guns, nukes, and plasma cannons. The bugs too have plasma cannons, a flame thrower that shoots out their noses, but mostly they have sharp pincers. While a human must blow multiple parts off a bug to kill it, splattering everything with orange or green guts and goo, the bug will stab humans through the chest, lop off heads, bite off legs and rip bodies in two. Wowee, what fun!

Huge starships explode, crash into each other, or are torn in two by great plasma bolts, sending corpses tumbling into deep space. A guy gets his brains sucked out. A woman gets her arm burned off, two soldiers are reduced to flames, a soldier gets his brains blown out. Unparalleled violence and mayhem and all good clean fun.

Watch it!
