The Funk Brothers - what an apt name for this 'family' of musicians who went through so much of popular music history as unheralded studio musicians. You don't have to be a Motown fan to enjoy this movie - just a music lover who enjoys the stories behind the sounds. During parts of this movie I wept silently - it is so moving! The story of James Jamerson Sr alone is worth telling, let alone the rest of the band. The tragedy of the tale is that too many band members did not live to garner the recognition they deserved. 
Some great anecdotes are espoused by these long-retired muzos, including these little beauties:
* the 3-man guitar section was known as the Oreo section for a while - two black guitarists with a white one in the middle!
* one of the drummers had to decide whether he was going to be a musician (trombonist) or a boxer - in the end he decided to be a drummer, because his lip kept getting beaten up and he couldn't play the trombone properly!
At the tribute concert (in Detroit, of course), it is great to see contemporary musicians who understand the significance of the music (and are hugely talented to boot) performing with the band. The list is impressive: Joan Osborne (a wonderful rendition of 'What Becomes of the Broken-Hearted'), Chaka Khan, Ben Harper (not an electric performer but certainly soulful and sincere), and the outrageously flamboyant Bootsy Collins - and there are more besides.
If I have one complaint, it is that we might have seen more of the lead artists commenting on the band - in particular Stevie Wonder, who got to work with them in his early career. It's hard to see why he would not have made a contribution to the film - there are a few photos of him and one clip from news footage in the 80s, but this does not compare to a current interview with the benefit of hindsight. 
However, this is a fabulous film that will leave you with an entirely different perspective on music. Thank goodness it was made!
