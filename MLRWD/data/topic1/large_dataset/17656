This film - as others have stated - is up there with An American Werewolf in London. For me, this is the scarier film and has the better transformation. They are a landmark and makes you cry at the thought of it being redone today via dodgy CGI (American Werewolf in Paris, Bad Moon etc).

The werewolves are also the coolest EVER! Standy uppy, giant werewolves have always been my favourites but they go even further that as the head, mouth, teeth and ears are all shaped as I imagined the "perfect werewolf" to be.

Though lacking the dry humour of AMIL, this is a stand out film in it's own right. the only reasons why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because of:

a) the dodgy animated love scene by the camp fire; and

b) the cute poodle that Dee Wallace becomes at the end. Apparently, it seems that the studio guessed we would have more sympathy if she looked somewhat cuddly.

These werewolves are bad arse! They shapeshift at any time - night or day - and can seriously f**k you up!

The coolest scene was when Eddie Quist (as werewolf) casually picks a file out of a nosey woman's hand, before gently placing it down and then giving her an almighty back hander...whilst roaring in that menacing, freaky way they all do.

Just watch it for the transformation scene of Eddie Quist alone.

That and a cameo by Dick Smith.

Amazing!
