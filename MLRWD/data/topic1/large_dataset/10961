I am about to go and get it.  I have the other two and want them all.  Around the NY area, I just cannot seem to see these on TV anymore.  That is the main reason bought them.  If it was on TV regularly like other show, I probably could live without it.

About that dude from Australia.  What in the hell is it any of his concern about the treatment of white people?  The show does not take place in Melbourne and if it had given the way that they are racist (just like South Africa also.  See that ANGLO connection...?) also and a Good Times over there would have been worse.  They could not have even called the show Good Times because those poor natives are having bad times due to Anglo opression.  Australia and New Zealand are occupied territories and still remain British outposts.  The old British emipre is still intact, just without America.  That is why they stand by us at any cost.  If they don't, they risk having everything fall apart.  I still say that they are waiting for their chance to take this land back.
