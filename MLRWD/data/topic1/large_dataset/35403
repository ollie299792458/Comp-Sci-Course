This is one of those rare movies that gets it all right. Action, story, acting, dialogue, visuals, music, it's all there in one tight package. It's one of my all-time favorites, I could (and have) watch it again and again.

About the only negative thing I could say is that there's a bit of hokey dialogue (the captain Kirk bit to be specific), and a few inaccuracies here and there, as pointed out in the reviews by Navy veterans. But hey, this is a MOVIE not a training film.

One thing that came to mind - and this occurred to me MUCH later after thinking about the events in the movie - is that would the U.S. really launch a nuclear strike from a submarine in a scenario such as depicted here? Seems like a carrier airstrike with F-18's dropping conventional bombs would be enough to wipe out the rebel missiles without risking WW3. But like I said, this thought didn't even occur to me when I was watching the movie, so completely engrossed was I.

If you haven't seen it yet, watch the original theatrical version. The extended version with deleted scenes contribute nothing to the film and detract from the pacing. Those scenes were deleted for a good reason. The editor did a great job the first time.
