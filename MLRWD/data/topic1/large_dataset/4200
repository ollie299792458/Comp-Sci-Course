Although I don't regret watching this film and would, possibly, watch it again sometime, it just doesn't top my list of favorites among Gong Li's other films. Since I find Gong Li to be very beautiful, I can't help be disappointed that you can hardly see her properly throughout the movie, considering she's bundled up most of the time. Also, being that the plot revolves around a complaint that goes through several chains of command due to the same unsatisfactory results, one can't help feel like you're watching the same scenes over and over, which isn't very entertaining (unless you absolutely love that scene to begin with). I mean you can tell that some scenes are even recycled during the film. Don't get me wrong--it's not like I'm someone who can't appreciate the subtlety of things. I realize that we're watching something important and very real to some people, but I'm just warning viewers that the movie's filled with scenes/lines that are basically the same throughout, so if that sounds boring to you, then don't watch this film. If you're interested in watching a Chinese film that's historical and emotional and packs more of a punch, then I suggest you check out "To Live" with Gong Li.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JM6H">To Live</a>
