When the opening scene at a joust resounds with Queen's "We Will Rock You", I knew this was a different movie.  I love fantasy and humor (and drama and romance) and this has it all.  Heath Ledger is compelling (it took me awhile to realize he had also been in "10 Things I Hate About You" since he's a blond here).  The anachronistic (modern) touches are wonderful.  The entire cast has great humor and acting ability, especially Paul Bettany (Chaucer) who is enchantingly outrageous (even when is wardrobe is ... lacking. *smile*. I also liked the small part of the character Germaine, Adhemar's herald, which evolves nicely in the background. This movie feels like a combination of Willow and Princess Bride in some ways (a good story with sometimes marvelously silly touches).  I watched the movie on a Sunday afternoon, devoured the featurettes and behind the scenes material (suggest 1 pass just watching deleted scenes, then a second pass with director/editor commentary).  I had to go out Sunday evening, but when I got back, I finished the special material and watched the whole movie again.  I've just put the DVD in my Amazon wish list for my next round of orders, since my daughter (20) and I (40+) both think this is 'a keeper'.
