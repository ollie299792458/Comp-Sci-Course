Having already been warned about this movie I prepared myself by having a large amount of beer at hand.  The theory was that once drunk enough even the most infantile of humor could be at least mildly amusing.  As the movie progressed I was forced to injest more and more alcohol.  Now that the movie has finished I am quite drunk but unfortunately was still unable to laugh once during the movie.

If you want to be entertained by this movie may I suggest that you never let it anywhere near your dvd player.  Instead you should take the dvd and see how far you can throw the thing, preferably into a steaming pile of feces where it belongs.

This movie is totally devoid of any plot instead relying on Tom Greens "comic genius" to provide the content, this was a very bad mistake.  If I were to give this man 1% of the brain cells I just anhiliated in my drinking binge he would be infinitely more intelligent, although having seen this movie I would suspect that Tom would simply eat any biological material offered to him.  The only way that anyone could possibly replicate this kind of trash is to lobotomize a group of four year olds and throw them into the "Big Brother" house.

This movie is more infantile than the "Teletubbies", less funny than an autopsy video and about six times as gay as any homosexual porno.

I am genuinely surprised that Tom Green is allowed to walk the streets much less able to produce an internationally distributed film.
