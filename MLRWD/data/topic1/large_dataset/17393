I couldn't wait to see this movie because I'm a horse lover and the previews looked great but, I am so glad that I waited for the video. I only wish I had rented it instead of buying it. My 3 year old lost interest in this movie after the first 15 minutes. As soon as he saw that these animals weren't going to speak or make him laugh, he moved to another room to watch Dragon Tales. While I agree with other opinions that the quality of the animation is excellent, I don't see how a small child could possibly follow this movie unless they have a VERY CLEAR understanding and bright vocabulary of facial expressions and body language. I understand the opinions of some reviewers when they stated that it was refreshing and more emotional to see the animals communicate non-verbally. I personally enjoyed watching it (once) BUT, I definatley wasn't intrigued enough to "pop it in" since. Frankly, I was shocked to see all the positive reviews. It's sold at local video stores in my area for an average of 6 dollars because they weren't moving off the shelves.
