What was the "Crying Game" all about? It is hard to say, but one thing is for sure, it was put together in a genius fashion. The viewer is unsure where it all steers at and the famous revelation of Dil's secret is only one point in the story, although it puts a lot of pepper in. Sometimes you will find that certain viewers tend to be disgusted by even a mention of that being possible, but it seems some of them were quite enchanted by the beautiful Dil until then. 
In general, the cast is doing a very good job and makes it easy to relate to the characters, what, in a story like that, is probably more difficult than it looks like. The script full of twists is very well written and the production should be applauded for having the courage to kill one of the main actors right after the beginning (which is not to say, killing an actor early on always makes a great movie).
If you are open minded enough for watching an individual look on the Northern Ireland problem mingled with an unusual lovestory, this is a must-see!
