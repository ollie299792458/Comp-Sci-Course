I remember watching this movie with my children. We all enjoyed it so much. It is a movie for all who have an imagination and think that maybe there are other beings in our universe.

There are so many movies made for children today that are really great, but I don't think there are any that can take the place of "E.T.The Extra-Terrestrial"

For some reason I thought about the movie during the holidays and ordered it at a well known book store that carries vidios, as they did not have it in stock. After the holidays they informed me they could not get the movie as their distributor did not have it. I was very happy that Amazon.com had it in stock!

I bought the movie for my three 1/2 year old grandson to watch. He loves anything to do with dinosaurs and other unusual creatures. He loved the movie, and I enjoyed watching it with his mother and him. His mother also enjoyed it very much, as she had seen it when she was young.

It was very refreshing to watch this heartwarming and beloved movie once again. It is now in my vidio library.

Sincerely,

Helen Snider
