I am not a big M. Night Shyamalan fan and have not really liked any of his other works... In fact, I thought they were pretty dumb. "The Village" however is the cream that rises to the top of Shyamalan's portfolio. To all of you people out there who thought this movie sucked, I must respectfully say that you are wrong. "The Village" is not a crappy movie it is just a movie that presents us something we are not expecting. Admittedly it draws you in as a horror movie or at least a suspense thriller but it evolves into/ is something else... maybe even something better.

"The Village" is really a story of love and utopian beliefs and whether or not they can come to fruition either today or at any point in the history of man. This movie explores the relationships between: a man and a woman, friends, family and community and then produces a well thought out work of art. For those of you out there who think that the artsy shots were for nothing, did you listen to the dialogue were you watching the same movie? I think this movie may not be for the standard audience, and that perhaps it would have done better as an art house flick because it is full of meanings and symbolism the average viewer may not understand. Shyamalan has crafted a movie with as much intellect as a book and that is no easy feat.

All of you who understood this movie should pat yourself on the back and all of you who didn't should watch it again because it is perhaps one of the best movies of the year.
