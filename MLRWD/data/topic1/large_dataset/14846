I love South Park... it's my favorite animated show. I've been a fan since day one, so it's natural for me to own the DVDs... Of course I started with Season 1, which has 3 DVDs put in a beautiful boxset.
The complete 1st season has 13 episodes with additional bonus features like "interactive menus", "scene access", music videos and classic SP promos.
The set opens like a book, revealing 3 DVDs with various pivtures on them. Disc 1 has football players on the cover, and that's not all, the cover shows how the killed... oh c'mon, you know who! KENNY!! ;) The cover art of disc 2 is Kyle and Kenny as a Platypus. Oh yeah, Kenny's dead! ;) The cover art of disc 3 is again... kenny, but you can't really see if he's dead or not, as he's watching you but you can see something's happened to him.
Don't want to reveal any more info, I want you to be surprised. Fans of SP, be sure to buy every season there is, you won't be disappointed. And, as ike says, "Don't hit the baby!!" ;) :D
