Great animated features are able to entertain people of all ages and levels of education. The original Hoodwinked is just such a movie. While Hoodwinked Too! may appeal to children, it has little to offer the rest of us. The storyline is flat with few surprises. The clever, multiple narratives interlacing the original movie's storyline are missing from the sequel. A couple of the principal voice actors have been replaced (Red, Kirk the Woodsman) causing their characters to lose some their edginess. Benjy Gaither's Japeth (the goat) has been reduced from a self-reliant and resourceful genius to a helpless, Job-like victim.
Something in the artistic quality of the drawn characters was also lost in their CGI transformation in order to appeal to the 3-D market. The extensive time and creative talent that went into producing the original is clearly missing from Hoodwinked Too! If the producers, goal was to produce another children's movie quickly, and under budget then they have succeeded. If their goal was to reprise the success of the original Hoodwinked, they have failed. Perhaps, because the first movie was so great, I am disappointed because I expected more.
