First I'll start with the obvious.  This movie is action-packed and is filled with all the tension of a good thriller almost from the word go.  There's plenty of guns and explosions and blood for the action movie fan.  However, what I think makes this movie better than the average action movie is the performances.  First of all, Ben Foster does a fabulous job as Mars Krupcheck.  This guy gave me the creeps more than any horror movie killer has ever done.  Finally, Bruce Willis.  Now, I know he is known for his action/comedy work, but, in this movie, he gives maybe his most emotional performance to date.  The hurt is written plainly on his face as he deals with becoming involved, once again, in a complicated and violent hostage negotiation (which he tried to leave behind after he lost a little boy a year before the action takes place).  He has all the passion and anger of a typical action hero when need be, but there are also quiet moments when he needs to show his character's sadness and despair.  In these moments, his performance really touched my heart.  I won't give too many specifics, so as not to ruin any surprises along the way, but Willis really impressed me in this one.  It is these performances that make this movie stand out for me.  In short, this is a good movie for anyone who enjoys action films, but also for anyone who really loves to see a movie that is just plain good.
