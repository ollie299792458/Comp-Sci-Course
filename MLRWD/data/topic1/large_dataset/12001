Finally, I found THE "Harvey" film on amazon.com! I've waited DECADES for the chance to buy this movie for my own home.  Can any of you remember sitting in your childhood homes as little  kids, watching the great Jimmy Stewart talk to a large (invisible) rabbit  on your parents' old black &amp; white TV?  I remember seeing this movie  but a few times, yet, each time, it always served as instant therapy for  dissipating any anger toward the crazier people in my life.  When I was a  child, I thought it was funny that the movie showed a man who was being  told to lose his imaginary friend.  As an adolescent, I empathized with  knowing what it is like to live with someone who, I thought, lived and  worried in a world of their own making.  And as an adult, I now realize  that one can acknowledge the world of another, without having to remain  there permanently.  If you have ever suffered through the day-to-day trials  of dealing with someone who lives by a grand set of rules different from  your own (generational or cultural gap?), and if you have ever found  yourself stressed from the craziness of it all, then maybe this wonderful  and comical film will ease your frustration for a while each time you view  it.  As I remember this movie, it is a story that begins with the simple  pleasures of courteous greetings, kindness to others and imaginary friends,  then moves to one family's struggles with sanity, possible family  separation, love and protection. It has a happy ending and, like the movie  "It's a Wonderful Life", is a MUST for every family home library!
