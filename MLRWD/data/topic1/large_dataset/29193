I was too young to have seen "Maude" when it was on network TV, and it was never re-run in my market growing up, so it is completely new to me.  It is a wonderful show, and though much of the supporting cast is adequate to good, there is no question that the whole thing hangs on Bea Arthur's performance.  (The following is a spoiler--if you don't want specific details, skip to the next paragraph).  I knew I was hooked during the fourth episode, when Maude's daughter is dating Maude's former flame.  All vinegar about it initially, Maude softens when she hears that the ex called her daughter "Maude" when they were together.  Maude assumes it was during lovemaking, and as Maude discovers this, the camera freezes on the back of her head for about 5 seconds--an eternity in sitcom time.  After a pause like that, you have to deliver a knockout, and when Bea Arthur turns to face the camera, utterly transformed by the memory of a past love into a pile of mush, you will be absolutely convinced that she is one of the best actresses ever to grace an American television program.

What impresses me about the show, is that there is a lot of plot packed into these shows--it is depressing to me how current sitcoms have devolved into 20 second scenes of setup/punchline then switch to another scene.  This show deals intellegently with topical issues, never stretching for the laughs--but they come, and when they do, they are genuine and organic.  I have trouble believing that this show was lodged in the Top 5 of the Nielsens for much of its run--I just don't think it could happen today.  It is a great show.
