This was always my favorite Christmas cartoon/musical since it first aired back in 1962 (I was eight). I watched it year after year, and was dissapointed and filled with a sense of longing for many years because I could not ever find it being broadcast since I was about 14.
I finally got the DVD (2 copies! - one for my neice) in March, but I didn't watch it until just this week (I was putting it off to savor). While I was contemplating watching, but before I had done so, the music of "The Lord's Bright Blessing" (one of two "show stoppers") was running through my head, even though I hadn't heard it in over thirty years! That's how memorable this was to me. When I actually saw the scene, it brought tears to my eyes (really!).
If you remember this as fondly as I do, by all means, go ahead and get it. The extras are nice, particularly the "Magoo Meets Gerald McBoingBoing." 
If you've never seen this, and whether you have kids or not, but especially if you do, you owe it to your family to add this to the suite of holiday traditions. Right up there with "Miracle on 34th Street," "It's a Wonderful Life," "White Christmas," and all the rest!
