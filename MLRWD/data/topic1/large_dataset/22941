I like the first Shrek, LOVE the second one and the third one is right up this with my favorite movies.

This...this is along the same caliber of Return of Jafar. Having the same voice cast is not the only thing you need for a good movie, plot and continuity - something the directors of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, the first three Shrek Movies and many other sequels - have managed.

This movie is boring and predicable, and not particularly funny. As an adult I enjoyed the other three movies - this one was frustrating. NOTHING lined up with the other movies. Shrek didn't exist and that made Far Far Away change forever. Shrek wasn't a huge part of Far Far Away until he rescued Fiona. In the second movie the King knew that Prince Charming would - eventually - rescue Fiona because he had promised it to the Fairy Godmother.

The only reason Puss in Boots was associated with Fiona was because of Shrek, the King never would have met Puss if Shrek hadn't married Fiona and stood in the way of Prince Charming and the Fairy Godmother. See where I'm going with this? And when Shrek met Fiona she was so caught up in the "my prince will rescue me" bit that it's not even plausible that she would have tried to escape. Last but not least, Rumplestiltskin was IN Shrek 3, in one of the Tavern scenes with Prince Charming.

I saw this movie in the theatre and I left extremely disappointed. I bought the other three movies individually - there is no way I'd waste my money on this garbage. I'd rather buy the third Aladdin movie from Disney.

If you're a devoted Shrek fan because of the humor that adults and kids can enjoy, great plot and a good romance, this isn't the movie for you. If you just want another Shrek movie - here you go.
