August 27th 1990 will always be a sad day. I had lived in Texas for a few years, and went to the candlelight vigil in Kiest Park the day before the funeral. I had never(and still haven't) seen so many people crying in my life. But along with the sadness was a celebration of his life. There were people who he had played with in early bands who brought along pictures and told stories of the early days. I wish I could remember who they were. But it was a special night, and I won't forget it.

 Tonight marks 14 years that he has been gone, but his legacy lives on. If you ever forget what a guitar genius sounds like, put this in your DVD player. The performance is second to none, and although the cameras bob from time to time, they get some great shots of his fingerwork along the fretboards. It just plain takes your breath away. In thirty years, there will be a kid sitting in his living room trying to figure out how he could play like that!

 Simply put, Stevie Ray Vaughan was on a planet all his own. Buy this DVD.
