I thought this was a fantastic movie.  To the other comments given I want to add only this:  When one of the falsely imprisoned girls decides to tell the king that she is guilty so that her friend may go free, it's only the culmination of several  events calculated to build a false sense of guilt in the one who stays behind.  It is tempting, and heartbreaking, to imagine that  this girl who falsely gives herself up has come to the conclusion that, she really is sufficiently guilty to spend her life in prison after all, just on "general principles", as it were.  With regard to the drugs themselves, it seemed to me that the girl who "confessed" had had it driven into her, by court appearances and months of incarceration, that she was simply guilty because the drugs were in her backpack, since her assertions that she didn't know they were there were useless.  Though this takes place in a foreign country I found the idea of such severe punishment for an unknowing pawn in a crime chilling nonetheless.
