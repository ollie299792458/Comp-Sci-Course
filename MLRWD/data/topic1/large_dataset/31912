Like many others, I loved Knots Landing when it was on the air, and I still love it today. I kept all the episodes on my old VHS tapes, but when the first season was available on DVD, I bought it without any hesitation. I will buy all seasons if Warner decides to release them.
To this day, I still consider Knots the best nighttime soap. I watched all of them, Dallas, Dynasty, Falcon Crest, etc and I will continue to support those series when the become available on DVDs. I already bought the first 9 seasons of Dallas, and the 3 of Dynasty.
Regarding KNOTS LANDING, I believe the show became much better after the 4th season, so I wish Warner would release the seasons more quickly!
I want to say I really appreciate that the French subtitles are offered on the DVDs of Knots. Those subtitles were also available on the first seasons of Dallas, but not later on.
Knots Landing being available on DVD will give a chance to new people to discover the series. Desperate Housewives is a huge success now and I'm sure that all the fans will appreciate Knots as well.
So if you are a old fan of Knots, show your support by buying the DVD sets, and if you want to become a new fan, just do the same !
KNOTS LANDING FOREVER !!!
