If you've read Jeff Shannon's Editorial Review above, you'll have noted several points open to question.  Mr. Shannon suggests that director Michael Bay's previous work was somewhat lacking in intelligence.  I disagree.  However, let's address this one.

In the beginning, we find ourselves in a sort of post-apocalypse situation.  Something called THE CONTAMINATION has devastated the earth, leaving the machine-like civilization under ground, and, oh, yes, there's an ISLAND somewhere that escaped devastation.  The undergrounders run a lottery that gives random citizens a ticket to the fresh-air paradise of The Island.

The undergrounders are conditioned not to question, but one of them, Lincoln Six Echo (Mr. McGregor) begins to do just that, and quite accidentally discovers that things are going on that the population isn't told about.

Mr. Shannon denotes as antecedents "Clonus" as well as several other items.  I find myself thinking that "The Island" is a most clever and fast moving mixture of "Brave New World", "THX 1138", "The 6th Day," and "The Matrix", with dashes of "Transporter" and even "Judge Dredd".

The only aspect I would have asked for more of, would be the sly humor that James Cameron tends to tuck in his work.  And "The Island" is a bit predictable in spots, but that isn't always bad.  You can sit there and think about how smart you are, while you enjoy the film.  I did.

Besides Mr. McGregor and an atypically slightly-less-than-sexy Ms. Johansson, one welcomes the neat performances of Djimon Hounsou and Sean Bean.

If you're crazy about action, what have you got to lose?  If you haven't seen this one yet, go for it!
