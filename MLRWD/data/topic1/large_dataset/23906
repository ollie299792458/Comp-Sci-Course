Great set, great actors, great storyline, great soundtrack.  I've watched this movie so many times I know what scene is occurring just by hearing what part of the dramatic score is playing.  The actors are of the finest caliber.  They don't make actors like that any more, they seem straight out of the classical world of theater, having so much beauty and raw power in every expression and every movement.  Every line is classic and potent, even though there is not much dialogue, which should be a disappointment for me because I love clever scripts and smart dialogue; however, the actors are so great at acting that their faces and actions say more than they ever could, so I don't mind the sparseness of the spoken word.

It may be too dated for some, but the galley scene and the chariot race scene are some of the greatest "action" scenes there are. Brutal and violent as well.  I can't believe my mother let me watch the galley scenes when I was six or seven.

The book is great as well and different from the movie, however both cover what all great stories are about, glory and tragedy and the fall and rise in between.  If anything, watch the movie for Charlton Heston's performance. If you want to see a man and a man with all of his emotions ( rage, sorrow, revengeful, unable to comprehend), than there is no better place to see one than Heston's Judah Ben Hur.

 PS Love scenes are a bit cheesy, but there are also what you would have seen on the stage way back when.
