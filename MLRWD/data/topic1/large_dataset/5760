Okay.. First of all I want to say a lot of kids movies are ANNOYING... But My HUSBAND, ME & Both of my children (1 son 3 1/2, 1 daughter 3 1/2 (twins)) LOVE Every single Barbie movie! We have every one!! We have watched them so much we have had to buy 2nd copies to keep watching!! We love them all, some more than others, but I do recoment all of them...

We just bought "barbie and the three musketeers" to add  to our collection. We love it... Its fun, up beat and very exciting. One thing I love about this movie is that it does have great music and makes it fun for the kids so they can dance and sing along!! One reviewer said the music was distracting but I guess if you just want your kids to sit in one spot and watch a movie instead of live in the movie and soak it in and be excited about it... My kids can sit through any movie they love and watch the whole thing.. but it was so exciting they were up dancing, my daughter was yelling at the movie, they had a great time watching it!!! I very much recoment this movie! SOO CUTE!!!

I do have to say one thing though... i was a little dissapointed... My daughters favorite thing in the entire world is HORSES.. and when I saw the preview I thought their would be more horses in it.. .but there were not very many horses in it at all!.. I was really dissapointed with that...

Our favorite Barbie movie is The Diamond Castle! Can't tell anyone how great that movie is! it is all of our favorites! YES EVEN MY HUSBAND LLLOOOVVVEESS it!
