My parents recorded this in the early 90s when it was broadcast on TNT. Over the years, it's been a family favorite and the tape is no longer in good condition. There are clips available on YouTube, but I have been eagerly awaiting the release on DVD.

This was my first introduction to Christian Bale, and even at a young age his performance is deserving of awards. This is also one of my favorite Charleton Heston performances - and when rereading the novel I hear his voice when reading the lines of Long John Silver. The genius casting and the great acting (even of the lesser characters) really makes this adaption stand out. The soundtrack really contributed to my listening more to movie scores. The movie is shot partly on soundstage in England and exteriors were shot in Cornwall and Jamaica with realistic sets and historically accurate firearms and costuming.

This movie will have you on the edge of your seat from the beginning to end. The pirates will make your skin crawl. And you'll want to go track down this (Treasure) Island paradise for your next vacation
