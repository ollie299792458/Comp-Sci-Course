I saw this movie in theaters when it first came out. (I'm buying the DVD today)I was living in Pensacola at the time (BIG USN and USMC city)and I saw it with my girlfriends.  The biggest mistake one can make in going to view this movie is that it's a war movie.

There won't be any long battle scenes (think Black Hawk Down, Independence Day, or Saving Private Ryan, etc). The climax of the movie is subtle but it's there. If one sits down to watch Jarhead and wait and wait and wait for the big Hollywood war scene, they will be disapointed.  It's kind of like watching the Lord of the Rings expecting everything to be resolved at the end of the first movie.

You will enjoy the adult humor and feel emotion during Swof's long desert deployment and perhaps even learn a few new words and their definitions (Jody, anyone?)

Those serving in the military and those that have loved ones that are or have been deployed, (like myself) will understand the meanings and know what the characters in this movie go through.

I recommend it to everyone, at least rent it before making that big commitment to purchase it.

Thanks.
