The film dialogue is either so bad as to make one cringe, or an intentional parody of itself. I've watched it many times and still can't decide. The sets the film was shot on (all indoor), produce a neon-noir surrealism where 50s punk meet 80s hair bands in the wild, wild west, in a neon city setting. I like this film, but would find it hard to give sufficient reason for liking it; Highnoon with pickaxes and fists, best describes it. However, the films greatest redeeming value is the soundtrack. It is scintillating. There are few, if any, rock'n'roll film scores that can hold a candle to it. There's a double shine to the film soundtrack to boot. Ry Cooders killer-filler slide guitar work is supurb. The CD Soundtrack to the movie, though very good, doesn't have Cooders guitar work on it, which is a shame. The soundtrack on the DVD includes Cooders guitar work along with the excellent rock'n'roll tracks. The price of the DVD, if just for the film score, is in my opion, worth every dime spent, and for less than $10, a steal.
