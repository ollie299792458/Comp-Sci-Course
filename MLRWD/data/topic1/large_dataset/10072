Didn't think I'd like Napoleon Dynamite, now I watch it once a month.  Jumped at the chance to see Nacho Libre and now I watch that regularly too.  This is nothing like either one of those with the exception of the intro and low budget look.  I try not to compare a film against its predecessors but even on its own its just poor.  I have to admit that Clement amazing, but he has little to work with here.  Poor guy cant get a break.

The main character keeps switching from a sloppy deadpan to apparent constipation.  He was probably told to keep emotionless but had to stop periodically to weep quietly.  Its neither funny nor relatable.  That is unless you've had someone who was mildly interested in you eat the sick off your face before.  Watching him walk through a constant gauntlet of embarrassment is like watching a cat get kicked for an hour and a half only to swipe gently at its attacker in the last few minutes.

As for the comedy its an endless string of groin jokes, every slang term, symbol, and joke apart from a AFV football gag are strung together with a sprinkling of other bodily fluids.  All the disgusting humor would be a lot more amusing if it were set up properly, but no care is taken in the setup or delivery.  Theres no real loss, vindication, motivation, or redemption.  You just feel sad after watching a loser end up a published loser.  Apart from 2 or 3 minutes its a total waste.  Just stop watching after the intro.  I'm going to pretend it never happened and keep hoping for more Hess.
