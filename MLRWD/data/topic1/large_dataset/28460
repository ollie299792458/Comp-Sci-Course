A pretentious film that's lovely to look at for the most part.
Charlotte Rampling, blocked British mystery writer, borrows the country home of her publisher in order to unblock herself. Rampling, upon arrival, does her smirky smile thing. She carefully assembles her laptop and goes to work. She eats something that resembles yogurt. She discovers the swimming pool, covered, and leaves it that way.
Eventually the publisher's daughter Julie turns up. She's French hottie Ludovine Sagnier. A young blonde with a narrow triangular face and classic nose (when shot in profile you'll maybe think she has features that really belong on the front of a coin), she lives a messy life and upsets the orderly Rampling more than somewhat. She uncovers the swimming pool and skinnydips about among the leaves that have collected. At this point the movie comes to life for a while. Probably you'll enjoy the scenes in which Ms. Sagnier romps around in various states of undress. 
Eventually, there is (perhaps) a murder. Eventually Rampling loosens up and unlooses the inner writer in her. Or maybe the inner plagiarist. 
By then, you probably won't care very much. 
Notes and asides: There is no director commentary. There are 11 minutes of deleted scenes. Ms. Sagnier does not appear in them. Since there was no reason to have included them in the first place, this is a complete waste of time.
