Good quality film and acceptable sound on the first disc.

As for the second disc, the interviews with various tangiential players is for the most part fascinating, above all that with George Martin, although he comes off a bit snobbish.  Among other pieces of knowledge he imparts, he explains the significance of "Can't Buy Me Love" and its twelve-bar blue structure.  It's a bit surprising how little he thinks of some of the other hits, such as "I'm Happy Just to Dance with You."

Two particularly fascinating bits of trivia for me:  the truant "Southerner" boy in the Ringo scene turns out later to have been a regular supporting cast member in the "Keeping Up Appearances" UK TV sitcom, one I've frequently watched.  And it's finally made clear why Paul's grandfather is "very clean" (it has to to with Wilfrid Brambell's prior role as the father in Britain's predecessor to our "Sanford & Son":  "Steptoe and Son").

We also gain insight into the photography and lighting of the film, and most interestingly, into the groundbreaking directing style of Richard Lester.  What is it about HDN that made it so special?  Not worrying too much about the directing, the rehearsing...  just going with the flow.  The very natural and yet unusual camera angles.  Many cinematographic techniques first showcased in this film are still used today.  I found Lester's reasoning behind inserting early in the film surreal frames like the boys inexplicably running alongside the train in order to prepare the viewer later for the dreamlike, surreal quality of the "I Should've Known Better" sequence fascinating.

Though the bonus features might be considered dry and of marginal interest to some, this edition offers a lot for the buck.  I was happy to replace my old worn-out VHS home-recorded copy with this nice DVD package.
