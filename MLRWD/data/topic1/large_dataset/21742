The story lacks substance and depth. You don't feel the character's suffering as a quadriplegic and the reason for his petition becomes irrelevant in my opinion. The actors are all in their element and give a decent performance, including Aishwarya Rai much to my chagrin because I think she is a less than mediocre actress. Sanjay Leela Bhansali could have done a better job of portraying the character as a man whose body is wasting away in order to garner the attention of the audience and make us understand why he is in so much agony. It's difficult to feel sorry for the character of Ethan when he is shown to have a successful career with a legion of fans after the accident that left him disabled. Not too many people who are disabled have that kind of opportunity and this film fails to grasp the fundamentals of living a life as a quadriplegic. It's not fluff movie making, but the character is not too believable and neither is the story. Overall, it's worth watching. Hrithik Roshan does a great job with the material that he is given. Unlike most Bollywood actors, he is not lazy and does not take the easy way out.
