I really enjoyed this movie. It dramatizes a doomed winter journey over the Sierra Nevadas as a group of settlers look to reach the safety and warmth of California. Based on a true story, "The Donner Party" successfully depicts the hopelessness and desperation caused by the tremendous obstacles these people faced. This character based film stars Crispin Glover who delivers a terrificly subdued intensity as the party leader. I'm a big fan and it was nice to see him again! The up close life and death struggle depicted is contrasted by some beautiful terrain shots which creates a nice balance in the film. A very believable world was created on camera and this story will suck you in. I have read the reviews from the history buffs, the vocal minority who oppose the dramatization of these events and I don't agree. This isn't a documentary, it's a "based on..." movie and it captures a essence of a fascinating story set in a period of american history that is seldom depicted in modern movies. Watch this film!
