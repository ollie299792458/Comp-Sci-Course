The VeggieTales will always be a great family tradition! However, with my children now in their teenage years, they are really getting into the live drama, with period costumes and ancient traditions. Overall, the stoylines are right in line with the scriptures, although for time reasons they did condense a few things. The personalites are at the directors discretion, but given the culture at the time, I believe the direction was spot on. The acting is wonderful...how can you go wrong with Ben Kingsly?! As potifer, he was both compassionate and stern, and as Moses...well, I had to get used to him with hair, hahha. The make-up, age progression, everything was amazing. Nothing distracted from the storyline, other than a few "bad acting' spots from supporting actors. Oh and there was a very provocative bath scene with Joseph and Potifers wife...fast forwarding is a good option there.

Each of the stories take take place with great understanding of the ancient culture and traditions. As well, these movies help to clarify the generations ...who was the father of whom, and how they are all related. The videos develop well knowm Bible personalities into real people, which makes identifying with them easier for those of us who like "visual clarification". My whole family has truly enjoyed these videos. You know it's a great movie when your teenager says "Do the scriptures really say that?". And you can open up your Bible and say..."Yep, here in Exodus 9. Will you read it to us?". You get the idea =)  Now, get the set. It's well worth the money.
