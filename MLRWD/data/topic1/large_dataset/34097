This movie was good, with a few caveats. Some major flaws include the mismatched guns that were all wrong for the period, including the opening scene where our hero is carrying a Marlin 1894 at the end of the civil war. And in one scene they are carrying nickel Colt 1873 Peacemakers (a cartridge pistol) and in the next scene they are front stuffing the cylinders of their blued revolvers with black powder. Another minor irritation is that the character spends a lot of the movie wearing a black leather jacket but black leather didn't come around until the early 20th century with the advent of chrome tanning; up until then leather was vegetable tanned in various shades of brown. But movies are all about the suspension of disbelief, right? Once I let go of these minor flaws I really enjoyed it. As the title of my review suggests it bears some thematic similarities to The Outlaw Josey Wales, except for the walking dead. This story was more about the spiritual journey than your typical zombie shred-fest, but it's a worthy addition to my collection of zombie documentaries.
