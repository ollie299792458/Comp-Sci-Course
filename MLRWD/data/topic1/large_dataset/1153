I saw the Moody Blues on tour in summer of 2011. This concert video released in 2006 is my one avenue to try and relive that night. It is very close to the same line up of supporting members. Many of the same songs I saw in 2011 are also performed in this 2006 concert, of course.

There are some songs that the Moody Blues perform live that I definitely prefer over the studio recorded versions - Just A Singer In A Rock and Roll Band, Ride My See Saw, Higher and Higher, The Other Side of Life, and especially Question. These songs just absolutely sizzle when they're performed live and this 2006 concert video has splendid, high energy renditions of them.

I have other live concert footage such as the Red Rocks Canyon 1992 concert. I enjoy this 2006 concert more because it's higher quality on several points:

* Justin Hayward unfortunately was having a problem with his voice the night of the Red Rocks concert recording (his voice is in top form on this 2006 DVD despite being 14 years older)
* The audio recording quality of the 2006 video is much better
* The quality of the video is likewise much higher in the 2006 concert footage
* The 2006 video is in 16x9 widescreen whereas my Red Rocks video is in the out-moded 4x3 full screen format
* The energy of performance is excellent throughout the 2006 video; Red Rocks less even

One item of note that is in itself a personal justification for purchasing this 2006 concert video is the live performance of the 2003 song December Snow. I love this song and think it's one of Justin's best. There's no where else to go to see this song performed live. (Alas, it was not performed in the 2011 Precious Cargo tour line up of songs.)

In 2011 Graeme Edge is now 70 years old. In this 2006 concert you'll see him a few years younger and in very top form as he leads the band in the performance of his Higher and Higher song from the To Our Children's Children's Children 1969 album.

That's what is wondrous about this 2006 concert DVD - it's amazing to see this band, that has been together since 1966/67 (sadly now minus both Mike Pinder and Ray Thomas), delivering such a dazzling performance. (Please, I'm not counting here the Denny Laine time frame - musically was a completely different band then.)

Probably for a lot of fans, seeing Justin Hayward put his heart and soul and guitar expertise into the near anthem song of the Moody Blues, Question, is worth the price of the "admission". I especially enjoy the jam songs where Justin Hayward and John Lodge close ranks together on their respective guitars - seeing their delight becomes our delight.

One more note: I first downloaded this concert from iTunes - that is a highly abreviated version of the concert that is edited down to 53 minutes. This video DVD or Blue Ray disk has about twice as much footage and has interviews with the band members. Ignore the online version and go straight for the DVD or Blue Ray version of this concert.
