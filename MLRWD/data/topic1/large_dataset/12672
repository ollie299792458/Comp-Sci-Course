Let's face it; Jodie Foster does not make bad movies.  Perhaps the greatest actress of her generation, Foster had been MIA while she was birthing her babies, and "Panic Room" was a welcome return for this superb thespian.  That being said, the movie isn't without it's problems.  The set-up of the plot is too rushed, and the action itself, while often high-octane, goes on too long to truly be enjoyable. In other words, too little development and too much melodrama.  For fans of the female-driven action genre, however, the movie is actually quite enjoyable, if a bit high-strung.  Foster is, as usual, incomparable, and Forest Whitaker provides his trademark low-key delivery.  Any movie that keeps a mask on Dwight Yoakam for long periods of time can only be a good thing, and he proves here that he's adept at playing incarnate evil.  Jared Leto's performance is surprisingly lacking the thoughtfulness he usually offers, as he seems to do nothing but scream and whine throughout the entire movie looking like he needs a good power-washing.  
All and all a decent movie made stronger by Foster's performance.  Recommended as long as you don't go into it with high expectations.
