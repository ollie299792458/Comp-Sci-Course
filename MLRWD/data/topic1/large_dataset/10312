I loved watching the Road Warriors wrestle. In fact, my fondest memory that made me a die-hard wrestling fan was when the Road Warriors took the spike to Dusty Rhode's eye. I can saw that it was that moment, sitting downstairs in front of the television that I became a true wrestling fan. The DVD is a two disk set. The first disk is an entire 2 hours of listening to Animal tell the history of the team and if you actually want to see some of the early matches, skip into the extras, because that is the only place you will see them along with some of the Warriors promos. I found some of the other extras to be very weak and uninteresting. Who really wants to sit through Micheal Hayes, with a very bad goatee, I think he was trying to look french, I don't know. Anyways, did I really need to hear him telling me that if I wished to be a tag team wrestler, to watch the dvd that I just watched? That cost this disk one star. Otherwise, I liked the disk. But then I remember when wrestling was fun to watch and we all wondered if it was real.
