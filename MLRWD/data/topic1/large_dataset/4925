Well, this is the best film-score ever written! I have not heard anything like this ever, I were totally blown out of my chair when I listened to this score for the first time! 
The score offers 50 minutes with intense and dramatic music. The London Symphony Orchestra creates a great deal of noise along with the London Voices, it is unbelievable. The complexity of the great amount of themes are the key for this score, bescause each part of the large orchestra plays a different theme at the same time, making the product tremendously unbelievable great!
The Whole score is very militaristic in both brass and percussion, there is a great amount of heroic themes that would have blown Richard Strauss away if he heard this. But also in some tracks, the material are very soft making melodic genuine mood of era. 
I highly recommend this score for everyone, it is in my opinion the greatest score imaginable and I can't hear it without believing that I'm a pirate!! I can almost smell the salt air and hear the blood-curling shouts as I listen to this score! 
FANTASTIC!
