I'm a romantic myself, so hey, what can I say? 
I don't believe Julia Roberts is the prettiest actress I have ever seen, but she's certainly one of the best and the chemistry between her and Hugh Grant is perfect. You  get the feeling the parts were written with them in mind (which, from  reading the notes on the DVD, I have found is actually the case with Hugh  Grant).
In a world full of madness and cruelty, every heart seeks peace,  love, tenderness and stability. World-famous actress Anna Scott (portrayed  by Julia Roberts) finds all this and more in William Thacker (Hugh Grant),  the simple, kind-hearted owner of a travel-book shop on Notting Hill,  London. But how is their relationship to progress in the frenzy that makes  up the life of a multi-million dollar a film movie-star? Do they even stand  a chance? You bet they do! Love overcomes all, and that's exactly what we  want, yes, even need to see and believe in, isn't it?
There are not just  moments of tenderness between Will and Anna, but also between Will's  friends, who stick by him through all the turbulent waters of this not so  simple relationship. For instance, the scenes where Max carries his lovely  but crippled wife Bella up the stairs to bed or insists that she takes part  in the wild car race to the Ritz are full of warmth. If you like romantic  comedies, see this movie!
The DVD itself is excellently manufactured and  full of goodies. Get it!
