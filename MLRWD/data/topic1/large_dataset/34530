If I have to summarize my review in just a few words, it's got to be Wow and again WOW! This lady is a gift from God and her voice just permeates through your whole being. I have to admit I was not an Adele fan before and I bought this disc more for the hype surrounding her chart topping songs. But boy, am I glad I did. To say I was blown away is an understatement; I felt like I was there among the audience at the Royal Albert cheering her on, finding myself totally drawn in by her powerful voice and I also felt an emotional connection. There are so many songs in the disc that appeals to me like I'll Be Waiting, Set Fire To The Rain (and I haven't heard those songs before this) but the icing on the cake got to be the last two numbers - Someone Like You and Rolling In The Deep. This blu-ray is worth every dime just for those songs and as a bonus, you even get a CD of the songs to play in your car. And how can you improve on such an awesome performance? By producing a 3D version and the option of having the lyrics on the screen.
