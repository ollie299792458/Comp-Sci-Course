I am from NY, and yes like all big cities, we have CHINA TOWN. When I saw FLOWER DRUM SONG,I was eight years old, I knew that when I grew up I would go there. yes I love that movie. Aside from being musical, it was funny romantic and serious in certain parts a huge pagage, I am here to say that at that time in the sixties that is how it was excluding the music in the streets, unles it was their holiday. it was run only by the asians..restaurants, police, and so on. to go there was like walking in a different world, a world that i love, and miss going..so yhea unless you was married in the family and you was not an asian whould be the only reason you whould be there. I love all the music sung in this movie..It made me feel happy inside.
but that's me, I love romance with a twist. I have seen movies from all the actors after "FLOWER DRUM SONG" all have done great movies, but I'm partial to the ladies, they were acting till very old...and still beautifull..still standing tall...YOU GO GIRLS. sadly all the men are gone eccept for the younger ones. "FLOWER DRUM SONG" A BLAST FROM THE PAST
