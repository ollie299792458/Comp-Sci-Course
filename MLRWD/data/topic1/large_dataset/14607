I also remember seeing this in the Theaters when I was a kid.  Then a couple of times on TV in the mid 80s.

I had long since forgotten about it.  Then a few years ago - tracked it downa nd bought a copy.

This movie came out around the same time as TRON.  Yes - as mentioned it was low-budget so not kicking the special effects.  They at elast were close - if not a step behind what the Buck Rogers and first Battlestar Galactica Series had a few yeras prior.

But I must have gotten a "bad copy" of it or something (yes I bought a clean licensed offical copy from a legitimate source) because the editing of the storyline sucked like a vacuum cleaner.  Yes - I can pick out the & Samurai aspect to it (hell - Star Wars does that) but many many moments in the movie that change from one scene to the next leaving you askign WTF and how ddid they get to that point ?  So you mentally have to fill in a wide gap trying to understand the direction of the film.

But here ytou all are 40Â± something people giving this title raving reviews - probably mostly because you all are holding onto the child-hood memories like I had from all those years ago and not really watching it objectively for what it is - low-budget garbage.

The only "fond" memory I still have of this movie is the look of the ship (and the cockpit / controls).

To the folks who have never seen this movie - if you are into low-budget crap-cut storyline knock offs - then this is a great title to check out.  IF NOT - then do not waste your brain power on the time it takes you to consume this title as it would be better spent elsewhere doing almost anything else.
