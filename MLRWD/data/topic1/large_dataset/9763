Good grief.  Vikings were certainly as mean and nasty as , say, the Mongols, though I think for body count of innocent victims the Mongols would win hands ( feet, and heads ) down.

After 15 years this boy remembers his native tongue perfectly.  He also managed somehow to learn expert swordsmanship and Viking style fighting by the age of 7 or so....all of which he remembered as he practiced by himself over the years.

The movie answered once and for all the question of nature vs. nurture.  I realize most video gamers never heard these terms or understands what they mean.  It's mostly nurture it turns out.

This movie is definitely entertaining.  I learned a lot.  I didn't know more Vikings appeared as the original ones were killed off....no matter the attrition rate up until the end their numbers stayed pretty constant...spontaneous generation of full grown full of hate Vikings?  Maybe.

I also would never have guessed that Vikings were in the game just to kill and maim etc etc.  I thought they were after loot too....but nothing seems to interest them as they rummage around villages they as they destroy them.

I was also surprised that the Vikings would cross giant mountain ranges just to kill easy to kill natives....and come to think of it why didn't the natives loot the wrecked Viking ship for swords and other useful stuff?  Like maybe portable GPS gear?  I mean, your average gamer probably doesn't realize they didn't have such technology.

Anyone who takes this movie as seriously factual is in need of further education if he/she is over ten years of age.  It's great fun and worth ten bucks.  Glad I didn't pay more.  If you want to learn anything about native american culture, viking culture, or history you best not get this movie.  If you know anything about these things keep it to yourself as you watch....

And just exactly what breed of dog did those natives have??????
