The 1950 version of "King Solomon's Mines" deserves a full 5 stars if only for one reason--it is one of the few movies even to this day which is set in Africa, filmed in Africa, and features actual Africans portraying Africans.  In particular, the dance scene near the end almost has the quality of an ethnographic film, and is worth watching in itself because the lead dancer is one of the finest you will ever see.

While it is true that this movie is barely the same story as the H. Rider Haggard novel, that can only be a good thing, as the book is racist and unbelievably sexist even by 19th century standards.  The plot is indeed full of adventure, but there were several points where the descriptions of game hunting (without even taking the trophies!  for literally no reason!) made me nauseous.  By all means, read it and get a taste of 19th century British attitudes toward their colonies.  It ain't pretty, by today's standards.

Whether you love or hate the plot of the movie, this film is, in its way, a little piece of history.  It's true the African actors aren't the main stars of the movie (though some of them are so charismatic they steal their scenes).  But lest we forget, in 1932, only 18 years before, Edward G. Robinson and Loretta Young, and Boris Karloff and Myrna Loy all played Chinese people (in "The Hatchet Man" and "The Mask of Fu Manchu" respectively) because God forbid Hollywood would actually cast Chinese actors.  It would be a long time before an African or African-American actor would be considered a big enough star to draw mainly white audiences, but "KSM" was a step in the right direction and it's a lot more engrossing movie because of it.
