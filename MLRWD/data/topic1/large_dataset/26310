This film may lose some luster on TV when compared to what was shown at the theater. But you will love the effects on this film; you may even get a little seasick. You may know what I mean about seeing some movies on big TV and how it will lose some of its effect on the TV screen. Just think of "Titanic" or "Saving Private Ryan". One knock on the film coming from critics that I don't think it deserves is that they are saying there really isn't any deep character developments.  Well how much deep character development is there with fishermen?  These are men who work their tails off in terrible working conditions and do it only because...well we got to pay the bills. I thought they were excellent characters because they were just plain ole folks trying to make a living.  The sea is their life, and it has ruined some of their lives with divorces and separation from their kids. They go to work and it's good bye for a month! Not "I'll see ya at dinner time when I get home today from work.", but "I'll see ya around August when I get back", if they get back. Besides the real meat of the film is the storm and man is it really something to behold. The film is slightly choppy in story just like the sea in that they switch from one thing to the next. We are on the Andrea Gail fighting the rough seas, and it will cut away to the Coast Guard rescuing a sailboat, and then back at the Port of Massachusetts with family, friends, and girlfriends worrying about their loved ones.  Other than that the movie still works as a whole really well. Really neat effects with the storm waves scene once the movie picks up. I read the book a few weeks ago and the film follows closely without the detail of course. I love that book and if you don't see the movie I highly recommend reading it. I'll close for now and take care film fans.
