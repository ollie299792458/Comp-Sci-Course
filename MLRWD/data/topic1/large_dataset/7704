I must admit, I had seen all the bad reviews, and had drawn back from watching this movie. I now know that THAT was a mistake! It may be a guilty pleasure, but I found this charming, with a wonderful sense of the use of the songs of ABBA that I've loved for years. Yes, it is a little over the top -- but when was the last time you watched "An American in Paris?" I re-watched it lately, and talk about over the top! But IT WORKS and is considered a classic. That's because the MUSIC works. The same could be said for "Mama Mia". Maybe not on the same level -- ABBA is not on par with Gershwin, after all -- but they never pretended to be, either.

I knew Meryl Streep could sing (she does it very well in "A Prairie Home Companion" and "Postcards from the Edge"), but Colin Firth surprised me pleasantly. And could anything be funnier (or campier) than Christine Baranski's "Does Your Mother Know?" And I certainly cannot remember a more unique (or funnier) dance sequence than is in "Lay All Your Love On Me!"

I'm well over 50, so I remember those clothes, those awful platform shoes, and how the music critics savaged ABBA as being "cotton candy" music. So ignore the critics. This movie will bring back some happy memories (if you are as old as I am!), and make some new ones!
