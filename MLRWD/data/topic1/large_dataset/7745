"Barry Lyndon" seems to have taken a back seat to films such as "2001" and "a Clockwork Orange" whenever the subject of "great" SK films is raised. That is unfortunate because I believe this an excellent film  in just about every respect:  a compelling and witty story (it's really a comedy more than anything else), beautiful sets and locations, costumes and lush cinematography  are among its many delights. Despite the three hour length and relaxed pacing Kubrick's assured direction and the strong performances preclude any sense of boredom. I saw and enjoyed this film when it was released in 1975 and enjoyed it even more in 2002. I'm only sorry I waited so long to see it again. The DVD remastering is superb-everything looks clear and vibrant. My only quibble is with the score which won an Oscar for "best adapted score". Kubrick's one great weakness IMO is that he seemed to think that his recurrent practice of  stitching together bits of classical music (i.e. "2001" et al)  was superior to hiring a professional composer to produce  tailor made scores-  and this already great film could have been greater still, had he hired John Williams, Alex North, Jerry Goldsmith or any number of other fine composers to enhance "Barry Lyndon".
Highly Recommended
