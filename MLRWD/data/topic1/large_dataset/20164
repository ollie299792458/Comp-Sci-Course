This film is a representation of the old goddess (i.e. pagan) traditions and contains such themes as an immolated god, mother goddess and the birth, death and ressurection of her son. Regarding previous comments, the film  does not have anything to do with the Necronomicon (a work of fiction) or  with Christianity save for the pagan influences on the religion. If you are  interested in the raw imagery of earlier religious traditions, this film  shows them very powerfully. The timing, as with most works of surrealism is  a bit off and trying, but well worth the effort. This film is not meant as  a comedy or horror show,  but a revelation of the cycle of life viewed  through ancient mythologies: Ishtar and her husbands, Osiris, Dionysus,  Persephone and Demeter to name but a very few of the very many examples of  this archetype. Definitely a challenge to orthodox opinions, especially  those which deny the impact of goddess traditions on Judaism and  Christianity. Anyone interested, might check out Merlin Stone's "When  God Was A Woman" for a scholarly work which examines the goddess  oriented traditions of the Middle East which preceded Jusaism and  Christiniaty, and on which this film is based. Begotten is powerful and  haunting, touching on the deepest levels of our collective memory. Love it  or hate it, its symbolism will stay with you for quite some time.
