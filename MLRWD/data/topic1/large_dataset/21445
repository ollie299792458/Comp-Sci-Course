OK, here we go. As far as a sequel goes this movie should be considered the truest sequel of the series & SST2 should be burned & forgotten. This movie is pretty good if you are a fan of the original. Yet keep in mind the original is with out a doubt the best by far. The story line in this movie is pretty good, I was surprised by that. At first I thought that I was not going to get into the film but as the story unfolded I found myself loving the movie. It is corny in all the right ways. It is a satire of our lives today militarily, politically & religiously. It pokes fun at the mindless followers in todays society and mirrors the Iraq War issue plus the religion & state issue. I really liked where they took the film.

Now then, as far as the special effects goes, they are second rate. The props & bugs look fake but who cares. This movie reminds me of the old B budget sci-fi & horror films. Once you get into the story & start getting to know the characters you begin to over look the special effects. I did like the blood & guts though, just the right amount not to mention the pointless nudity. All in all the second rate, fake looking CGI special effects tend to add to the satyrical, corniness of the movie. If you are a fan then get it, you will like it. I did.
