This film stays true to the original film and then some.  Tim Sullivan was able to incorporate so many different elements into the story with having a tight budget and like 17 days to shoot it.  It's awesome to see Robert Englund making a fart joke and then in a bad ass fight scene later on.  This film covers all ends of the spectrum which I feel most other don't.  In most movies, characters have an inner base that you discover as the film goes on...but in Maniacs, every character wears there personality on their sleeve.  There is really nothing to figure out through each character because they're "SUPPOSED TO BE OVER THE TOP".  That's the way the original was and I applaud Tim Sullivan and company for sticking to that premise.  I mean the film is supposed to be predictable...it's not supposed to be like a lame ass M. Night Schayamalan film where it revolves around the twist at the end.  This film has "cult classic" written all over it.  People just need to understand that it is a joke and supposed to crude, wacky, and goofy.
