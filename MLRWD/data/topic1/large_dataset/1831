Believe it or not, I'm writing this review having just watched the film on my circa 1984 CED disk player! I've just joined the 21st century and will be getting the DVD.

The richness of color in this film is in my mind unparalelled in any other I've ever seen. Everything shimmers, from the blue of the Mediterranean in the Monte Carlo scenes, to the deep red of Moira Shearer's hair. Even on my CED disk.

If the production values weren't so incredible, and the ballet so beautifully done, this would frankly be just another weepy romance. But everything in the film is interpolated to perfection to advance the story and illustrate the deeper psychological workings of the characters' minds.

Two points which occurred to me from other reviewers: 1) Favorite quote "Even the best magician can't pull a rabbit from a hat if there isn't already a rabbit in the hat" 2) Vicky Page destroys her life when she cannot make the decision between dancing and her life. Moira Shearer left dancing at 27 and lost plum movie assignments later ("Hans Christian Andersen" for instance when she became pregnant) because she would not be separated from her family.

Anyway, if you haven't got it by now, this is a magnificent film, something the entire family can enjoy together and should be part of every movie owner's library.
