I picked this movie up because Matthew Perry and Mary Steenburgen almost always deliver but this was one was a real disappointment.  Matthew Perry's character is experiencing a period of depersonalization and life has gone flat - no highs, no lows.  Unfortunately, the movie suffered from the same condition.  He's depressed and he's looking for answers - along the way, he discovers a beautiful girl.  Perry's character goes from one condescending therapist to another and that could be funny...but it isn't.  The interactions with his family should add something to the plot but it really doesn't.  He even breaks up with the beautiful girl and that should provide some anti-climax, but it doesn't. A little ways into the movie, Perry's character steals a pen from the drug store - the kleptomania  is only a device that is needed in the break-up scene; it doesn't really get explained or resolved once it is no longer necessaryto the plot. A couple of nude shots and a ton of uses of the "F-word" are thrown in to try to keep the audience from going numb but it's like trying to revive a dying patient by sticking their tongue between the posts of a 9-volt battery, rather than using a defibrillator.

The movie kept reminding me of a couple of Bill Murray movies - "Lost in Translation" and "Broken Flowers" and I'm just not sure we really need one more movie about a jaded, self-absorbed person shuffling blandly through the lives of those around him.
