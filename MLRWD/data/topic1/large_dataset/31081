Willie (Billy Bob Thorton) plays no other than Santa himself, but in this film he plays a rude Santa who is a drunk and a sex fiend. Now in this film (if you have not seen it, have you been living under a rock?), Willie and his little friend Marcus (Tony Cox) go around the country posing as Santa and a elf at malls stealing them blind on Christmas Eve escaping until next Christmas, but this year...things do not go as plan: Willie beriends a local boy named Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly)a sexy bartender (the hot Lauren Graham) while being investigated by the department store detective (Bernie Mac) thanks to Bob (the late John Ritter) the manager for letting the department store manager know about Willie and Marcus.

 Eventually the department detective finds out about their sceme, so he wants in on it. Willie and Marcus are against it because he wants half of everything including the merchandise they steal. Eventually the detective is killed in a accident and his body is dumped on the side of the road. So the plan is still in motion until something goes down between Willie and Marcus.

 Note: This movie is VERY CRUDE, and has a lot of adult languange and adult situations and it is NOT FOR KIDS. If you are easily offended, do not even bother seeing this film because this is black comedy at it's finest.
