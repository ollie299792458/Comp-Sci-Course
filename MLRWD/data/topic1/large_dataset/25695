In the canon of so-bad-they're-amazing movies, "The Apple" ranks somewhere in the vicinity of "Howard the Duck" and "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians." The story is somewhat an amalgam of "Phantom of the Paradise" (its Faustian elements and music-industry satire), "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" (ditto, and "The Apple" is much better), "Xanadu" (pop cheese circa 1980), "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" (the camp, the glam, and the tight shiny underwear), "Hair" (the hippies) and John Huston's "The Bible" (seems to be inspired by the Adam/Eve story as interpreted by Huston). It's 86 minutes long, which is about the proper duration for a movie like this. The costumes are so mind-bogglingly over-the-top, as both the elaborate and the underwear seem to have cost about the same. The performances and writing are horrendous, but kudos to Vladek Sheybal and Ray Shell for acknowledging they're in a movie that's supposed to be trashy. Miriam Margolyes also has a hilarious (if stereotypical) supporting role as a landlady. This is the kind of movie that begs to be watched and simultaneously mocked and celebrated. You must watch it in widescreen format, for the full effect of the money that was spent on it (no B-level schlock is this!) One quibble: the trailer features material not in the actual movie. "The Apple" has everything: the good, the bad... and the gaudy.
