I really enjoyed this movie the first time i saw it... which happened to be this year. The only reason i saw it so late was because no one would give me a straight answer as to what it was about. Finally a co-worker who is also one of "the best f-ing cash-man's that ever lived" told me what it was about and coerced me to buy the movie. I freaking watched it that night, even though i had final in my social-psych class the next day. I tryed to study for a while, but the movie took me in, and reminded me so much of how work was for me. I hate customers, but what am i going to do about it. The thing Randal says about working would be great if there were no customers is soo true. Another thing this movie points out is how many things can happen in one day, its amazoning; i've never seen such a sequential movie like this before. 
One thing i'm glad he left out was that alternate ending, it would have made the movie so bleak, and alot less likely for people to get into. It would have really dragged the movie down if he kept it in.
