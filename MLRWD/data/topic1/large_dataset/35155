I can not believe this movie did not get more attention ! I was blown away at how all around good this was!
Granted it unfortunately came out after the wonderful Capote and I admit I did not see it at the movies, which is actually a blessing because I would have missed out on the completely engrossing and informative directors commentary! Do not skip that! After you see the movie and the complex meanings have seeped into your consciousness, watch that commentary.
The actor Toby who channeled Capote was mesmerizing. He became Truman, was not simply mimicing.
Sandra Bullock was excellent, absolutely, as was Daniel Craig, Sigourney Weaver, Isabella Rossalini, Jeff Daniels, Juliette Stevenson,Peter Bogdanovich.... Oh! And Gwenyth Paltrow beautifully sang a cole porter song (which was a very telling scene...as explained by the director)
I do not want to give anything away, and I am sure other reviewers have summarized the plot line...but from the writing, to the acting, to the set designs, the music, the costumes, the period feel, the emotional twists of human achievement versus human cruelty...this is a film that is worth experiencing.
Again, make sure to watch the director's commentary!
