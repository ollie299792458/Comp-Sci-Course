This movie has been caught in crossfire of its own.  The "Custer scholars" belittle it because of historical inaccuracies while the "politically correct" denounce it as a lionization of Custer.  Folks should realize this is nothing more than an entertaining historical novel transferred to the silver screen.  Please keep in mind this was made in 1942 - during Hollywood's Golden Age and at the start of the U.S. entry into WWII.  Movie makers weren't interested in giving history lessons, but providing entertainment pure and simple.  They made movies as a form of escapism (remember the timeframe this was made) AND to get people into the theaters buying popcorn.  These "novels" also helped to define the best in heroes - whether these heroes were manufactured or not.  There is no other way to put it - approach this "action-and-romance" movie with the notion of being thoroughly entertained - and you will not be disappointed!  This movie is so good; I did not even knock off stars for the quality of the discs themselves.  I had to try 3 different merchants and return several DVDs before I had one that did not freeze or skip.  4 of the discs I exchanged all froze in the same places (scenes 23-25).  The flick is DEFINITELY worth the hassles and the price, though.  ENJOY!
