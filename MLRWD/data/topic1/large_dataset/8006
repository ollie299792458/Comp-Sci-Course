This (movie) is what you think it is. If you are a fan of Bruce Campbell. If you always stop as you're channel surfing whenever "Army of Darkness" is on. If you watch "Burn Notice" as much for BC as for everyone else in the cast - yes, incluing Gabrielle Anwar. If you miss "Brisco County, Jr." and have been thinking, "Damn, why don't I just go ahead and by the series on DVD, already?!". Then this little treat is PERFECT for you.

It's funny, over-the-top, references all (or at least 90%) of your BC favorites, has some Fake Shemps, and at about $20 is a good value as any American can find nowadays.

It's much better than "The Man with the Screaming Brain" - yes, I actually did see that in a theater (BC was there for a book signing...and maybe I was drunk...that's all I'm gonna say, so drop it).

Want some artsy film? Look elsewhere. Want a movie about two cowboys in love? Or some long-lost lovers reunited after being separated during a war? Well. I think the Lifetime Channel is playing your song, Nancy Boy.

So, while the world around us is rapidly going to Hell in a handbasket and the Feds are blowin' through your grandkid's incomes like a bunch of drunken sailors, set yourself down, grab a beer (or 20) and lose yourself in BC's world.

Buy this movie - watch this movie - be proud that you own this movie.
