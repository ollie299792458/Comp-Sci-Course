When I was shopping for this video, I read several negative reviews.  As someone who is a novice, and simply wanted to know more about the band, and see them perform, this is what I have to say;

First off, you have to understand that this was shot on or before 1977.  There is no surround sound.  The video at times is grainy, and some parts are in black and white.

But you know what?  I thought this video kicked ass!  What I saw was a bunch of young guys barely in their 20s having the time of their lives up on the stage.  Not only that, the music rocked!  I played it through my home theater system, and I loved it!

The only thing negative about this video was realizing that almost all of the band members are now dead.  Not because of the plane crash...that only killed 2 band members and one of the back up singers.  The rest died from various causes.  But what a loss.

If you like Lynyrd Skynyrd, believe me, you will not be disappointed by this video.  If you're not sure if you like them, you will after seeing this!  I consider this video one of the crown jewels in my music video collection.
