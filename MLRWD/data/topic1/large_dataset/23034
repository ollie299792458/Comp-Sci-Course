Warning: This review might contain spoilers.  The 2003 version of "The Italian Job" is a great example of what a modern day action film contains.  It has villains, heroes, gun battles, car chases, great camera work, and of course a beautiful woman.  This film stands out on any list of action films and is an excellent movie.

This movie really has little in common with its 1969 predecessor, other than the fact that gold is stolen with the help of Mini Coopers.  However, this more modern version still manages to upend its earlier version.  The advancements in technology make the camera angles more impressive and much more interesting, while the idea of high tech tools make the characters the envy of modern males.

Seth Green steals every scene.  As the geeky computer hacker Lyle, Green manages to create a true geek image and brings a new level to the parody of the geek.  As he helps the thieves hack the computer systems necessary for the job, he constantly flashes back to his college days where he claims to be the real maker of Napster.

The casting is perfect.  Mark Wahlberg plays the leading role of hero Charlie Croker.  Edward Norton, who does a great job making his character disliked, takes on the villain role.  Charlize Theron plays the role of beautiful woman, Stella Bridger.  Charlize does an excellent job with this role and this is the best she has looked in one of her films.

In Conclusion, F. Gary Gray's version of "The Italian Job" is superior compared to its predecessor.  This movie updates all of the elements from 1969, which are now obsolete.  The film is well done and the new twist on a well-known plot is appreciated and creates a new classic.
