Since this is 2008, you have probably seen From Russia with Love.  If not, seek out one of the other hundreds of reviews here that talk about the plot points, set pieces and Sean Connery.  They can fill you in better than I can.  What I will concentrate on is this new Blu-Ray release.  Having owned just about every other version of this movie (Beta [Yes Beta...I blame my Dad for that], VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD), I can easily say this high-def release is the best.  If you also own this movie on another format and are waffling about buying the Blu-Ray release, do it...especially if you are a Bond fan.

On a HDTV you will "see" this movie for the first time.  I started picking out extras in the background and details on Sean Connery's clothing that I had never noticed before.  When you watch Q make his entrance and go over Bond's attach&eacute; case, check out how smoke stained Desmond Llewelyn's hands are.  It really is amazing and makes you appreciate the movie on a whole new level.

With a nice DTS 5.1 soundtrack and a slew of extras, this will be a great addition to your Blu-Ray collection.  I know it is to mine.
