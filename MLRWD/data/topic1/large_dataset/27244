I should mention I bought this from the "New and Used" link getting it brand new for 20 dollars.

This set contains four movies
High Sierra (1941)
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)
They Drive By Night (1940)
Casablanca (1942)

The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is the same as the one provided in the link, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXD5">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>  This is a 20 dollar value.

Casablanca is the same as the one provided in the link, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W0WM">Casablanca (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>  Another 20 dollar value.

Both High Sierra and They Drive by Night are in the thin DVD cases, not the full size that are the norm.

High Sierra is one of Bogie's first leading roles. This film along with The Maltese Falcon made Bogie a star.  It is also the last film in which he does not have top billing.

He is in a supporting roll in They Drive by Night.  For those thinking that Bogie has a major roll in this film do not be mislead.  His roll is a supporting roll with his screen time diminishing as they film progresses.  However this film will give you a glimpse of George Raft and Ida Lupino acting skills.

This set is worth it even if you only want to own Treasure and Casablanca, with two other Bogie films included.
