I was advised by a friend that the five-hour televised version of this masterpiece was available on  DVD.  I immediately got a copy of this wonderful set and watched the 'Prelude' and 'Act I' of this series.  This expanded version (happily available in the US as part of the Criterion film series), sheds more light and detail on the themes that Bergman showed in his movie version.  As the well-crafted commentary booklet indicates, Bergman was not thrilled about sacrificing those details. In Act I, I loved Oskar's colorful story of an old chair in the nursery and the more detailed depictions of the other characters of this act.  I am looking forward to seeing the subsequent acts, including those scenes at the stark and bare Bishop's home and Alexander's attempts to excape from those realities.

This box set does contain the original movie as well as a disk that has various commentaries on the film and TV series.  For those who have not seen Fanny and Alexander (The film was shown over twenty years ago and the TV series was not yet available in the US), this set is a must; the film, alhough good, does not give Bergman's story full justice as the TV series does.  Bravo to Criterion for its foresight in getting this set out to a new generation of film lovers.  The transfer to DVD is superb.
