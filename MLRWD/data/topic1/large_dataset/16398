Film Backround: Sleeping Beauty is a 1959 animated film produced by Walt Disney and based on the fairy tale by Charles Perrault. The film spent nearly the entire decade of the 1950s in production: the story work began in 1951, voices were recorded in 1952, animation production took from 1953 until 1958, and the musical score, mostly based on Tchaikovsky's ballet of the same name, was recorded in 1957. Sleeping Beauty's production costs, which totaled $6 million, made it the most expensive Disney film up to that point, and over twice as expensive as each of the preceding three Disney animated features. Sleeping Beauty's successful reissues have made it the second most successful film released in 1959, second to Ben-Hur.
