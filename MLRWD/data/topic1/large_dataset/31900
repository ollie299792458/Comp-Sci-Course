This junk pretty much sums up all that's bad about Japanese horror flims.Personally, I have yet to watch an impressive J-horror flick, but some were at least entertaining. Actually , this one can be entertaining too if you're in the mood to see just how bad such films can get. From the beginning , it's  pure cheese - some water dripping from the ceiling, ghostly girl popping up everywhere along with her personal belongings and so on. And OF COURSE, it's all shrouded in a deep mystery - who the girl is, what she's doing there, blah ,blah,blah.  Sounds familiar? Well, to top it off, it's all presented in the most impressively mundane format (homage to other J-horror classics, perhaps?), so in the end it's pretty much up to your imagination (hopefully you have one, unlike this Japanese directors) to answer the above questions and figure out what exactly is going on. In other words: unless you want to show your friends just how bad J-horror can get, avoid this at all costs... damn, I hear something dripping..what the #$^& ?! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
