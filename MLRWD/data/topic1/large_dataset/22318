I needn't repeat what all the other five-star reviews have said. I share their opinions, and the five stars are for the movie. This review, however, includes specific information about the disc.

Since Amazon continues to lump all reviews of a particular movie together, it becomes impossible for a potential buyer to figure out what purchasers are referring to when they complain about the awful DVD quality or rave about the same unless the reviewer specifically states exactly what edition he's talking about. In this case, as with so many old movies, there are several to choose from. I chose the Critics' Choice version because a reviewer spoke highly of it. However, I have not seen any of the others, so I can't compare.

As for this particular edition, it's really pretty good, considering that the movie was treated poorly for decades. However, it is not -- as the case states -- "restored". It may very well be -- and I suspect it is -- remastered from fair to good prints, but that's not restoration. There are the usual light "ticks", dirt specks, scratches and so on that one nearly always finds on old films that have not been restored (and even some that have not had a complete restoration), but they are no more distracting than they would be on any old movie that you watch on late night television.

There's nothing on the disc except for the movie itself: no chapter selection, no subtitles, zip. But this is not, after all, Criterion.

And don't freak when the movie opens and you see how bad the titles are. As with "And Then There Were None", they put their time and effort into bringing the movie back from the brink and left the title sequence as it was. The movie is in considerably better condition than the title sequence.
