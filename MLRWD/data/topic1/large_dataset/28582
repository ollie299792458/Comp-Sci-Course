What exactly happened here?  Where'd the cool movie go?  I'm used to director's cuts, extended/unrated versions, etc., but this is just too much.  It even has praise of the original on the jacket.  But it's nowhere close.  There's no voiceover.  Kris Kristofferson doesn't show up, but we get an offscreen voice of a main character in the outfit.  Everyone seems two-dimensional:  Man with gun shoots people.  How original.  And remember how Blu-ray was supposed to make everything better, with unlimited storage?  Why not give us both versions?  Instead, it's like somebody took an "alternate ending" idea and applied it to the whole film.

  Since prices have come down, it seems Hollywood has become its own worst enemy vis-a-vis Blu-ray.  You can't get the movies that would most benefit (IMHO) from hi-def:  Jurassic Park, Armageddon, Saving Private Ryan, etc.  But hey, we can get movies that nobody wanted to see in the first place.  And now this just seems like the result of movie studio politics.  I'm sure some people will like it, but some people saw "Glitter" and "Gigli," right?
