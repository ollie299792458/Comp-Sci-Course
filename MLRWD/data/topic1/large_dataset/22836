I realize by now, we all know what A Charlie Brown Christmas is about, so I will not detail the plot for you. This blu-ray contains the entire episode, including that snowball scene devoid from earlier releases. This blu-ray also contains "It's Christmastime Again Charlie Brown" and a interesting documentary. The clarity of both cartoons, but especially the first was shocking. I knew it would look good, but not that good! I don't even have an hdmi cable, but do have 1080i. It still looks amazing. The colors are brighter and clearer than ever, you can even see slight inconsistencies in the animation, that have always been there, much better than before.

The only complaint against this blu-ray release is that they could've fit all the holiday specials on one blu-ray disc. Very true, but not every consumer is going to want each and every holiday special (in my opinion, The Halloween special is the only other special that holds a candle to the Christmas one) so it makes sense to release this special in this way.

For all those with a blu-ray player this special is definitely worth getting. 10/10!
