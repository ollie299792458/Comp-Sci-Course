Yes, Buckaroo Banzai is one of the most bizarre films I've seen and much more 'friendly' than its close relations...Liquid Sky...Eraser Head...and so on. No, Banzai is not a 'great' movie. The story is hard to follow the first 5 times. The dialog is muffled in places. And poor old Perfect Tommy keeps getting shafted! Nonetheless, it's very entertaining and I'll always love it...just not watch it every day/week/month. What's a letdown to me is that the Special Features aren't all they could be, either! The monologue by the writer staged in the Banzai Institute is incredibly boring! I couldn't believe how DULL this guy was. It was a great opportunity to explain where all the ideas came from, what it was like working with the actors, creating Rastafarian/Alien make-up...and instead he talks as if it was all real...which is silly. Why extend the joke? We get it already. I would've much preferred a more human, insightful approach instead of getting this fluffy piece of play-acting. Also, the people who designed the DVD were really, really into the car. They obviously put a lot of time into creating a computer-rendered version....which is lame. It doesn't look good and it makes me feel like I'm watching a movie aimed at 13 year old boys who think cars are neato and can't wait to learn how to drive.
