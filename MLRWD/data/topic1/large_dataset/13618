First let me say that as a former military man, I am a great fan of this movie. I am also aware that when writing a review of anything here, there are too many ad hominem attacks, and not rebuttals of the review, which make me reluctant to comment on anything. Having said that, I must admit that I am very disappointed with this Criterion issue of the Four Feathers.  I have always thought of Criterion DVDs as the best, and I thought that the blu-ray edition would be absolutely spot-on, however, that is not the case with this one.  I own an MGM edition of the film, and found it to be overall superior to that of Criterion's.  I do not know if I am just unlucky and have received a bad copy of the film, but I am going to send it back to Amazon and stay with my MGM copy.  Issues to mention:  The Criterion edition, although sharper, has a very spotty color transfer, overly bright in some places, and with some discoloration in others.  There are no subtitles in the Criterion DVD, but the MGM version has them, in several languages.  I noticed that in several parts of the film the color fades in and out, and the backgrounds appear washed up, as if the film had been colorized.  As I mentioned, please do not attack me personally for this review.  If your copy of this film is better than the one have I written about, then good for you.  I will still return the DVD to Amazon and leave it at that.  This is only one man's opinion.
