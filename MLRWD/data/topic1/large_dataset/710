If only today's mainstream horror/thriller movies could be as twisted as this. This movie is bizzare, I didn't really know what to expect from the description of the movie which said the movie was basically about a guy that rents an apartment where the previous occupant commited suicide.
The main thing that drew me to this movie was that it was directed and starred Roman Polanski, who I've always heard good things about, (except for that pedophile incident he had, that's very bad). He plays a man who tries to be good and never means harm to anyone but his world turns upside down as soon as he gets hassled by his annoying neighbors. Later on he'll be lost in his mind, not knowing who to trust, except for his love interest, the friend of the girl that commited suicide which he meets at the hospital. Story, which is based on some novel, is great because it tells you about the tragedy of a man falling victim to an unfair world. You really see and feel how insane he goes with the good story pacing. Not too much freaky stuff was given in the beginning so the movie progressed well, leaving you with more of an impact from the pyschological mess the main character is in.
There's a few humorous parts but it's mostly dark and dramatic. I highly suggest this film for anyone that wants a horror film with depth. There isn't any gore or graphic violence, just a good old freaky story that will keep you on your seat wandering how the main character will react to all his thoughts, assuming you're not too impatient with story's pacing.
