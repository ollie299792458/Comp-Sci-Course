Disney's "Bambi' is a feast for the eyes, and ears. The soundtrack is one of a kind and fits the entire movie like a glove. Bambi, the title character, is actually the least amusing character in the movie, but he is surrounded by lots of vast loveable characters, especially in Thumper the rabbit, and of course Flower the skunk which befriend him in the Disney forest.
The scenery almost outdoes mother nature herself in lush sequences and forest shades of green color. The animation is first rate, and true Disney followers all know the extent animators went in the day to portray true feelings of live animals in this picture.
The musical score is surprisingly hypnotic and ties the entire movie together.
Being I have never had the dvd disc to this movie, just the vhs copy which by the way held up extremely well, I look forward to the new diamond edition with extras.
Bambi was also one of my favorite soundtracks when Disney released it's vinyl back in the 60s, and they continue to sell on ebay, along with many other Disney original soundtracks. Now they have turntable equipment that can record vinyl to cds, plus cassette to cds also.
