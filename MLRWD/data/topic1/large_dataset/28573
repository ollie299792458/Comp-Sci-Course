Meet Joe Black was one of the most under-appreciated and under-rated films of the last decade.  While some critics complained about the film's three-hour running time, they sadly missed the point.  Director Martin Brest was not afraid to take his time in telling the quirky story of bringing death to life.  Yes, it is a remake that has been done before, (Death Takes a Holiday) and all versions have their own charm, but this one stands far and above the others.  Brad Pitt has the difficult task of trying to be mysterious, coy, threatening, menacing, charming and even funny.  He pulls all of these character traits off in ways a lesser actor might over-play or miss completely.  Newcomer, Claire Forlanie holds her own against Pitt, matching his sexual energy with grace and charm, never over-playing her sexiness.  In other words, she's hot, but doesn't play at it.  And of course, how could you go wrong with Anthony Hopkins?  His screen presence is so dominant, yet oddly subtle at the same time.  Watching his heart attack scene is a study in acting all by itself.  He is actually talking to himself, while listening to himself and writhing in pain at the same time.  Filming that scene was a nightmare unto itself, but is brilliantly done on all levels.  The supporting cast is also top notch, with Jeffrey Tambour, Jake Webber and Marsha-Gay Hardin holding up the back-story perfectly.  If you enjoy beautifully done movies that take you away to a different place and make you think about life and love, then settle in, preferably with a special friend, (No, it is NOT a chick flick!) and fall in love with movies again.  Give, Meet Joe Black, a chance.
