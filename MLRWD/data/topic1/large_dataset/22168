If you are a fan of westerns you definiatelly should not miss this. I love westerns,for some reason they just are in their completely own catheogory, creating a complete own type of world of men, guns and honour and everything. The Virginian has all the best elements that make westerns. Every episode is a classic. The scriptwriters really earned their salaries by creating fantastic stories and characters who were all played to perfection. The show is full of famous guest stars, including Harrison Ford, Charles Bronson, Lee Marvin, Robert Redford, William Shatner, Brian Keith and so many more that its impossible to remember everyone. A good tip- if your parents were young in the sixties and you want to know what shows were hot then, the Virginian is a good show to understand them. I was little over 20 years old when they started showing reruns of it in Finland and I loved to watch every episode of it with my parents because somehow it made a connection between us three when we all loved watching them together. And the dvd box itself is one of the most beautiful boxes available, really well done tinbox. Gives more honour to the great tv show that it is. I hope we get all the seasons on dvd.
