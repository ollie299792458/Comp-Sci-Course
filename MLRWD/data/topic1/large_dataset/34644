1976's "A Star Is Born" has a rich, burnished look and the romantic duo of Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson at the peak of their charismatic movie-star charms. The film--a third-time go around with a masochistic plot concerning a burnt-out male entertainer on his way out and his innocent songbird spouse just experiencing big-time fame--is pure soap, yet the handling stays fairly light and doesn't get too heavy-handed (at least until the final act). Streisand (who executive produced, and perhaps directed many sequences as well) has an extremely keen and aware sense of what her audience wants from her, and she's careful to ensure the movie is spirited with a lively pace and features some good humor. Her rapport with Kristofferson is also convincing, and the early part of their star-crossed romance is bracing, with lots of raucous show-biz business to keep things from getting too sudsy. Unfortunately the script (which Streisand concedes was added to freely and frequently) seems to lose its focus once the lovers get married, becoming mired in a necessary but glum downward spiral that isn't punctuated by much character. Barbra's Esther Hoffman goes on tour, films a TV show, argues with her husband's manager, wins a Grammy--and it's just a bushel of scenes the dialogue fails to bring together as a cohesive whole (this may be a reason why the climactic events aren't really gripping or moving the way a surefire tear-jerker would be). Much better than the film itself is Streisand's full-length commentary; Barbra gets curiously quiet during the full-blown melodrama in the movie's last half, admitting during a fight scene that "when it's heavy..you love it or hate it". She's candid and entertaining in her recollections about making the picture, the '70s clothes, and her off-screen relationship with Kristofferson, which extends to their humorous wardrobe tests and to the batch of deleted scenes.
