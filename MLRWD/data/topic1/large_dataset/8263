This is an ageless piece, a love triangle between three people in love. It represents the passion between Guenevere and Lancelot, and their respectful love for the wisdom of King Arthur. The poison of a love of passion over the love of respectful idealism. The music is as refreshing today as it was forty five years ago. I saw this move in 1967 at the age of 13. Because I loved the story of King Arthur, and the Knights of the round table. This was the first musical I had ever seem. I was smitten as youth, and have loved this movie as much today as I did forty five years ago. Richard Harris is brilliant as King Aurthur, Vanessa Redgrave never looked lovelier in any role before or sense. Franco Nero as Lancelot was a perfect selection for this role. I do not care one bit that they dubbed in his singing voice. I takes nothing away from his brilliant portrayal of Lancelot.
This is a movie to be cherished as much today as it was in 1967.
LONG LIVE THE LEGEND OF KING ARTHUR, LONG LIVE RICHARD HARRIS in his brilliant portal of this mythical King.
