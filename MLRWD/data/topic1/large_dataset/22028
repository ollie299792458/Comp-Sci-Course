This is a long movie. The details seen within it are exact. This is not a studio set in Hollywood. These are the real locations, the real appearances, the real language, the real feel and the real talent of a young dude going by the name "John Wayne". We see within this movie the evolution away from the classic theatrical acting presentation, towards a more natural style.

This movie isn't for a casual viewer because it is too long for their patience. You must have faith in the directing and writing because some characters seem like a western stereotype, chewing up the scenery and dialogue with Wayne.

Obviously John Wayne is a star. From the moment he appears, he dominates the screen with his youth and beauty. This is not the John Wayne most folks remember. This is the John Wayne that grabbed movie audiences without speaking a word. He is one totally righteously cool dude anyone under 30 will recognize and identify with immediately.

It is just a very long movie, but one any Western movie fan should have in their collection.
