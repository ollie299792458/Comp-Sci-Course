When Jack Warner heard that Reagan was running for Gov.  He said, "No, Jimmy Stewart for governor; Ronald Reagan for best friend."  Jimmy Stewart of course was a class A actor who made it to the class A movies.  This is his second time working with Frank Capra.
  I make a point to watch this movie every 4th of July.  It brings out both cynic and the romantic in me.  With strong acting, it makes it a us versus them situation.  You find yourself  rooting for Jefferson.  The final part is worth every nickel.  No, it wasn't good acting that made that hoarse voice, Jimmy went to a doctor who put some mercury in his throat!
Not a whole lot of extra features.  Its a shame that Jimmy Stewart couldn't have lived a few more years to give a audio commentary.  Nethertheless, Frank Capra Jr, gives some insights.
  Watch for "It's A Wonderful Life" character: Mr. Gower as the Maj. Leader, Uncle Billy as a reporter, and Ma Baily as Ma Jefferson!  Claude Rains play the perfect noble villian, an idealist who lost his ideas.  Did you know that this film infuriated Congress and the Press, and that companies tried to buy the rights to destroy this classic?  Find out why and watch it.
