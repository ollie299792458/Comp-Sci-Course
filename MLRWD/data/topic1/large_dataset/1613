Based on Thomas Hardy's the Mayor of Casterbrige, this film makes use of the landscape in a way that would make the author proud. While it's set in the Sierra-Nevadas at the time of the building of the railroad, and the heroines do more trudging through the snow than picking their way over the heath, the movie stays true to the essence, if not the setting of Hardy's work.
I thought the casting was excellent.  There are no "Western" stereotypes here.  The saloon girls are not ravishing, but have a certain earthy quality.  And even Nastassja Kinski looks convincingly tuburcular. Also, in an era when movies play fast and loose with history, this does an amazing job of portraying the times realistically.  For example, most of the characters are foreign immigrants or children of immigrants, and the "town" is made up of slip-shod wooden structures, not the Gunsmoke type set we're used to seeing.
However, the movie did have its flaws.  It does not, for example, tell the whole Casterbridge story. This would not be a problem, except that I got the impression that, running too long, the screenplay was cut somewhere in the middle, and then the ending was spliced on.  Also, there are some scenes that could use some follow-up but go nowhere.  And my teen-age daughter,who didn't know the story (but who suprisingly usually shares my taste in films) got bored with it.  She felt the plot was hard to follow, and the story was a little flat.
All in all, however, if you are the type of person who appreciates a well-made movie over a blockbuster, or enjoys history, I'd say it's worth seeing.
