Its a wonder how good a movie can be about a hooker/serial killer.  Honestly, I had no idea of how intense this movie would be.  Based on the true story of Florida serial killer, Aileen Wournos,'Monster', takes you into what goes on in the life of a serial killer.  Theron's portrayal is remarkable. Christina Ricci, certainly has come a long way from 'Casper', while she plays Aileen's lesbian lover.  However, as dramatic and different this role may have been for Ricci, she could've done it a little better.  The role was obviously challenging for Theron, as seen in the DVD extra featurette.  Theron put her heart in soul in this film and the Oscar was given to the right actress!  For some people,the language and sexuality of the film maybe hard to take in at first.  It definately takes and open-minded and mature person to be able to watch and appreciate this film.  Intense and memorable.  A word to the wise: do not view this in front of young people and on the DVD watch the "making of" first.
