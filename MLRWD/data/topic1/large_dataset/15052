Lets get a few issues out of the way - 1.) Yes, the new transfer has some instances of over DNR treatment.  2.) Yes, these scenes gloss over some detail.  However, it's no where near as bad as many of the newer reviews make it out to be.  I have seen this Blu-Ray twice now (willing to bet most of the whiners here giving the Blu a one have not) and it IS an improvement over the old version.  I will trade the mild over DNR of this disc for the scratchy, dirty, antiquated MPEG-2 transfer of the original Blu Ray.  Much of the grain in the old version was NOT from the film print.  It was from the horrible print they mastered from, as well as the MPEG-2 transfer.  The original Blu Ray was not much of an upgrade from watching an up-scaled DVD. The color and lighting of this new transfer are very nicely done - much better than the dull, wash-out look of the original Blu.  I also say these scenes show more detail than the original Blu Ray version due to the improved colors and lighting.  Would I have preferred a complete remaster?  Hell yes.  Do I wish the few scenes that are over-DNR'ed looked better?  Yes, as well.  Would I chose the old Blu Ray over this one?  Not a chance.  This is still the best video presentation this film has ever received.  That may not be good enough for some, but it is for me.  But, unlike many of the complainers here, I realize that all this is just my opinion.  So, don't turn into a parrot, judge the Blu for yourself and make up your own mind.  If nothing else, buy this one for the free ticket and keep it as the "bonus features" disc for the old release if you still dislike the print.  Either way, enjoy this great movie.
