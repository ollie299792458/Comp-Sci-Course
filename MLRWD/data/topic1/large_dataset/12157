Want to get fit, but don't feel like jumping around or making with a ton of equipment or feeling like other people are staring at you? Give this one a shot. It's definitely worth the money.

Set in a calm, slow environment, this one-on-one style set-up is really very cool. In the arm segment, you use 1 to 3 pound handweights, but otherwise, you use your body's own weight for resistance.

The thing about this DVD that I like is that the burn tends to sneak up on you. You do a couple of reps of something and feel fine. Another couple of reps and you're going, "Whoaaaa, Momma, I can feel the burn now."

As this is my first fitness DVD, I'd say it's good for beginners. I've had no injuries or weaknesses, and have thus far lost about 2 inches off my waist, after doing it for a month.

I do, however, suggest that you go into the lovely programming section (I LOVE this feature) and select the Body Blast to do first. It starts simply, and gets your body warmed up for the other segments.

Good luck!
