My Sister's Keeper was only made better, in my opinion, by bringing it to film.  I loved the story line in the book - a young girl is sueing her parents for the rights to make her own medical decisions.  Why you might ask?  She was born for the sole purpose of helping her sister live.  They have used her for cord blood, bone marrow, blood transfusions and more and now she wants to be able to live without worry of losing one of her organs to her sister as well.  The two young girls in the film do an excellent job portraying the sisters in the story.  One sick and one hospitalized for her sister many times.  The girls parents soon take sides as to whether or not she has the right to stop being there for her sister.  Do you side with the sick child who needs a transplant to live or the healthy one that doesn't want to be used for her body parts any more?  A tough situation for anyone to be in.

I am a nurse, so I admit medical drama is my life.  I have read several of Jodi Picoult's books for the sake of her bringing tough questions like this to the table for debate.  If you are one that likes to have a good cry during your reading or viewing of a movie, then this is a great movie to watch.
