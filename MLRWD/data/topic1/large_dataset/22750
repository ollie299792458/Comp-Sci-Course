Well, I thought I couldn't go wrong with this movie. I saw Heath Ledger's amazing performance in "The Dark Knight", and I adore Johnny Depp and jump at the chance to see any movie he's in. But this movie was a complete let-down. The cover looks amazing. It has some big names in it. It looks like an awesome movie for fantasy-lovers. A man who made a deal with the Devil for immortality at the price of giving up his daughter on her 16th birthday. Sounds promising, but that's not the case at all. The plot is sloppy. The movie hardly makes sense. It's just bad. I really don't even know what more to say about it. Perhaps it's such a poor movie because of Ledger's untimely passing. I'm guessing he didn't get to really think it through (and of course he didn't get to complete it, hence Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, and Jude Law stepping in to complete his role). I do believe these usually good actors agreed to complete the movie in honor of their friend, which is lovely. They did not care that the script is terrible. I almost feel that perhaps this is the type of story that MIGHT work in a novel, but just does not translate well at all into film.
That being said, R.I.P. Heath Ledger, and thank you Depp, Farrell, and Law for at least trying to save a sorry film.
I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this film. If you are really curious, wait until it comes on TV or something.
