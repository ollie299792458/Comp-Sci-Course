I remember seeing glimpses of this concert somewhere when I was a kid and was intrigued, as a burgeoning young listener and musician.  Since then I've discovered and come to appreciate greatly the Beatles together and separately.  Among the discoveries is an absolute love for George's album All Things Must Pass.  I daresay, it's my favorite solo Beatle project and ironically so, as I'm not so enthused about George's subsequent solo career as much as I love what I think I know of him as a person.  I find most of what was to follow to be kind of bland musically, but mostly spoiled by some really muddled production/engineering.

So, that said, I did go into the viewing of the Concert for Bangladesh with some trepidation, because I didn't want to not like it.  I was happily amazed.  All the performers seemed on top of thier game, the sound and the mix is fantastic and George's character really shines through.  From Ravi Shankar's performance right to the end I think every song is a gem...even when George fumbles some lines in Something in the Way She Moves.  Russell, Preston, Ringo and even Clapton (though he seemed a bit subdued) all shine in this concert.  It must have been incredible to be there.

If your a Beatle or George Harrison fan, (and you have a few dollars)there is no reason not to have this DVD.
