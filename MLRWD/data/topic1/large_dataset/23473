I have been watching a variety of Anime over the last year or so since I finally got around to trying it out and deciding I like much of it-- ones that I've found to be truly great are RahXephon, BoogiePop Phantom, Gungrave, Cowboy Bebop, Ranma 1/2, FLCL and Evangelion.  Others that kept me entertained but were not  as mind-bending good that I've seen are Argento Soma, Betterman, Crest of the Stars, Inuyasha, El Hazard and 12 Kindoms.  I tend to prefer episodes to movies because I don't have to spend quite as much time focused on the TV-- I'm usually on the computer or doing other things at the same time.  But I've seen the movies Laputa: Castle in the Sky and Princess Mononoke both of which were really great.

I was vaguely aware of Akira while getting into Anime, but had the impression that since it wasn't one of the newer bleeding-edge titles that while it's probably good it was not particularly on my "must see" list.  However, I finally decided to spring for it here on Amazon, and just finished watching it over the weekend.  The word that comes to mind to best describe the experience is simply "WOW."  A real roller-coaster ride unlike anything else I've seen.  It took me by surprise as to how really good it is...  It definately goes in my "best of" list, and if I'd realized it was this good I would have gone for it sooner.  I don't want to go into details and spoil the fun, and none of the descriptions I've read did it any justice anyway-- it was a real surprise (not that I expected it to be bad, I just didn't expect to be quite so impressed by it...).

Caveats:  there is a fair amount of violence, including blood & guts, etc., and some things in the "gross" category as well, though all relevant to the story.  And a little bit of nudity.  If such things offend then by all means pass it up...
