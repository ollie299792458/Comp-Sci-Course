This is my first review of any product on Amazon.

While I wont discuss the film plots and details, I would just like to voice my own opinion on these 4 films. Batman, and Batman Returns stand out as the darkest and most ambitious of the 4 films. My personal favorite of any Batman film is Batman Returns. Mostly because The Penguin is my all time favorite Batman villain
(who can argue against penguins with rockets strapped to them?), and has the best Catwoman. That 2004 atrocity doesn't exist in my book. But dont get me wrong, the first film has the best Joker to date. Yes I prefer the Nicholson Joker over Ledger Joker only because the Dark Knight Joker seemed way to dark and violent, and instead of crazy and fun. But back the the anthology films. While Batman Forever and Batman & Robin are not the worst of films in terms of quality, they completely fail in capturing the true darkness of Batman. They almost seem to poke fun at the first 2 films. But to the average moviegoer and not much of a Batman fan, they are enjoyable.
The discs themselves and the packaging are superb. Very cool case and actually having the movies and bonus material discs in their own respective cases makes it hard to damage the discs. This is the perfect set for any Batman fan, despite having 2 out of the 4 films actually worth watching, I will still give the set 5 stars. I mean come on.... its Batman. :D
