Based on the poplaur comic book of the same name,The Crow is one of the best comic book films of all time.Eric Draven(Brandon Lee in his last role)and his fiancce Shelly Webster are brutally killed by a gang of ruthless crminals the night before their wedding.Exactly one year after their death,Eric returns from the grave and is guided by a hypnotic crow to revenge on those who killed him and Shelly.The crow leads Eric to the places he needs to be and to find the people he needs to find.I never read the comicbooks at all but I still understood the premise of this dark if sometimes depressing film,the reason why I say depressing is from the fact that Brandon Lee died during the last couple of day of shooting the film with a loaded gun.The music in the film,both the songs and the score are really wonderful and they add a perfect pitch to the film,espically the song during the end credits.While the 2nd and 3rd Crow films are just ok,this one ranks high on my list of the best comicbook films ever made,like number 2 right behind Superman.Watch and enjoy this wonderful and beautiful masterpiece.
