Maybe you have to be in the right mood to enjoy this movie, and it certainly helps to have low expectations going into it. Still, there's something about it that's kind of cute and endearing. The acting sucks, the dialogue is bizarre ("I have fought 177 men; only one is still alive...and he has no legs!"), and the plot is not very important to anyone in the movie, but the set design and costume design are totally insane. The design of the movie drifts in and out of real and imagined historical periods, and every scene uncovers another bizarre, oversized piece of scenery or headgear. The chemistry between the actors is also kind of sweet, especially the young prince (Ernie Reyes, Jr, who would later play the kung-fu Yanomamo Indian leader in The Rundown with The Rock) and his man-at-arms/father figure. For some reason this movie's lack of grounding in reality suckers you in and helps you accept the strange campiness of it all. Especially cute is a prolonged sword fight scene between Arnold and Brigitte Nielson that ends with them falling down exhausted. Now if only they had cigarettes. Give this movie a shot, at least you can learn where Arnold's misogynistic butt-slapping ways came from.
