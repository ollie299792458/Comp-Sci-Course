`The greatest love story of all time' is what Baz Luhrmann's version of Romeo & Juliet has been named as. The story is set in Verona Beach, a city of money and greed. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the perfect Romeo; charming, seductive and persuasive. Juliet played by Claire Danes is sweet, innocent and curious. The pair of star crossed lovers meet by fate eye to eye and create a chemistry of desire. Shakespeare's tale of a love not meant to be is told with passion, energy and a world wide best selling soundtrack. 
The soundtrack features throughout the film to provoke different feeling emotions. Kissing You by Des'ree is the love theme song and is played in times when Romeo & Juliet are together to emphasise the love and mystery of seduction is portrayed. I believe Luhrmann chose this style of string harmony music to put you in their emotions and to be inspired to be in love. The hip up-beat music such as Pretty Piece Of Flesh by One Inch Punch creates a contrast to the slow romantic scenes which in turn relax and somewhat hypnotise you. The fast paced scenes emphasised with fast beat  music speed up the heart rate. The Capulet party is one good example where the Montague boys dress up and gate crash the party. Mercutio a dread locked drag queen with a psychotic edge played by Harold Perrineau Jr. offers Romeo a `love drug' which he accepts...
This inspiring tale of two lovers forbidden love who give their lives up in hope to be together in peace without the pressure of the impossibility to be together is tragic and sad; "For never was a story of more woe, than this of Juliet and her Romeo..."
