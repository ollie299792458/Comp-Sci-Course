I'm far from the first person to say this show was canceled way before its time.

I find myself attracted to well-written shows that don't insult my intelligence, and the gold standard for this is Joss Whedon shows such as Buffy, Angel, and the also-canceled-too-soon Firefly. Tim Minear worked closely with Joss Whedon, and was the executive producer of Wonderfalls, so it makes sense to be that this show would be must see -- and it was.

Jaye is a morose slacker in her 20s and is the odd woman out in her family of high achievers. She hides her fear of failure by not attempting to succeed and with cutting quips. Jaye, slacker ambitions aside, is just as clever as the rest of her family, perhaps more so and smart women are always needed in the TV landscape.

And then she gets konked on the head and inanimate objects in the shape of animals start talking to her. Wax Lions, Cow Creamers, Stuffed Fish, and even characters on TV all want to advise her using enigmatic and misleading phrases -- all bets are off. Brain damage? Demon possession? Insanity? G-O-D?

There is a certain courage in making a female lead less than Mary Tyler-Moore lovable, allowing her to be multidimensional, flawed, and occasionally witchy. Jaye is a less driven version of Emily Deschanel's character, Temperance, on Bones; at first glance she has too many sharp edges until you get to know her and realize the defense mechanisms at work.

A TV set that has room for Gregory House certainly can have a place for Jaye, and Temperance, and interestingly imperfect women.

Of course this show is not for everyone, but all the friends I've lent it to have loved it, and some have borrowed it more than once. If you like clever writing and an interesting woman lead, you might want to give this one a go.
