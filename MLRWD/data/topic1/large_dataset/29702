WOW!!! For a sixth sequel to come out and be revitalizing and well-made is a rare in any franchise. The story behind William Easton and his health insurance company was well paced. Hoffman continues to be on the run and brutal as ever when the FBI draws closer to him. Jill reveals what is inside the box left behind by her late husband John Kramer. Jill discovers a relalation behind a letter that was found at the crime scene of her late husband which leads to the climatic ending. Williams story drives to your emotions at times when he is forced to make a choice between who lives and who dies with his associates. But his situation is no different to those he himself puts others when denying clients of their health coverage or even getting a foot through the door. We all diserve to fight for our lives no matter what illness or ailment someone may have. John Kramer clearly found Williams theory to be wrong and a disadvantage for any person who seeks help. Saw VI is clearly tied with Saw I and III in terms of material and story. A definite recommendation to any Saw fan.
