I watched City of God twice and a half. The first time, I only saw half of it at a friend's house. It was like a drug, though, and I knew I'd have to watch the whole thing soon after.

Some films get old after the first viewing. This is not one of them. I watched it twice in a row after the time in my friend's house. It was exceptional. The story itself was exciting and gripping. Its execution is impeccable. The film draws you into the City of God so well, you almost feel ThErE. You can identify with the characters, even if you live in a land of comfort and plenty. That is one of the movie's best features - its ability to bring the world to life for the audience.

Some of the more violent scenes (for example, when a group of very young children are being interrogated, threatened and worse) are quite difficult to watch, even if you've desensitised yourself to onscreen violence, as is the norm in this age. However, I still found myself glued to the screen. I couldn't look away for a second.

I like the camera angles used in the movie. They highlight aspects of the story in different ways to further explain things nonverbally. The way the story is told is also unusual and ensures that your concentration doesn't break once through the whole thing.

In the extended versions, there are documentaries on Rio de Janeiro that are well worth watching as well.

This is a masterpiece that commands the viewers' full attention. The scope is immense, it will move you and you will not come away unscathed. I would reccommend everyone to watch it once in their lives.
