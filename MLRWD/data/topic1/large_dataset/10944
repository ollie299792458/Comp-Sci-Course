After having rented nearly all the videos at our local mom &amp; pop video rental store, and after this one came off the "new release" (more expensive) shelves, we gave it a try.  (I'll try any movie for $1.)... I'm proud to say that after renting it in excess of five times, we finally broke down and bought it.  A better purchase I could not have made!
This movie is clever, hilarious, and populated with some great characters.  Also, it's infinitely quotable, and nearly every scene rings true.  Thank goodness Mike Judge departed from Beavis &amp; Butthead to make this gem of a cinematic masterpiece.  (Okay, you might not file it next to "The Godfather," but you would definitely put it somewhere between the Marx Brothers and Wes Anderson/Owen Wilson's "Bottle Rocket")  Make that comedic masterpiece.  For my money, it doesn't get much better than when John C. McGinley gives his monologue about Michael Bolton, or when Diedrich Bader comes over as the friendly neighbor, or when Mike Judge cameos and talks about "flair," or when vengeance is taken on a certain office appliance... you get the idea.  (As I was making that list, about eight other favorite scenes popped into my head).
If you haven't seen it, give it a try.  If you have seen it and rented it more than twice (or recommended it to all your friends) then do yourself a favor and get it on DVD before it's no longer being sold.  Movies this classic don't come along very often...
