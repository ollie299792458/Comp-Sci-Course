This sequel is not as bad as the reviewers say it is.  For one thing why is anyone concerned with Eddie Baker in the first place.  Say he's out there enjoying his millons he won for surviving the night.

Here we are back in the house of madness but this time there are a few greedy hands who will get what they deserve, no spoilers here watch the movie.  I liked this movie as much as the first and for different reasons.  This movie is a little more bloody, definitely a good thing.

Okay a spoiler,
Sarah did not commit suicide she was murderd as her sister soon finds out that some thugs are looking for something hidden in the house and is worth a lot of money.  I agree with S. Kretchiks review who commented on previous reviews about Amanda Righetti (sarah's sister) wearing a semi wet-shirt.......UHM "She may have been wearing a sweater"  TRUE!
For those of you who look for that sort of thing in a movie you wont be disappointed!  Two is company, three is a crowd but not for one of the female actress in this movie.....enjoy while it lasts.

The Welcome Mat Is Out.
Do Come In.
