I had seen this movie on the opening weekend back in Septemember along with Hearts in Atlantis and thought that it was a deccent if not great hitchcock style thriller although I liked Kiss The Girls and Along Came A Spider better then this one. I was at a large music,dvd and book chain store and saw the movie on sale and bought it a few days ago. I have to say the extras are great lots of cool featurettes, cast and crew scene spefic commentries, a full legeth commentery by the gary felder and a few very breif deleted scenes amounting to little more then three total minutes. So last night after watching almost all the extras I thoght I would watch the movie again and on my tv even when its dark and there is no light the transfer is really dark and difciult to see I know it was somewhat dark in the theather. But I dont remember it being almost unwatchable. I took it out at chapter six and have put the disc up on a shelf. One day if I have nothing else to watch I might watch it. This is not a good transfer fox and if you are buying this for that reason you will be very sorry.Extras great, tranfer Horrbile, Movie deccent averge 3 stars.
