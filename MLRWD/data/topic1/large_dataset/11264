This is my first purchase of a complete series. I'm not a big fan of TV comedies.  Most of them seem crude, predictable and immature. However, "Everybody Loves Raymond" presents a refreshing, real world comedy with warmth and intelligence. There are many poignant moments as Ray tries to define himself as a husband and father and get out from under his mother's thumb.  His brother Robert gradually evolves to get his own life even as he tries to disentangle himself from Marie's apron strings and an ongoing sibling rivalry.  Aside from being entertaining,  there are lessons to be learned about forgiveness, communication, sharing and enjoying the moment. The episodes are fresh and interesting and usually contain sensitive human insights.

The set arrived in a timely manner and in good condition.  I have played the first 10 episodes so far. Except for a rare flicker in the picture on one DVD (which might have been caused by my DVD player) I am pleased with the quality.  I love the storage box - a house with faces of all the family looking at you through the windows - it makes a nice display.  The individual cases have sturdy cardboard sleeves with an additional paper liner to protect the playing surface of each disc.  It is great fun watching the series from the beginning. Each episode shows a picture and a brief synopsis of the plot which helps when you are trying to find your favorites among 210 episodes.  I have been watching 1 episode per night.  It provides my daily dose of laughter (which the Bible says is "good medicine") and the opportunity to unwind after a busy and/or stressful day.

The purchase price of $199.00 seems reasonable for what was included.
