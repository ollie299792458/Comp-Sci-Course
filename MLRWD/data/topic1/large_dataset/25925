Wanted to trade.
I have this 4 disk set with 2 disk one's.  If you have this set with 2 disk two's lets trade.
Then you can see the start of the movie and I can see the end.

Just kidding of course, waiting for amazon to actually resolve this problem.

Update:

Sent bad set back to amazon on Jan 8th.  They signed for it on Jan 12th.  It is now the 24th, my account doesn't even show that I have a return being processed.  So glad I keep all my emails, it had the tracking number and return number in it.  I then had to explain over and over again what I sent back and how I have not gotten any reply (english would be good for customer service), it seemed to just disappear.  Now I am told they are sending a refund.  Their help says I would get a refund 2 days after they get the item, it has been 12.  In the mean time I have already reordered the movie and watched all 4 disks.

Great movie, I like the added intrigue in the original silent film, that was missing from the remake.
