I read the book, which was so fantastic that I couldn't put it down and was done in 3 days so I couldn't wait until the movie came out. While the movie is different from the book, it is still pretty good. Andrea is from a small town and is a family girl who has never experienced the corporate world and especially the self-important people who go along with it.  She quickly learns to speak only when spoken to and to make her job her life if she wants to get anywhere.  She does it so profoundly that all the girls who made fun of her in the beginning are envying her in the end.  I loved the movie mostly because I can relate to Andrea because I too had the boss from hell...it was pretty scary how in certain parts her boss reminded me of mine to the T! There are tons of funny parts and in the end she makes a good decision (which I won't spoil!). Meryl Streep plays the boss very well and Anne Hathoway plays Andrea perfectly.

I absolutely LOVE her clothes in it!  If only my job had those perks ;o)
