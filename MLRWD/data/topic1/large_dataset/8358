I love this movie.  I love the flying cow and the rolling house.  ("I think we're going in!!!!!")  I love the evil meteorologists.  I love the special effects, though really Blu-Ray actually makes them a little less believable.  I love Dusty and Aunt Meg.  I love, "That's no moon - it's a space station!"  I love the exploding tanker truck.

Fine art?  Maybe not.  Plausible?  Again, not so much.  Hyperactive, over-the-top fun?  Oh yeah!  You have entered the suck zone - a land where houses roll and flying tractors are considered, "debris".  Was that another cow?  Actually, I think it's the same one.

If you're willing to suspend disbelief, I mean, seriously suspend it, you'll love this movie.  It's got its own sort of logic, though seriously, if a downdraft and microburst can tear up a drive-in movie theater, how come an F5 tornado doesn't break the leather strap at the end?  OK, maybe it doesn't follow its own logic much, but it's fun!

Oh, and if you ever get the chance to do the Twister "ride" at Universal Studios Florida, it's well worth it.  There, you got a bonus review, too.
