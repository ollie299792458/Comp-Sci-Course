Kenneth Branagh has redefined "Hamlet", with what I feel is the definitive version. His determination to bring the full text to the screen, rather than a "highlights" version, should be applauded with the  same passion as the finished product! His use of the score as an integral  part of the film, or another character if you will, is also wonderful and  refreshing. Patrick Doyle is in my opinion the best currently available,  and I cannot imagine a Branagh film without a Doyle score.
I found his  interpretation of Hamlet exactly as I have always felt it; that Hamlet's  public displays were mere mockeries. His true feelings were revealed  virtually only when he was alone. I have never seen a clearer indication  that Hamlet's struggle was against himself, rather than Claudius or  Polonius. The physical staging of the soliliquy brought chills; Hamlet is  facing himself, addressing himself, yet yards away from his reflection. He  gradually draws closer to himself as he struggles with himself; finally  form and reflection meet at knifepoint.
One must see this film more than  once to get all that is possible out of it. I have read the play since  seeing the film, and then watch all or part again, always finding something  fresh about it.
For me, Kenneth Branagh IS "Hamlet". A great  triumph!
