I would say the first scene alone is better than the entire film "el topo" (which was by no means a bad film). I watched the two back to back. Theres nothing I can say about this film that hasn't been said before. The only thing that might turn you off is that you can tell at times that this was made in the 70's, and certain moments seem campy, if thats the right word, like something from a john waters film, but there are only a few moments, such as the woman with green hair (and pubes). I had this same feeling when watching 2001: A Space Odyssey, the beginning of which is the greatest film I have ever seen (beautiful and timeless), but once you see the space station and I guess the way that they viewed the future back then, its way too 70's and retro (like wood paneling on the instruments, which looked like Moog synthesizers) I couldn't even finish the film. But just when I start to feel the movie is losing its momentum, something comes along to make me realize that the director knew what he was doing (ie. the green haired woman sitting on a very tall toilet). This movie had me laughing out loud at many points, not because I found it particulary funny, but just because of how bizarre and surreal certain moments were. It was laughter out of joy.

I will admit that I just bought this yesterday and have yet to finish it (I was watching it late at night and kept nodding off and having to rewind it), but I have seen enough to write this.
