This movie, if it was based on a fictional basis it would be very good. The problem is not the artistic work itself, it is the false portrayal of typical Japanese soldiers of WWII. This movie was shot through western eyes and using western values. Making the Japanese soldiers then appear to be noble people. Well nothing could be further from the truth. In the rape of Nanking in 1936, the Japanese soldiers were savage and brutal. Rape and murder of thousands of Chinese. Japanese soldiers for sport, threw babies in the air and impaled them with their bayonets. In Guam, an American territory was occupied by the Japanese. They beheaded a Catholic priest and many others because the loyal Guamaninans refused to tell the Japanese where a US navy sailor was hiding. The Battann death march, where POW soldiers died. Those who fell and were too weak were bayonetted on the spot and died where they lay. Need I go on? You get the idea. I am afraid Clint Easwood fell in with the hollywood PC crowd a few years ago and served up this historical lie. He knows the truth. He grew up during WWII. Pathetic.
