Thought I was getting the usual, unreflective guy comedy. Instead, I got a surprisingly smart, sweet movie with a healthy sense of irony. Pleasant surprise.

Paul Rudd has elevated snark (and snark-repentant) into an art form, and if you like that, this is a fun movie to watch. Plus, he ends up in KISS makeup and Ren-fair attire at the end--so surreal, you've just *got* to see it.

Sure, there are moments of stupid guy comedy, but gals, Seann William Scott gets nekked and Paul Rudd is easy on the eyes.  This almost makes up for the momentary but gratuitous silicone shots. Also, the ladies the hold their own. Elizabeth Banks gets in some good, funny lines in and Judy Lynch has a brilliant knack for playing off-kilter characters.

And yeah, the kids do all right. Let's put it this way: I hate kids, and this movie was still funny, so the two underage actors must have been doing something right.

All in all, I found this movie well worth watching. Look, if you don't like guy comedy (and you know who you are) don't watch it. But if you can get over the occasional fart/boob/etc. jokes,  there's a lot to enjoy, and the movie is smarter and sweeter than you might expect.
