This was undoubtebly the scariest movie I have ever seen.  Probably because this is the first and only horror movie I've ever seen, but still.  I'm surprised I haven't had any nightmares about it yet.  
I'm well aware that the plot was flawed quite a bit -- the only thing crucial to the existance of the video tape was the mom chucking her kid into the well, but they added a bunch of superfluous stuff about the horses, the suicidal husband, and what was with those flies?!?! Anyway, most of it was probably done just for the shock, and, well, it worked.
This movie got a PG-13 but I think it should have gotten an R, since me and my three friends I saw this with are all fourteen and fifteen and we were all freaked out of our wits.  No PG-13 movie has ever scared me like that before, which is why I only gave it three stars; it was so scary it got ruined for me.  Of course, if you're an adult and/or a veteran horror movie viewer you probably won't be too impressed.  But if you're anything like me . . . be prepared to sleep with your door open for a week.
