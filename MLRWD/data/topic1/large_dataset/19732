I don't really understand that this film didn't have any success but I belive it's a really wonderfull one.

Great actors like Samuel L Jackson, Pam Grier and Robert de Niro, shouldn't have risked their prestige for a piece of trash.

Please don't expect a romantic film or a superproduction, but an exciting film of the life of one human being that found herself involved in a big trouble, dressed with such wonderfull actors and directed in such a creative way by Quentin Tarantino.

If you don't like to know that some characters will be shooted ... then this isn't your film. If you like blody scenes, this isn't either your film ... if you cannot resist to have sexual scenes .. this have 1 ... if you like creative characters Jackie Brown is a smart character and I adore the way she solve her problems.

May be I will find some other 500 or 1000 films in my life that I can consider more artistic than this one, may be there are millons that have spended more economic and technology resourses, but I will hardly find 10 films that I enjoy watching more than this.
