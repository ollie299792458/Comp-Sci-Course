I have to concur with many of the other reviewers: this is a good movie as a stand-alone experience, but only if you have not read Stephen King's collection of short novels from which this story is taken.  In fact, the naming of this film is somewhat confusing, because the story told in the film is not "Hearts In Atlantis."  It is actually a King novella called "Low Men In Yellow Coats."  "Hearts In Atlantis" is another novella from the same collection and the compilation took it's name from that story.  I guess the studio thought that "Hearts In Atlantis" had a better Hollywood "ring" to it than the story's original title; or maybe since they eliminated the "yellow coats" of the low men, they realized that the original title would not work.

I'm not sure why Stephen King agreed to this name swap.  The title "Hearts In Atlantis" actually makes sense in the context of the original story of that name.  The story features both "hearts" (the card game) and "Atlantis" (the narrator's metaphor for the forgotten 60's college experience).  But in the context of the "Low Men" story about Ted and Bobbie, it has no relevance.  It would be like taking the story of Gone With The Wind and renaming it Citizen Kane -- it makes no sense.

Oh well, it is what it is.  A good film, but a much better collection of short stories.  Read the book.  Each story stands alone, but they also feature common characters, and together all of the stories work together to bring you full circle.  And as another reviewer pointed out, if you read Heart's In Atlantis (or more specifically "Low Men In Yellow Coats"), you will be tantilized by questions that are answered in King's magnum opus Dark Tower series...it will suck you in and provide a few more months of reading the best work by America's laureate, Stephen King.  Enjoy!
