First of all I should clarify, this is not my favorite movie because I think it is the best movie ever made. This is my favorite movie because it has a great script with fantastic story progression, amazing acting, and wonderful camera work!

I love this movie because it does not clog up the sound waves with unnecessary dialogue and noise, rather it uses the silence and few words that are spoken to set the tone. When this movie starts, all you know is that one man (Brosnan) is being chased by another man (Neeson) and his hired posse. You don't know why Brosnan is being chased, but this chase is the entire stage of the movie.

This chase starts in the snowy mountains and eventually makes its way to different areas. This is another area where I found this movie is particularly strong. It paints a very complex world that is easy to be interested in, while not getting very involved in it. The camera shots are often wide and far out to capture the mountains and valleys, and if I am not mistaken the directing cameraman had won several awards prior to this movie (it is obvious why!). There were several moments that made this movie my favorite (spoilers!), and overall this movie is the best western I have seen in a long, long time!

I don't think you can really go wrong with this movie! I only recommend avoiding it if you do not enjoy story based movies (in favor of shoot em' ups westerns etc).
