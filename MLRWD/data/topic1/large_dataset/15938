Im an avid reader of Daredevil and enjoyed the film. The writers got a great deal straight from the comics. They also changed the character and his mythos, but that's par for the course. It has changed in various ways in the comics. DD went from a happy "devil may care" character (check out the 1964 origin issue and read from there) to a darker brooding character filled with rage and self pity. DD didn't just develop into a darker person, but his new traits were "retro-fitted" into his history. In other words, Daredevil has various "true" pasts and incarnations. 
The character of Stick was a later addition to the DD mythos. Look at the first issue of DD. There was no Stick. DD developed his skills on his own. Stick isn't in the movie, but then it took something like 15 years for Stick to show up in the comics. Elektra was another later addition to the comic. DD's intense rage and insanity weren't there at the start either. Matt's brother has been long forgotten. There are other things that aren't there in the original comics, and ideas from the older comics that aren't in later ones. Many of the retro-fitted ideas into DD's history don't match the original character, but they've kept DD alive. 
The changes in the film serve the same purpose as those which have taken place in the comics. DD in the film is much darker at the start. He's more Punisher than Daredevil, but what makes him ultimately not like the Punisher is demonstrated as the film plays out. I think it's a good explanation for why DD is who he is. Given a character that has changed a great deal since 1964, the makers of this movie did very well. There isn't just one way to tell his story or one story to tell. I'm happy with the results and can't wait for more.
