This is one of those awesome movies I like to show people who like campy B flicks, just to see their reaction when things get nasty. It can be summarized as a very silly film punctuated with scenes of total mayhem, ranging from schizophrenic freakouts to bloody supernatural violence. It all melts together and there really isn't a good sense of where the silliness and the madness separate, which is exactly why I love this film so much. I find myself returning to it over and over, rolling my eyes at campy dialogue and cheesy music and completely mesmerized by the outbursts of surreal gore and spectral visitations. In some scenes you get all of this at once, and it can be tricky to roll my eyes and be mesmerized at the same time, but it never stops me from trying.

In all I'd say House is one of the few Japanese horror films that is so weird I actually consider it art. It easily gets five stars and, to be frank, I totally get the low ratings from other reviewers. You'll either like this or you don't, and neither me nor anyone I've shown it to is anywhere in between.
