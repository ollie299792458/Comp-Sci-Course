Beloved is an excellent movie.

Beloved was adapted from Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name.

Jonathan Demme's strong direction, Tak Fujimoto's stunning photography (especially the yellow tinted flashbacks), the sets, the costumes, the acting, all come together to create a towering achievement in filmmaking.

Oprah is very impressive in the role of Sethe a former slave who is haunted by her violent past. So many scenes are noteworthy. The 28 days of freedom scene, the They took my milk scene, her final scene, and others. Oprah deserves much of the credit for this great movie, as she is the one who fought for ten years to get it made.

Kimberly Elise gives a greatly sympathetic performance as Denver, Sethe's daughter. There is an undercurrent of strength in her character that comes out when she is in the forefront of the movie. Her character is comparable to Celie in The Color Purple, in terms of the ultimate strength of her character.

Thandie Newton is riveting in the title role of Beloved. She gives an intense performance that turned many people off. It is really rare to see an actor give a performance as bold as hers.

Danny Glover gives a fine performance as Paul D. also a former slave who has spent his post slave years wondering around the U.S.

Special attention has to be paid to Beah Richards as Baby Suggs. She gives the type of performance that should be taught in acting classes. The passion and commitment are astounding. The scenes where she is preaching in the clearing are breathtaking and inspirational. She more than deserved a second Oscar nomination. The first being for Guess Who's coming to Dinner.

Rachel Portman's score perfectly compliments the movie. It also stands out by itself as a work of art. She won an Oscar for Emma (1996) and has been nominated several times since, but oddly not for Beloved, which may be her best work.
