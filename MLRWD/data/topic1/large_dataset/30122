1. Amazon : shipment (to France) received in (short) time.

2. The set : A Criterion reference. Beautiful set of 5 disks. Not seen yet the extended 5 h version. The Theatrical version is the one seen 28 years ago, at release on screen. The one I saw in 1983. some lack of definition, but very pure colors. Swedish language and english subtitles, understanding with few english vocabular (no french subtitles at the time).

2. The movie : A master piece, both the top and a summary of Bergman's work. The world seen by the eyes of a child, shot by a wise old man : life, love, death, happyness and poor condition, hunger and fear, greed and pain. Men like children. Women overflowing with desire. A magic world with ghosts and crying women. A theater of passions. Not filmed theater, but movie made theater. A window, a static shot, fa√ßade of houses like front stages, puppets, models. The small world of theater opponed to a great world, the outside, but overwhelming it in a sense. Fresh flesh and rotten bodies. And time. narrowed ans dilated time. Dead man still alive, characters looking still with years. Tragedy with happy ending, dreams and reality. Colors. Red. Smell of dust, smell of death, smell of love. Childhood and old age. Life. Theater of life and life contained in theater. All that in a movie. Thank you Ingmar Bergman.
