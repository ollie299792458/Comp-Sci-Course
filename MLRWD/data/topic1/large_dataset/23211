The movie is disturbing. I guess thats what it's meant to be because it is in no way shape or form scary. The special effects aren't that great cause it was made in 71, but I Imagine they were decent for the time. I think the abbrupt ending and bad films cuts add to the messed up feel of this movie and make it better, cause the movie is so strange to begin with. I didn't find the killing or rape shocking, just the idea that the 4 criminals did it for the hell of it is kinda sick. and another thing that makes the movie kinda good, is that the parents don't act bloodthirsty or crazy, and all the victims are dead within a 10 or fifteen minute time span, and the parents are so ametuer about trying to kill the people, they barely are able to kill them because they are scared themselves or just not smart. but anyhow, if you bought this to see phenomonal acting and awesome special effect, you bought it for the wrong reason. It is a classic because this was the first movie to do this type of stuff, but I will say this, it's a heck of a lot better than most prissly teen slasher flicks you see today, and I liked this movie better than scream.
