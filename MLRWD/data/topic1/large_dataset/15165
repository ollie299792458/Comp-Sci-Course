I remember reading and having read to me Beverly Cleary's "Ramona" series.  They are a great series of books, full of all sorts of adventures, of the kinds kids really have. Ramona experiences life in a way we can all remember experiencing it when we were kids.
I've seen other book adaptations made by Walden Media. They really do a good job.  "Ramona and Beezus" is no exception.
If you've read the books, (which I hope you have!) you will, as you watch this movie, see plot twists coming that were in the books. You'll be watching a part of it, and think "I wonder if this is going towards  __ (fill in the blank)", and you won't generally get disappointed!
That said, however, I felt they may have tried to cram too many events from too many of the books into one film. Don't get me wrong. I loved seeing the wonderful plot twists played out on screen, but I just felt like perhaps there were too many crammed into too short a time.
Joey King and Selena Gomez star in this movie as Ramona and her big sis, Beezus. It's a fun film that I think will surprise and please even the biggest fans of Cleary's book series.
