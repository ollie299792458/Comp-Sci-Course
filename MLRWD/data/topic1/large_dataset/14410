Reese Witherspoon is lovely as Elizabeth Masterson, a hardworking (but over-worked) doctor at St. Matthew's Hospital in San Francisco.  She has no time for a life outside of her job considering she works grueling 26-hour shifts in hopes of gaining the spot of attending physician at the hospital.  And she does land this position.  But on her way to her sister's for dinner and a blind date after finding out the good news, Elizabeth is in a terrible car accident...  Enter Mark Ruffalo, who is charming and sweet as David Abbott, a lonely, depressed man still trying to cope with the loss of his wife, and who finds solace in drinking his troubles away.  A simple twist of fate finds a flyer for the sublet of Elizabeth's apartment plastered to his face (literally).  David moves into the apartment, and he begins seeing Elizabeth's spirit around a little too often.  She insists it's her apartment and is trying to get him to leave.  He insists that it's his apartment and tries to tell Elizabeth she is no longer alive, but she swears otherwise.  She says she hasn't seen "the light" and keeps insisting that she is not dead, but she just doesn't know exactly what the problem is, and why her spirit has left her body.  So then what is it?  Is she alive?  Is she not alive?  And why is David the only person that can see her and talk to her?  This is a delightful story about fate, love and learning that our jobs aren't everything, and that there is much more to life than work.  Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo are wonderful together.  This movie is a ten!  Definitely one of my favorites.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a romance with a few good twists added in.  You'll enjoy this one!
