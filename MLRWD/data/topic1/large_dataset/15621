Season 2 became the pivotal point for Angel investigations.  As Angel has learned that he will become human, Gunn is now a part of investigations, and the Host becomes a friend.  Even though Wesley is a recurrent cast member, this season sets the tone for him to become a "hero".
The second episode "Are You Now Or Have You Ever Been", I have watched probably over 50 times, is the best episode since Becoming Part 2.  In fact it is the best episode of the entire BTVS and Angel series combined.  It sets everything in to place for Angel investigations at the Hyperion.  (It is sad thought that they are stating the Hotel will no longer be apart of Angel as the end of Season 4 is coming).  Back to Season 2...Lindsey and friends are the constant bad that will always be there to cause Angel and friends trouble.  The show from Season 1 had constant bad guys, but now it is known what W&H wants (Angel on their side in the coming Apocalypse). As we go into the season, we see that Angel is having to deal with his Sire Darla.  Inner troubles cause Angel to get rid of his gang and hunt her down and kill her.  However, as the season winds down, it ends perfectly.  We go to Pylea where the Host is from to find a new soon to be Angel member next season, Fred.  The last 3 episodes are just brilliant.  It is no wonder that the show can hold its own.  Overall, Season 2 has been my favorite season of all 4 seasons of Angel combined and all 7 seasons of Buffy combined.  One word...Angel. This character has inner struggles that allows him to be ever changing.  He isn't constant and season 2 explores this very well.  Season 2 is a must buy...period.
