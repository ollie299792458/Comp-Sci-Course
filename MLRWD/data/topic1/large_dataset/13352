I haven't enjoyed a movie more in a long time than watching "Thoroughly Modern Millie." Julie Andrews was just wonderful in this film as well as Mary Tyler Moore with the added bonus of Carol Channing playing Muzzy. I was browsing on amazon for any Julie Andrews movies and this gem came up. I had never seen or heard of this film, and after watching it was not dissapointed!

Set in the "Roaring 20's", Millie (Julie Andrews) whom is looking for a husband Trevor Graydon (played by John Gavin) goes and lives in New York city at an all girls boarding house run by Mrs. Meers (Beatrice Lillie) a front-lady for an oriental white slavery ring. Miss Dorothy (Mary Tyler Moore) leaves home to find "her way in the world" also comes to New York city and meets Millie at the same boarding house.  The two girls together create quite a pair in their zany, wacky ways in this madcap of a movie. The antics that happen will leave you falling off the couch with laughter!

This is a movie that the entire family would enjoy. It is funny, heart-warming, suspenseful, and thrilling. I would encourage anybody who wants clean, quality entertainment in their home to purchase a copy for their DVD library. It's a classic!
