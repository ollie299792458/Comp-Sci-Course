I can say with all honesty that this is the first and only horror film to make me lose an entire night's sleep! I considered myself a jaded horror film veteran impervious to theatrical scares until I watched "The  Haunting." This film is one of the few cases where the film version  surpasses the book it is based upon. The psychological implications of this  film are devastating, and are some of the film's great strengths. The  acting is superb all-around, especially the inimitable Julie Harris, in her  best role as the doomed Eleanor. One former complaint comes to mind with  the "miscasting" of Russ Tamblyn as the playboy, Luke: At first I  thought his hammy performance to be the film's only liability; now I've  come to realize - after repeated viewings - that Tamblyn played Luke  perfectly, as a narcissist without an ounce of introspection who  reluctantly accepts the presence of the supernatural in his future home.  Tamblyn's character is the only one with the good sense to suggest they all  get the hell out of there when the supernatural events turn ugly. Each of  the film's characters is well-played by an outstanding cast of old pros who  treat the material seriously. There are too many deliciously creepy scenes  to fully list, but the door-breathing scene and Eleanor's hand-holding  scene are two of the most frightening sequences ever filmed. Do NOT watch  this movie alone!
