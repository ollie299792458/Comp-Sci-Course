I saw and bought it without hesitation. I love sci-fi from the 50's, so this was an unexpected delight. First, the images are great. I have never seen the original format of The Fly -- always on 4:3 TV. The sound is better than expected (4 channel!). The sequel is better than I remembered it. Very entertaining. The last movie I have to say surprised me: I've never seen it, which was a good reason to buy the set. A very good sci-fi thriller. Many lab scenes, which are of course required for sci-fi movies. Really creepy. Some reviewer mentioned that the chronology didn't make sense: the father in the third movie was a middle aged man yet the grandson of Hedison in the first. It's explained, sort of: the police inspector quickly mentions that when Phillippe (in Return) had his genes mixed with the fly, it gave him rapidly accelerated aging. It's still a good, fun movie.

I wish they made more movies like this now days. I've seen the remake, and it makes me sick. Too violent, gory, too much sex. If I am watching the original movies and a child entered the room, I wouldn't be bothered at all. But if a child walked in as I was watching the man-fly-machine mess blow its head off at the end of the remake, I would stop the player and turn off the tv. 50's movies were more innocent, and 20th Century (as well as other studios) still have some fun ones lurking in vaults just waiting for DVD release. I hope they hurry...I'm getting old.
