I enjoyed this film. It's the story of someone who's pushed so far that he will take the law in to his own hands. Sadly since Artisan Entertainment (now part of Lions Gate) didn't provide a decent amount of funding I think the film suffers, but not at the expense of the acting or most of the action. The film did indeed loose some of the story that would have made it far better, but I think that it still stands strong considering a mere 33 million dollar budget and lack of support from the studio. I think that this is a gritty, and intense film that is a nice throwback to action films of the late sixties and seventies.

What I liked:
The acting seemed almost perfect. Tomas Jane did a fantastic job playing a man who's suffered the loss of everything and is still standing.
Most of the action sequences are well done, and believable.
The story is great.

What I didn't Like:
John Travolta's acting wasn't quite there. Believable, but not menacing.
Some of the story suffered at the expense of a limited budget.

This isn't a kids film, and I wouldn't recommend it for younger children. For older teens and adults it's fine. If you're a fan of gritty action films with loads of gunfire, I think you'll enjoy this film.
