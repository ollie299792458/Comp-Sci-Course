Sorry to sound juvenile, but this is the freakin' funniest thing I have ever seen.  It is sly, intelligent and very English, which is a perfect combination in my opinion.

Ricky Gervais is a great comedian and equally skilled actor (even if he begs to differ).  When I first saw this on cable, I would giggle to myself for days recalling certain scenes.  Now that I own it (one of the smartest purchases I've ever made), I have not stopped laughing out loud, not one day.  I keep remembering hilarious lines delivered with perfectly serious faces, and I burst out laughing!

If you enjoy British humor, if you've seen only a few episodes of "The Office," do yourself a favor and buy this gem.  Ricky Gervais is the best thing to come along in quite awhile. Whoever thought such non-stop fun and happiness could be found for such a low price?

Oh, and the DVD extras are even more hysterical if you can possibly believe it.  The interview with Ricky and Stephen Merchant alone is a gem.  But the music video, oh my God...The music video.  There simply are no words.  Enjoy!
