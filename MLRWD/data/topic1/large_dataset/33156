There's nothing like a long, dark winter in western Montana to help you fall in love with the warmth, color, music and love stories of Bollywood films, and "Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi" is one of my favorites.  It's a more recent film, and the quality of directing, acting, and choreography is terrific.  I especially enjoyed seeing Shahrukh Khan play a different sort of role in this movie in the character of Suri.  Quiet, shy, thoughtful, and respectful, Suri is also alluring, and the new actress, Anushka Sharma as "Tanni", plays very well alongside him, making their situation completely believable.

I love the storyline of this movie.  Of course the music and dance are wonderful, and part of the genre, but there is also something special and different about this film.  I've read other reviews of this movie, and few have mentioned the spirituality of the story.  Perhaps it's because I come from a culture that doesn't publically display faith, but I was touched by how faith played a role in every big decision, and especially in matters of true love.

I highly recommend this movie.  If you don't like long movies, then you probably aren't a fan of Bollywood anyhow.  For me, the time just flys, because I'm in a completely different world.  I know you can't judge a country by its films, but I now have a deep desire to learn more about India, and to someday visit that big, varied and complex land.
