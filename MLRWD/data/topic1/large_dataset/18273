I think a lot of the people reviewing the film don't have a family member who is on the autism spectrum, and for them instead of that part of the storyline adding to the film, it detracts from it a bit.  I'm not being critical of the negative reviewers because in a way it is a problem with the film.  They made a high quality martial arts film while at the same time trying hard to send a positive message (in my opinion) about people on the spectrum, and for many the two don't mix.  I would think it might make a good date movie with both people coming away happy having seen a different film. :)  My son is on the spectrum, and we felt they did a great job in how they portrayed the autistic girl, and also the fight scenes were awesome.  I would think that anyone who is a fan of martial arts films (especially the classics) would love this one.  The girl is actually a skilled martial artist in real life, and if they used any CGI, I didn't notice it.  My only complaint is that there was a little more blood than necessary.  I don't mind blood, but a couple of the most gory scenes didn't seem to add anything.
