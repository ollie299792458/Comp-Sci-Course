One can be saddened or deeply shocked over the recent death of the star of Ben-Hur, Charlton Heston on April 5, 2008.  Nevertheless, one thing that will never be forgotten is the magnitude of many of Mr. Heston's movies, such as Ben-Hur.

This particular movie is actually an epic of a greatest magnitude, whether one thinks of the chariot race or one of the other many scene's that will forever be imbedded in one's mind.  This particular movie is sure to please audiences for generations to come.

My particular favorite of scenes was Mr. Heston as Judah Ben-Hur, as a slave who had to cross a desert into Nazareth and with the rest of the slaves dying of thirst.  The Romans felt they and their horses should drink first, before any of the slaves.  As for Judah, he was to receive no water at all.  In his suffering, he lies down upon the ground asking God to help him and Jesus comes with water just for him and brushes the head of Judah, to give him comfort.

When a Roman soldier comes towards Jesus to hit him with a whip, Jesus get's up and looks at the soldier and he could not hit him after looking into his face.  As for Judah, before he was forced to march again with the rest of the slaves, he had gotten his fill of water.

Scenes like that, is what makes a good movie for all audiences.
