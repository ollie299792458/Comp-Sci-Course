Ben Affleck can act.

Whether he can direct or not remains to be seen.

The Town shows some good signs and some glaring holes.

What he does well are the action scenes.  He also selected a really good premise, gritty, tough Irish neighborhood where band robbery is a cottage industry.  In any movie this is half the battle.

Where he sucks is in character development and capturing the ambience of this Boston neighborhood.

The female lead, that tall rangy actress whose name I always fail to remember is two dimensional and we have no idea why she would walk out and her job as a bank manager and start hanging out in what looks like a community garden with a bunch of munchkins.  What in the hell is she doing there anyway?  Ben's character is a little too noble as are his friends, who at the end of the day are bank robbers who kill people without a second thought.  There is also some slutty blond that hangs around inferring the child she has in tow is Ben's.  What in the hell is that about?  Don't any of these characters have a back story that is worth more than two sentences?

The neighborhood comes off as too pretty and as a great place to live when he should strive to show the random violence, hopelessness and grinding poverty of the place.

However, like I said, the action scenes are first rate but unfortunately are not enough to sustain the movie.

Better luck next time Ben.
