Baz Luhrmann at his finest.  This terrific film is really three movies in one.  First, there's the tremendous dance movie whcih centers on Scott Hastings (Paul Mecurio) and his struggles to introduce 'new steps' to the  sheltered world of Austrailian ballroom dancing.  For dance afficiandos,  despite the broad comedy that infuses the movie, the dancing is the real  thing.  Mecurio is a formally trained dancer and you simply can't fake,  edit, or body-double the moves he pulls off in this film.  Even if you're  not a dancer, Mecurio's athletiscism alone is worth seeing.
The second  movie is a Dirty Dancing-style, boy-meets-ugly-duckling tale. The story  allows you to peek behind the covers of a first generation Australian and  her awkward attempts to fit into a  new culture while maintaining her  European ties at home.
The third movie is what sets Strictly Ballroom  apart from the field - tremendously funny, broad caricatures squabbling  around the periphery of Scott and his struggle to bring his 'new steps' to  the Pan-Pacific Championships.  Pat Thompson is hysterical as Doug's mother  Shirley, and Bill Hunter is wonderfully over-the-top as dancing kingmaker  Barry Fife ('There are no new steps!').  But attention first-time viewers -  keep your eyes on Barry Otto as Scott's father, Doug Hastings.  This odd,  seemingly shell of a man is actually the  emotional core of the film.  He  provides the movies funniest moments (particularly - as other reviewers  have alluded to - a flashback sequence so over-the-top hilarious that it  defies description) and its most relevatory ones.
Play this film over and  over again and you will never be disappointed.
