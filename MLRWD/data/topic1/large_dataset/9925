Quentin Tarantino has shown time and time again what's missing in our "special effect" happy movies of now. What makes his movies special surely isn't the effects... Tarantino gets it done like the classics of old.
  One: Dialogue. Interaction of characters by using everyday small talk, believable attitudes, and great sequences of emotions experienced by the characters.
  Two: Plots and Settings. Coffee shops, pawn shops, warehouses, and apartments. Everyday places.
  Three (to me, the secret weapon): Soundtrack. Most of these songs are either past hits, or old songs made into hits by Tarantino's movies. Most of his songs chosen before the script is started.
  And last, but certainly not least Four: Choice of actors. Who would ever have imagined Eric Stoltz as a heroine dealer or John "Disco" Travolta as a "heroine user/hitman?"
  Tarantino combined Samuel L. Jackson, who at the time was little known, and another actor John Travolta, who I will forever see as "Vinny Barbarino", and created some of the best in-movie conversations ever. I want to order a "Royale with cheese" at McDonalds every time I go. I like giving foot messages now, but ONLY to women. And I now know why...Both actors' careers skyrocketed after the movie's release. Bruce Willis shows an outstanding performance as a has-been boxer who steals an opportunity set in his path. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer also chip-in with some great scenes as armed robbers. Every scene is some crazy scenario with a handful of on-point actors, who pull you in with the greatest of ease.
  I could go on and on about this movie and others (Resevior Dogs, Four Rooms, Jackie Brown, and Natural Born Killers, for example, but a purchase of Pulp Fiction is sure to start any "REAL" movie lover off to a long relationship with Quentin Tarantino and his "Masterful Creations."
