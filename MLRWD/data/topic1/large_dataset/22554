Originally shot and completed in 1956,but wasn't released until 1959,legendary schlock master Ed Wood had originally made a low-budget sci-fi exploitation flick which later became fondly known by pure cinema snobs as one of the worst films of all time.Worst film my a--,"Plan 9 From Outer Space" is 'the' Wood cult classic and it's most certainly not one of the worst films ever made.In fact,it's also one of the most entertaining and fun films of the late '50's !  Following his highly controversial flicks "Glen Or Glenda ?" and "Bride Of The Monster" (both seriously regarded in my opinion as the two worst films of his career),Ed Wood wanted to make a cheesy low-budget sci-fi film that meant to be an exploitation ploy on America's fascination with the then popular UFO phenomenon and also in the midst of the Cold War.Most notable for the final film appearance of the legendary Bela Lugosi who sadly,before filming was supposed to begin,died of a heart attack.The actual footage of him in "Plan 9" was actually taken from test 'home movie' footage for a film that was thankfully never made called "The Ghoul On The Moon".Most of the later footage that involved Lugosi's character is actually played by none other than Ed Wood's real life chiropractor,Thomas Mason,who only is shown with a cape hiding over his face and is noticably a bit taller than Lugosi.Despite the claustrophobic appearances of the two men within the same scene,the film also has good,but not Hollywood good performances from Gregory Walcott as the story's main hero,Tom Keene,Paul Marco as Officer Kelton,Lyle Talbot,and of course the films' other famous stars Tor Johnson and Vampira.Sure it isn't meant to be a normal,average,everyday sci-fi B-movie,but when people look back on the film,Ed Wood knew that he was no Orson Welles nor Frank Capra and he probably thought he didn't intend "Plan 9" to be a serious sci-fi feature either.There's plenty of action,comedy,cheesy special effects,good photography,and of course the tedious,but plausible direction by Wood.I've seen many far worse very bad movies in terms of acting and production values,but "Plan 9" will certainly not dissappoint even the most casual of non-B-movie fan alike and this brand-new DVD release from the great folks at Legend Films certainly do justice to this legendary cult classic !

There have been only two other DVD releases of "Plan 9" prior to the Legend release,first by Image and then by budget distributor Passport Video.The big differences between the two versions were not only the visual presentation of the film themselves,but also two different documentaries about Wood and his films.The Image release featured a two-hour complete documentary on the making of the film called "Flying Saucers Over Hollywood:The Plan 9 Companion" while Passport featured a much shorter 45 minute bio called "The Ed Wood Story".The brand-new Legend Films release is by far the definitive restoration work on the film to date and  it defintely shows too!  The disc features both a nicely restored original black & white version as well as showcasing for the first time,a brand-new digital colorized version of the film !  Considering a lot of the excellent colorization that Legend does with all of their films on DVD,the results for both are faboulous,but wait !  This version also has a collection of rare Ed Wood material that you probably won't find anywhere else on DVD with over three minutes of extremely rare TV commercials shot by the man himself (of lackluster quality) as well two-minute home movie footage of Ed celebrating his birthday and of course the famous footage of the director in drag and practically puts on a show for the camera ! The music track included in the home movie features are annoying and best left mute.  Fake 'deleted' scenes and colorized trailers for other great Legend releases also appear and to round off the disc,Mike "MST3K" Nelson is back as always for an another exciting,witty,and fun commentary track for both versions of the film as well !  Also too on either version of the film,a well-done trivia subtitle track also appears giving rare info on the making of the film,its stars and director.Makes a great companion and double feature piece to Tim Burton's well-done 1994 film "Ed Wood" with Johnny Deep in the title role as well !

Great special edition of a legendary 'turkey';highly recommended to classic film fans and buffs alike !  You are not going to be dissappointed with this definitive release ! Enjoy !
