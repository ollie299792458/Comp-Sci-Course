It's funny how the one person on this page who likes this movie the least, Yog, goes on to write the logest and most detailed "review".  He apparently felt the need to give us a rambling and grammatically deficient account(run-on sentences anyone?) of each character and their role as he sees them.  However, the fact that Yog had such an emotional response to certain aspects of the film (i.e.: Ricci's lack of fidelity to Biggs and Allen's Jewish paranoia) seems to negate his claims of disinterest and his label of the movie as an "abortion".  If, to Yog, "the most interesting character in the movie is the rifle" then we learn more about him and his failings as an audience member than we do about the movie itself.
"Anything Else" is Allen's best work since "Deconstructing Harry".  Although not as good as "Deconstructing Harry", "Anything Else" does, hopefully, mark a return to form when one could go to an Allen film and rightfully expect to encounter witty dialogue and a tapestry of interesting human relationships.
