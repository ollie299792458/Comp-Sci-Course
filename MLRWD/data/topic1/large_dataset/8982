In no way, shape, or form does it say in the trailer that this movie is going to be exactly like the book. It says that it is clearly based on the book. Another point, where, oh where does it say that this movie is a freakin' non-stop rollercoaster ride "Comedy", guess what...it doesn't. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it was exactly what I thought it would be, GENERALLY close to the book. The characters are excellent, the narration throughout the scenes call back to the days of the show "Wonder Years", which is still sadly not on DVD. The point is, I knew what I was getting into before I saw this movie. I, unlike most people who seem to have ripped this movie a new one without thinking, gave it a fair chance and didn't expect it to follow the book word for word. I also didn't already have a picture in my mind about what the characters from the book would looked like if they were transitioned to screen. Believe me, I can guarantee to anyone that if you had the above written expectations before seeing the movie, then there's no wonder it sucked for you.
