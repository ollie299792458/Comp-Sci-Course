I loved Kevin Spacey in this movie.  Was it the best movie I've ever seen - no.  Was it the best one Kevin Spacey has ever been in - no.  It was a really good movie with a very clear and convincing message that Kevin Spacey loved Bobby Darin.  Kevin is so wonderfully multi-talented that anything he does is worth seeing but he outdid himself here with the singing and dancing.  Kate Bosworth is a lovely and talented actress still coming into her own, but I was disappointed in her as a choice for Sanda Dee. She just does not pull off the Sanda Dee look.  She has way too "toothy" a smile and comes off in several scenes looking more like Tuesday Weld than pouty faced, doe eyed Sandra Dee.  I had to repeatedly remind myself which woman I was supposed to be seeing.  If they ever do a movie about Tuesday Weld then Kate should be at the head of the line for the part.  All in all - I was not disappointed in the movie and would highly recommend seeing it and enjoying Kevin Spacey's wonderful talent along with the talent of Bob Hoskins and John Goodman in two wonderful supporting roles.  I don't think the movie adds much new information on Darin but it was a joy to watch.
