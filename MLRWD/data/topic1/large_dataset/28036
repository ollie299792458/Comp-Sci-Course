Mixing elements from David Lynch's Dune, David Fincher's Alien 3, The Fugitive, Gladiator and The Man With No Name Westerns, Chronicles of Riddick is definitely worth watching just for the bad-azz title anti-hero and lavish production design .

It's basically about a wanted Furian convict who's destined to topple a feared galactic empire. Vicious and remorseless, Vin Diesel's character is definitely  not in Luke Skywalker's Friendster page. Along the way, he visits a prison planet and hooks up with the survivors of Pitch Black.  It's stuff of every fanboy's fantasy, but Riddick's detours make the story a little bit scattered. It's not as tight and efficient as his first appearance in Pitch Black. But it's still fast-paced and thrilling.

As expected, Riddick, just like Van Helsing, was lambasted by critics when it was shown in theaters. Maybe one must have had a steady diet of comics and sci-fi books growing up to fully appreciate the said movies. So if you're looking for heady sci-fi fare in the vein of  Gattaca, 2001: Space Odyssey, Twelve Monkeys, stay away. But if you're looking for a sci-fi actioner with a kick arse anti-hero and lots of eye candy, get this DVD along with Dark Fury and Pitch Black.
