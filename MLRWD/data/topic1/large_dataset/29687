Die Hard defines action.  It has everything that every action fan desires, such as explosions in an elevator shaft of the Nacatomi Plaza, where the story mainly takes place.  From the first moments of when John McClane enters Nocatomi Plaza at sunset, the journey begins.  And, a fast one, too. 
The terrorist group controlled by Hans Gruber, where they wanted the big bucks saved down in the vault of the plaza, decide to retrieve it, but they can't get the code, so they have to unlock the vault maunally -- this makes the plot so much more intersting.  Hans has that certain accent or personality that really makes this movie so much more intriguing.  
Now, John McClane must fight off those terrorists, then Hans, and make sure that he can save as many hostages as he can, but first, he wants to see his wife and his family, primarily.  But can he do just that? 
To do just that, it takes bravery.  This movie shows extreme examples of great fighting scenes between John and the terrorists, including some solo action from Sgt. Al Powell and his cop car...with the backup police in the rush with sirens blaring.  This movie makes a perfect example of what it's like to be surrounded by hostility, in a 40 story building.  
Great use of music too.  I was really impressed by the adrenaline-pumping music-orchestra type format for various scenes.  
Like I said, this movie defines action.  It has all the aspects of heart-pumping action, e.g., c-4 exploding in an elevator shaft, strategies made by John McClane and Hans at the same time, and the sheer amount of chaotic scenes makes this movie one heck of a great journey!
