Billy Bob Thorton, the "love 'im or hate 'im" oddball, bad boy of Hollywood, and tragic hero of "Man", mentions in the supplemental "Making Of.." section of the DVD that he immediately said "Yes" to starring in the Coens' latest opus, because the Coens never "suck". And how true that is. While some critics and Coen-affectionadoes alike deemed "Man" as not the best Coen Brothers flick, "The Man Who Wasn't There" has many positive points, and is a faithful contemporary film tribute to the great film noir movies of the 1930's and '40's ("Casablanca", "Big Sleep", etc.)
Set in a small California town, a no account barber (Thorton) suddenly finds his shave and a haircut world twisted and turned upside down by a series of incidents involving his misguided wife (McDormand), her big shot department store manager boss (Gandolfini), and a thrifty entrepreneur, which leads him down a dark tunnel of intrigue, sabotage, murder, and depravity. If the Coens remarkable sense of screenwriting, with such witty expressions and carefully brewed, slow roasted dialogue, humor, and for one of a better words "screen-play (just good fun filmmaking) doesn't ensnare you into this Coen flick, then Roger Deakins masterful photography will leave you spellbound. "Man" was hardly filmed in simple black and white, but a remarkably deep, forboding, and deliberate manipulation of darkness and light. "Man" then, transcends film, and becomes art, and it becomes clearly obvious Deakins and the Coens achieved what they set out to do here. 
Certainly a long shot departure from "O Brother", but not neglecting their own unique abilities to make us think as well as laugh at what we see and hear played out on the screen, the Coens have certainly created a film, or should I say "art film", that captivates us and shows us what exactly the art of filmmaking is. Yet another gleaming gem of a movie goes into the crown that is the Coen Brothers shimmering film repetiore.
