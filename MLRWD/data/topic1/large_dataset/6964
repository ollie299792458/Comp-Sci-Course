I really did enjoy this movie so don't let my 4/5 stars confuse you.  The acting in the movie is great Charlize Theron continues to prove that she is more than just another pretty faced actress. She has the talent and ability to make you just feel for her character.  Surprise supportive acting came from Frances McDormand and Sean Bean, by this I don't mean that it's a surprise they can act but rather I thought their character's side story (their love and her illness) was a nice addition to the movie.  As for the subject matter I doubt it would surprise anyone that I was sickened by the way women were treated in the work place.  What I don't understand is how much time do the men at the mine have on their hands that they spend all their time harassing the women? What's even more disturbing is that this movie takes place only about 30-25 years ago!  I would say you should definetly see this movie, there are some really compelling scenes that yes I admit it I cried during.  The only reason I gave it 4/5 is the story is pretty predictable and from the beginning I knew where it was going.  However it is still a great film with great performances.
