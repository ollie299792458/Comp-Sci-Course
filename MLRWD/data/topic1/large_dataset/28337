I couldn't finish watching this movie because of the serious inconsistancies with Scripture.  There were three advisors listed in the credits, two priests and a rabbi.  I wonder how these Catholic priests allowed their names to be associated with this movie.

You can say it is inspirational but if key details are wrong and false, it will ultimately not lead you closer to the Real Jesus because the details are important and relate to the Incarnation as foretold in the Old Testament.

Showed Joseph angry, accusational and cruel about Mary's pregancy

Omitted Elizabeths greeting of Mary as "Mother of My Lord"

Implied Mary had pain at childbirth

Omitted presentation in the Temple

Showed Mary as the decision maker in going to Egypt

Implied by Jesus' questions that he didn't know he was God.

You can learn much more about the life of Jesus looking through the eyes of Mary when you pray the Rosary (which after all is simply the prayer of the Gospel).
