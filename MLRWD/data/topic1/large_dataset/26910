I wanted to give this film a lower score but could not because it was well directed. The acting was well done. The cinematogrophy was well done. The music was decent. And for a gay film, that is incredible. The story was well done too but I felt the main character got off easy at times and there were some contrived situations as another poster stated.

It is a good coming out flick in some areas. And the acting and direction, etc, has a lot to do with it. But really, I think in a real world situation, the main character would be ostracized for how he acted with no feeling of remorse. Maybe it's a cultural thing.

My problems were with how Tobi acted. He was like an immature child AND everybody seemed to feed into that. Tobi needed to apologize to several people and own up to what he did. He needed to say sorry to: his team and the gay team for starting the fight, to Anke for leading her on and telling lies about their relationship (and he should be in gratitude for her not outing him and being a good friend), to the gay dude who he slept with because he led him on as well and hurt him (and that gay dude was just too giving, but I get it, wounded bird syndrome), to his best friend for so many things.

Just because you're having problems coming out does not give one a free pass to be a child and basically a douche.
