This one has everything:  Capt. Jean-Luc Picard and crew with a brand-new Enterprise-NCC 1701E (1701D was crashed in ST - Generations) and the new Enterprise is sleeker and more military looking with a smaller bridge as well and different design.  This story begins 6 years after the big battle with the Borg when Picard as "Locutus" had been forced to help the Borg.  Picard and crew are on a shakedown mission in the Neutral Zone when the Borg come back and are attacking earth.  The Enterprise races to help and are just in time to transport off the surviving crew of the Defiant (From Deep Space 9) including former crew member Commander Worf.  As Picard gives coordinates on the Borg ship for all the rest of the fleet to fire at to destroy the Borg cube, the Enterprise crew also notes a small sphere escaping the cube and heading toward Earth and producing some type of time warp.  Even as the Enterprise chase the sphere towards the time warp, they see the Earth change and suddenly it is 9 billion Borg and not humans inhabiting the planet!!  Of course, Picard & co. follow the Borg sphere into the past and destroy it but not before it has fired multiple times on a missile site in Montana.

What follows is classic ST:NG with humor, action and even a touch of romance.  Some of the best scenes include Lily (Alfre Woodard) from 21st century Earth on the Enterprise and viewing Earth from space, Counselor Deanna Troi falling face down drunk on a table while trying to keep up with Zephram Cochrane and Commander Worf's expression when told he is accompanying Picard on a space walk!!

Enjoy!!
