Bob Dylan has always been a contradiction and this excellent Scorcese documentary connects the earnestness and depth of the songwriting Dylan with the playful and elusive public persona.

If there were any criticism, I would say there was not enough music presented in its entirety (some musical cuts were too short; others were spoiled by voice overs).  However, the film as a whole is great.

As someone who lived through the period designing posters and saw Dylan both at the Club 47 Mt. Auburn in Cambridge and at Gerde's Folk City in the Village, I especially enjoyed seeing Dave Van Ronk talking about the times.  It would have been nice to see Van Ronk in context - singing "St. James Infirmary Blues" or "He was a Friend of MIne" to further the connection.

But there is only so much time availble in a two-hour format, and I feel that this will be the definitive Dylan film for some time to come.  I hope there will be a sequel to bring "Zimmy" through the early years of this century as well.
