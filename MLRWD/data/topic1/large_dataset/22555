...but I love this movie! Well-acted, spectacular scenery and a few unexpected surprises -- this movie holds up very well after nearly 50 years.
Okay, to the plot -- Charlie Olnutt (Humphrey Bogart) is the  carefree, Canadian gin-swilling skipper of the "African Queen", a  beat-up mail steamer that plies the rivers of East Africa at the beginning  of World War I.  Rose (Katherine Hepburn) is a prim British missionary, who  hitches a ride with Olnutt when her missionary brother dies after an  encounter with German soldiers.  However, the two have very different ideas  on how to proceed.  Olnutt is content to wait out the war in a remote spot  along the river.  Rose believes the two should somehow contribute to the  war effort.  Eventually, the pair agree to rig the African Queen with two  homemade torpedoes in order to destroy a large German steamship which is  prowling Lake Victoria.  But getting to the lake just as dangerous.  Charlie and Rose find themselves battling deadly rapids, crocodiles,  leeches, a German fort and each other on their journey.
My favorite scene  is when Charlie calls Rose a "skinny old maid".  Rose's chin  quivers, but then she collects herself -- and makes Charlie pay.
A very  memorable movie that is well worth the money.
