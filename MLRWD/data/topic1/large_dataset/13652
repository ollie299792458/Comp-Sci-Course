Going to school and taking drills to hide under your desk from the inevitable nuclear holocaust was traumatic and evidence of the major military propaganda we were doomed to be annihilated.  Our only hope was to bomb the Hell Out of the Russkies before they did.!

When Dr. Strangelove came out, it was a breath of fresh air that if we continued to trust the "military solution" we were indeed doomed to annihilation.

Unfortunately we did not learn from history and were to repeat our military bombing solutions.  More bombs were dropped on Vietnam than all of WWII.  Over 4 million Vietnamese were slaughtered in the name of democracy and capitalism.

Once again today in Iraq, Iran, etc etc, we are told the solution to people disagreeing with our lifestyle is to bomb and kill them into submission, to make the world safe for democratic dictatorships and American businesses.

Dr Strangelove is just as important today, as an absurd black comedy of the American version of safety from terrorism as it was over 40 years ago.

Watch it, enjoy, and remember:  "People should not fear government, the government should fear the people".
