Sting is Frankenstein who decides to create a mate for his first monster. There are 2 stories going on at the same time. One is about the woman Frankenstein creates and the other is the fate of his first monster who finds a friend and joins the circus. Frankenstein names his female creation Eva and decides to teach her to be an equal to men. He educates her and spends a lot of time with her as he finds himself in love with her. The movie cuts back and forth from one story to the other. In my opinion the "run away and join the circus" story takes away the intensity of the horror that Frankenstein is all about. The monster, Victor never forgets Eva and dreams of finding her again but is afraid she will reject him as she is so beautiful and he knows he is ugly. As Eva gains confidence and knowledge she begins to hate Frankenstein. She is horrified when she realizes the truth about her origins. They have fight at the end; "You did not create me." She screams and Frankenstein answers, "As a matter of fact, I did." Eva meets Victor at the end.
