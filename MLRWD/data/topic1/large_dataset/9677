Hello Folks,
I want to thank MGM  for this release....they really got it right!
first off...
all the excellent bonus features from the 25th Anniversary edition..
the 30 minute on camera commentary by Stallone, the tributes to Burgess Meredith, the cinematographer James Crabbe and Bill Conti..ALL made it to this edition...which means you don't have to hold onto older inferior editions to have all the bonus features...and this IS a big deal.  Too many recent DVD editions of movies lose old features which make keeping mutliple copies essential and that stinks.
The extra features are really too  many to list...multiple commentaries..and the Stallone alone is worth the update...its truly like watching the movie with him  in  the room...WOW!
all the past trailers...the appearance on  the Dinah Shore show..featurettes...this is a NO BRAINER for fans of the movie.

The three part "making of" which runs about an hour and half and  features the main players is extraordinary in its revelations about the movie and the craft of making movies and WHY this was a million to one chance and WHY their lack of budget actually helped  in  many ways.  The twenty minute documentary on the Steadicam and its inventor ...who filmed his demo on the art museum steps before heading to Hollywood....its just proof that all the planets lined up for this one!
For those out there bitching about the upgraded releases of DVDs...don't buy em...for those of us who love the movies...these higher quality releases are very welcome.  I  picked this 2 disc set up for $15 at Target...and there are hours of features...WHAT A DEAL!

If you love the movie...get this version.
if you don't care about bonus features...stick with your old copy.
