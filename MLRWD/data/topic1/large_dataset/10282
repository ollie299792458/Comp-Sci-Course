This film was made on a very large scale, but not quite the epic scale of Lawrence of Arabia. Also, the dialogue is not quite as sharp as David Lean's Lawrence. There's a depth there that's missing here.

Still, this is a perfectly good combination of action, history, and political maneuvering. A very enjoyable evening's entertainment.

Although Ben-Hur is my favorite film, and Chuck Heston will be best remembered as Moses, I believe Chinese Gordon is one of Heston's best performances on film. He's even better in A Touch of Evil, but very good in Khartoum.

This story is tragic, but Gordon's heroism and determination make it seem more triumphant than tragic. As a man of conviction and honor who stood up to Muslim fanatics, even without the support of his government, he stands as a lesson for today. He did not cower in the face of barbarism. He confronted it head on, no matter the personal cost.

I don't know how many Disney movies I've watched with the trite theme "Follow Your Heart." "Chinese" Gordon followed his heart. A very large heart it was, loyal to the land and people he loved, to the bitter end.
