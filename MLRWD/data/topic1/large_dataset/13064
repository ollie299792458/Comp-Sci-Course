Having known little about the past and current history of the civil war in Sudan, I was immensely enlightened about the struggle, pain, courage, and determination of the Lost Boys of Sudan, specifically the group of boys this film followed.  This wonderfully done documentary reveals the reality these boys went through - from their journey 1000 across the desert into Ethiopia and Kenya, to their difficult adjustment and hard work in America and their road to a brighter future.

This documentary is so poignant and both heartwarming and heartwrenching, and made me more appreciative of my life here in America and more aware of the horrendous experiences of others hurt by war, conflict, and poverty.  And while I cried for the suffering of the Lost Boys, I also cried joyful tears for the good they achieved, and their determination, courage, and hard work of these men left me feeling hopeful - for despite the immense physical, mental, and spiritual pain they suffered, these men remained selfless, giving, kind, and never gave up.

Everyone should see the movie, if for nothing else than to increase awareness about the struggles of others and our need to reach out to them.
