As I write this, I am listening to Derek and The Dominoes' LAYLA (piano exit) and I am reminded of what Akira Kurosawa called "Cinematic Beauty" and there are moments in GOODFELLAS that are pure cinematic beauty (uncovering of Jimmy's victims as the piano plays its wistful melody)...and if you don't know what sequence I am talking about, I envy you because I want to know what it feels like to watch this masterpiece for the first time all over again.

One of the best movies ever made and directed by a master at the peak of his power and passion.....GOODFELLAS finally has the dvd treatment it has deserved for a long time...only reason this isn't in my dvd collection because I knew it was only a matter of time before someone at Warner's was smart enough to put this together...like the other fella on this board, I am counting the days until I have this treasure in my hands.

How can you not be excited about this movie getting a special dvd treatment. I am a movie fan awaiting AN EVENT!!!

Decades and decades from now, people will be watching movies directed by people not even born yet who will be influenced by this landmark

GREAT GREAT GREAT movie.

NOW GO GET YOUR ******* SHINEBOX!!
