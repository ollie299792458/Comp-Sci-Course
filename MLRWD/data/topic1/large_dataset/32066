I loved this show and taped it when it aired.  And It's just as good as I remembered.  The writing, acting and directing on the show totally draws you in and really makes you hurt from the fact that you won't be able to share in more of the characters' lives now that the series is cancelled. The characters were so interesting, Alva Keel the enigmatic super genius, Evie Santos the ex-cop but feminine balance to the group and Paul Callan he who (with 6 other hemographists) has something to do with the end of the world.

I give it a 4 because the aired episodes were great but the some of the unaired episodes were a bit bland (even for the subtle, laid-back storytelling style).

Miracles is not a religious series, but it's just so lightly religiously flavored that it makes a Catholic like me feel at home.  Just as an aside, I really liked how it was respectable to the Catholic church in the series.  Portraying it as an standpoint standpoint of faith, but not villifying it like some judgmental and condemning institution. It was small touches like this to the show and it's themes that make the show so different that what you would normally see on TV.

I guess if you guys are looking for something along this line...Supernatural on the WB network is a much much dramatically scaled down, younger-handsome lead version of Miracles.  (They've already copied some of plots from Miracles including an abused kid taking paranormal revenge, like in the Bone Scatterer episode and the constant use of supernatural entities referring to the whereabouts of lead characters' loved ones.)
