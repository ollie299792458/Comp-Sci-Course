This movie was a very pleasant surprise. It is a strange mix of film noir and black comedy but it actually worked. This is also the directorial debut of Shane Black (Writer of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000G3PL">Lethal Weapon - The Complete Series</a>).

The good: This movie is all about the dialogue and the way it is delivered was great. Val Kilmer delivers his lines in a deadpan, sarcastic manner which was very funny. The exchanges between Downer Jr and Monaghan were entertaining as well. The story although slightly convoluted towards the end was actually strong. The manly man will also be delighted to know that this movie reaches the minimum T & A requirement as well though for some this may be considered bad.

The bad: Nothing memorable.

Overall: This movie is all about tone and dialogue. As long as you don't go into it expecting Oscar gold or something that is intended to be taken 100% seriously you should enjoy this movie. Give it a try!
