Let me say right off the bat that I really liked Gerry's review. I myself have been a student of Tae-Kwon-Do, however my knowledge of other martial arts is very limited, unfortunately. His angle is refreshing - what a shame we can't make movies in that way! THE ONE is the kind of movie that I, myself have dreamed of making since more than ten years ago. Something that is totally over-the-edge. The fact that this movie is PG-13 (and to me, really IS PG-13) and has no abundance of cursing and void of sexual situation is mind-boggling. When was the last time Hollywood placed a big action star in a blockbuster film like that? It doesn't happen very often. As always, Jet Li's performance floors me, and of course I want him to be in one of my movies. As an aspiring filmmaker, I have no interest in merely making a movie for profit, I would also like to make great films that people can actually get something good from. Jet Li is already one of my favorite stars, probably the first Easterner I've been awed by since Toshiro Mifune (who is still my favorite actor). THE ONE is definitely a great movie, and you can't go into watching it with the mindset of a person who has no imagination. Open your mind and really try to believe everything you're seeing. The film will blow you away. ba@megadeth.com
