Redford has attempted to present Norman Maclean's family story <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226500667">A River Runs through It and Other Stories, Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition</a> on film, and has achieved phenomenal success. I ordered the video at the suggestion of a respected friend, but with a negative bias against the willingness and/or ability of any Hollywood producer to adeqately film this novella, itself perhaps the epitome of the storyteller's art.

I suggest that anyone interested in this modern classic to read the book first, slowly, savoring Maclean's wonderful, yet economical, descriptive style, then to relax with the video while the book is fresh in the memory. Redford's translation of this story from the language of the written word to the language of the movie is as faithful and accurate as can be done.

Every translation is, of course, also an interpretation, and Robert Redford has accurately interpreted Norman Maclain's family story so that the video production enhances the enjoyment and appreciation of the original work, the book.
