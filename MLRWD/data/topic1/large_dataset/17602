First off, I was disappointed with this adaptation of Hillenbrand's well written bio. Maybe because I read the book first, enjoying the authors obvious love of horses and extensive reasearch she and her "helpers" did. I don't know, I found the direction and writing filled with too many Hollywood cliches. Ross' annoying direction, moving the camera in a haphazard way, giving the impression to me that alot of the scenes seemed like practice shots, testing how the camera should move. In some ways, his direction reminds me of William Shatner's direction on Star Trek V. The camera moves with no purpose, and it should. Also, I thought the music score was all wrong for the film. A score can help a story, but Newman's music appears to show the films flaws even more. Overall, I liked the story and the cast, though I felt Ross took a lot of liberties. Which,most of the time, does not bother me. I realize compressing a book to give it a linear feel on the silver screen sometimes calls for such alterations, but I felt they hindered the film -including Macy's turn as the radio announcer, a completely made up character. I was reminded through the whole film of Bob Ueker's role in the Major League films. This was a drama, filled with many hard realities -like the weight issue which seemed to glossed over also - and adding a character that would not have been out of place in A League of Their Own was a lame attempt at adding humor.
