This movie comes from the book "Red Dragon", an excellent read.  However, this is not a good translation of the book.  The character central to the book, Francis Dollarhyde, is not explained at all in the movie.  You get no real motivation as to why he is the way he is.  You don't get the connection to the painting "The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun".  You don't learn about the abuses of his grandmother.  You don't get the explanation behind the teeth that he uses to bite his victims with.  These were all very central to the character's development.  Without them, he was just a creepy guy.  (You get more evil characters out of Batman cartoons.)
Instead, the movie focuses more on Will Graham and his journey.  He is not that interesting of a person, either.  At least, not enough to dedicate a whole movie to.
I am a fan of Brian Cox, but he did not ooze the quiet evil that Sir Anthony Hopkins did in "The Silence of the Lambs".  So as a whole, the characters were not engaging.
And then there is the ending; the big shock at the end of the book was wasted.  The movie had the typical stylized Hollywood ending that made me cringe.  Not to mention the director's need to linger on a closing shot of the happy-family-in-paradise a good fifteen seconds too long.  Michael Mann may have redeemed himself on later movies, but with Manhunter, you got the Miami Vice, 80's quasi-style of directing.
Manhunter is not a scary movie, not a taut movie, not a frightening movie, nor an intense movie.  What is it then?  A dull shell of what could have been.  Save your time; read the book.
