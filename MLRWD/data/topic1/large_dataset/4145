Sometime in the early 80's in New York I was working on something and looked up at the TV because I knew I recognized that man speaking ... who is that?  Oh right!  That's George Smiley!  What's he doing on TV?
Guinness captures Smiley so perfectly, so completely, that it was the character I recognized and not the actor. Only then, of course, did the penny drop and I realized what I was watching.  It's among my top 5 favorite novels of all time, and this production fully captures the delightfully intricate plot-within-plot-within-plot.
The casting is exemplary and the acting and direction are superb examples of what one has come to, if not expect then certainly hope for from the land of the RSC.
If you know the books, you will not be disappointed.  Stop reading this and click on "add to your cart".
Several years ago I discovered this production on PAL video (not NTSC as we use here in the States).  I unhesitatingly purchased a universal VHS machine solely so that I could watch this series, which I purchased from Amazon UK.  I've watched it lovingly perhaps 6 times.
Anybody wanna buy some used tapes? :-)
