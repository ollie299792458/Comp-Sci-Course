I am in my 50's and was born and raised in the '50s.  My father used to tell me that, in the '40s, he had "fallen in love" with the actress Rita Hayworth from watching her movies.  I didn't get it.

Flash forward to the new millenium.  In David Lynch's enigmatic and erotic masterpiece "Mulholland Drive", a beautiful brunette amnesiac sees a movie poster of "Gilda", starring Rita Hayworth, on a bathroom wall and spontaneously takes the name "Rita" for herself.  Why?  Was there any significance or meaning in that choice of movie posters?...that choice of names?  You bet your sweet sex goddess there was!

David Lynch knew what my father knew: Rita Hayworth was a hottie to men returning  from World War II, and in "Gilda", it is captured for all time.  Now I get it.  Gilda is what did it.  A "wild child" before the term was coined, Rita Hayworth radiates like a Chernobyl of sensuality.

See this movie and you'll find out what your grandfather, your father, David Lynch, and I found out!
