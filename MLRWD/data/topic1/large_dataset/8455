This is a very entertaining movie, but almost every event in it has a parallel from the first movie.  Kevin, still disgruntled over being made the family scapegoat, hates his family's guts and wishes them away.  Through a mishap at the airport, his wish comes true again!  Unfortunately, his old friends, the Wet Bandits, are back and are out for revenge, big time.  Still, even though this movie is a rehash, it improves over the first.  Kevin uses a gangster movie to scare away uninvited guests, like in the first.  Kevin encounters an eccentric outcast who scares him at first, but ends up teaching him an important life lesson and comes to his rescue when the bad guys finally catch him.  Again, like the first HA.  And of course, what Home Alone movie would be complete without a house full of booby traps to tear the bandits to pieces?

My one complaint is that HA2 is much darker and grittier than HA1.  This time, the bad guys don't merely want to hurt Kevin, they actually intend to kill him.  The scene where Harry pulls a gun on Kevin went beyond bad taste for me.  Also, the traps Kevin sets this time are much more dangerous (and funny), and would easily kill someone in real life.

Still, it's worth your time watching this holiday season.
