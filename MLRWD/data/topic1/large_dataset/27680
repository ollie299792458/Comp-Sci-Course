For all the detractors of this actress out there- learn to seperate personal opinions based on misunderstood reports of a celebrity's private life and that of her worth as an actress when reviewing her work.

This could be the turning point in  Miss Lohan's career as she is moving away from this kind of storyline and into more mature roles in the coming year.

However, this should not take away your enjoyment of FULLY LOADED, which is a clever little tale that reinvents the classic Herbie the Love Bug for a new generation.

Lohan is supported expertly by  Michael Keaton who, as her father, forbids her to follow in his footsteps as a NASCAR racer. But fate-and a certain persistent car long thought destroyed- enters her life  and  shows her how to not only have fun but to enjoy doing what she is best at!

A fun ride if you dont think too much about it and take it for what it is-enjoyable entertainment. Here's to Lindsay and her future as one of the rising stars of our age!
