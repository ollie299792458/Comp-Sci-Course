This movie-"The Straight Story" I purchased online through Amazon is one of the Best I have seen in a long time.I am not much of a movie watcher-but after recently losing a dear Friend and Supervisor where I worked to cancer...I happened by chance to see some of this Movie on TV one night.It was a workday weeknight and it came on later in the evening,so I stayed up as long as I could to see it...but having to be up at 4AM to go to work...I had to not see it all.I found it after it had started as well,so I had no idea of it's name.

The story though...was amazing!...and the actors in it were so "Real People"and mostly,the Character Alvin Straight.I was stunned!....Not only did he have the same personality and almost the very same voice as my Friend Dennis...he also looked like Denis and his mannerisms and way of thinking...his quiet yet sensible demeanor and way of looking at life and daily troubles were so much like my Friend...it left me feeling hard to believe I wasn't looking and hearing my Friend Dennis.

If I didn't know it wasn't Dennis...I would have thought it was a small clip out of his life on film.My Friend even lived in the Country too.
I found out about 2 years after seeing this movie on TV as I described...and by mentioning it in conversation whilst reminiscing about my Supervisor/Friend with another fellow worker and Friend,he suggested I go to go to Google and type in what the story was about..."Man travels across country on a John Deer Tractor"...in an instant...this movie was found.

I ordered 2 copies and received them in about 1 and 1/2 weeks time.Except for some inside damage to the actual DVD cases...(The small button pop in the middle that holds the DVDs in place were broken on each one-so the DVDs and the broken piece were rattling around inside the packages loose)I played one of them,there was no damage to the DVD that affected the playing of the movie...It was as if I had experienced a visit with my Buddy Dennis.I gave the second copy I purchased to my Friend's Wife and Daughter and Grandson.I am not one to watch a movie twice but this one-because of the personal Connection it made with me is so well done-I will watch it from time to time as a reminder of my Buddy Dennis.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Z4SD">The Straight Story</a>

Beautifully done,this movie is one the entire family can enjoy...it is a real escape from the harshness of today's world and I highly recommend it.The messages you will receive from this video will warm your heart and mabey some of it will even rub off on the way you think of each other as people.Especially when it comes to the importance of patching up differences with estranged Family and Friend's in our Life.There is some dry humor and some valuable life lesson's in it.Everyone who is looking for an escape to simpler times and way of Life and what's really important should watch this....
