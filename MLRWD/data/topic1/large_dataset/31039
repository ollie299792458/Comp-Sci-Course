This is my favorite film of all time, and for good reason.  Watching it again today, I realized that there is not one scene in Bonnie and Clyde that could have been cut.  Every single scene is essential for character or plot development.  This movie does not spell things out for you; it shows you things and lets you draw your own conclusions.  Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty's performances are simply incredible; so are everyone else's.  There is not one bad actor in the batch, not even among the extras.  The film has an authentic look: apparently it was filmed in towns where the real Bonnie and Clyde visited some thirty years earlier.  Criminals can feel and love and laugh and hurt too, just as much as any law-abiding person, and this movie will remind you of that.  You will be as frustrated with Blanche as Bonnie is; you will grin tolerantly at Buck's milk joke; you will gasp at the carnage and feel your heart soften at the naive sweetness of C.W. Moss.

This is a must-see movie for anyone who enjoys good acting, plotting, filming, editing, scripting, music and scenery.  One of the best films ever made.
