I first saw "Carnival of Souls" on the late-night show of I forgot which Australian channel. Black and white, as the original. We didn't have colour TV back then (it must have been 1969).

Wow! Eerie, haunting, and the sound track disturbing, but spot on, jarring, but rightly so, almost as jarring as Kurt Weil's "Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny", or Shostakovich's "Charge of the Teutonic Knights" in Eisenstein's "Alexandr Nevski". Did I write "almost as jarring"? Quite as jarring.

What is it about? A woman who drives off a bridge, into the river below, and is rescued.

Now, spoiler ahead....

Do you really want to know?

It is still time...

All right, here it is...

She has not been rescued, she has died, but she does not know it. The whole film is about how she slowly fades away from the world of the living, until she  ends up in the carnival of souls  (a carousel) where she is torn apart by the dead.

No horror, no special effects, only subdued terror.

I was so happy when I found this DVD in some shop, almost 30 years later, going for a song  ($10 or so). If you do happen across it, do not hesitate one moment.
