Good science fiction films are rare, great science fictions films are ever rarer -- so do yourself a favor and see this movie!

I loved the atmosphere of this movie which captured the old school feeling quite well. They even threw some original "Solaris" stuff in there which impressed me. The film was satisfying, as it was not just a soap opera in space -- science was an integral part of the plot. Plus, it was scary, which is a must for me in a science fiction film. They even included the requisite robot character, but made the character fresh and new. The emotives were a fantastic touch, BTW.

The humorous moments sprinkled into the film were well done and much appreciated. In fact, the last line in the movie is humorous; a clever and intriguing way to end the film.

These guys must have watched every good science fiction film ever made to be able to create this movie so effectively. They even worked in elements from movies that I liked, and are good, but that are not considered "great" or canonical such as "Total Recall". These guys knew what they were doing and this movie shows it.
