There are several reasons I like this movie.  1) Trevanian wrote the book (trashy, pulp spy fiction...great for a mindless romp into the 60's), Clint Eastwood is in it (not the greatest actor, but he's got a good track record, and he enjoys the craft) 3) The Eiger has always intrigued me 4) I used to climb (age has curtailed my abilities) and 5) My 3rd cousin (Heidi Bruhl) is in it, albeit she plays a trampy wife, but she's my 3rd cousin nonetheless.  I like Lee Marvin "flicks" too, my taste in music is much better.  Oh sure I enjoy the Hamlets, and Much ado's etc...  but we're talking American genre "flicks", not works of cinema etc...  flicks..  you know EZ rider, Bronson movies stuff like that.  That said...  (SERIOUSLY)  I remember a climbing book about the making of this movie... and the technical challenges for making some of these scenes on cliff faces and on the Eiger itself were well documented.  The challenges were overcome, which and certainly took a bit of skill and logistics to pull it off.  Not bad for a "B" movie as described by several reviewers... taking everything into consideration this movie was quite an undertaking, Eastwood didn't write it, he just made it happen.  Guy flick?  okay, whatever.
