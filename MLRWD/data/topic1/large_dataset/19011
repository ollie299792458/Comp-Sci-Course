As someone who spent 10 years working as a professional arts administrator for both a large opera company (with an even larger operating budget) and a small "off-off Broadway" theatre (with an even smaller operating budget), I found "Slings and Arrows" a funny and often touching portrayal of the daily chaos that surrounds non-profit arts organizations.  What I really love about this series is that it is never mean spirited or attacking and each character has at their core a real passion for the craft. Even the "divas" and "corporate brown nosers" ultimately are portrayed with redeemable characteristics.

There were many occasions that I laughed out loud, paused the DVD player and shouted an emphatic "YES!" in agreement with the realistic depiction of this surreal business we call "show."

Whether you have worked in the arts, are a patron of the arts, or simply love a great ensemble cast comedy, please do yourself a favor and watch all three seasons of "Slings and Arrows."  Give yourself a nice block of time to watch this series, though...it's like the potato chips...no one can watch just one!  My husband and I watch all three seasons in the course of one weekend "marathon" style.
