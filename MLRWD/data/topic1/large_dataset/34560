In the adapatation of John Le Carr&eacute;'s muckraking novel The Constant Gardener, Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles  and cinematographer Cesar Charlone shot the shantytown of Nairobi (and a range of other locales) like the favelas of Rio in their much-lauded "City of God." As Justin Quayle, Ralph Fiennes suffers some more (yes, he does it well, having had a whole lot of practice) and (less usually) is stirred to action after the murder of his beloved wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz in a part for which she won a best supporting actress even though she is the female lead and almost the only female character). Well, nominally it was an automobile accident, though she was raped and mutilated, because "there are no murders in Africa, only regrettable deaths."

I don't think that it is a secret that the nefarious conduct of clinical trials in Africa is the muck Le Carr&eacute;'s best-selling book raked. The movie's editing seems to be to be unnecessarily jagged, but I soon was able to sort out the chronology of the flashbacks and the transformation of the ever-so polite low-level British diplomat (Fiennes) pulled out of his garden.

As a "thriller," the movie takes its time getting going, but Le Carr&eacute; is not the typical "thriller" writer. And his romances generally seem more schematic than heartfelt, which is exacerbated by the casting of the cold fish (if often yearning) Ralph Fiennes.

The DVD bonus features have considerable overlap. The best is the one that focuses on Le Carre, who pronounces himself more satisfied with the adaptation than of any of the other (many!) screen adaptations of his novels. (I'll stick with "The Spy Who Came in from the Cold" for that accolade, while wishing that "The Little Drummer Girl" was both a better movie and that Le Carre's book was read more these days,  as it is even more relevant than The Constant Gardener .) Also notable is that Ralph Fiennes has a smile other than the pained one he usually delivers in movies.
