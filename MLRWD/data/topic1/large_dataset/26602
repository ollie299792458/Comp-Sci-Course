I wrote about this film in reply to someone else's comment elsewhere here. It is a flawed gem. I give it 4 stars for reasons I mention there. I give the edited DVD version 1 star for being edited.

Ridiculous that history is being rewritten even for things that don't really matter.

Yes, I saw the scene where she sawed off her own arm years ago when I first watched it on with my daughter. When I watched the DVD a few weeks before Christmas this year because that was the *only* scene I remembered from this movie and I wanted to pay more attention to it this time around, I found to my shock the scene had been deleted. It's so obvious too... quick cut to her suddenly having an arm wrapped up.

Am I the only one who saw that scene? No. Others have as well and have said so here and on IMDB only to be ridiculed and told that even the director said there was never such a scene in the film.

You can find the Lena Olin interview with Leno on lenaolin dot net, under the Lena Olin Articles. Quoted here:

Jay: You do a lot of fighting in this (meaning Romeo Is Bleeding). I was telling the audience before the show, this is the strangest character. I guess it would be, you play this female mob boss. Would that be?

Lena: Yeah, that's correct.

Jay: Who is like the toughest person I've ever seen in a movie. Am I giving it away by saying...
(makes cutting motion on his arm)

Lena: No, no no. (highly amused by all this talk of Mona)

Jay: I mean, she cuts her own arm off with a saw, to kind of make a point I guess.

(Lena laughs)
