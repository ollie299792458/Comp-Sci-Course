"Gilda" was Rita Hayworth's vehicle to
cinematic immortality. She plays the
Grande Dame of Femme Fatale; the seductive
High Priestess of all bad girls and
Women of the world.  Blatant voyeurism
is more than justified when it comes to
reasons for watching this film. Hayworth is
perfect and she strolls through this movie
with the confidence and sex appeal of a
super model down a runway.

The plot is no disappointment, either. Johnny Farrell (Glen Ford)
wears multiple hats: first, Gilda's "chaperone/protector,"
and later, her husband. In between, Gilda makes
life hell for Johnny (the man who wronged her way back when)
by leading a care-free life of hedonism;
at Johnny's emotional expense, no less. The two are later married
after Ballin Mundson (Gilda's husband and Johnny's boss) fakes his
death to escape the law.  Johnny inflicts emotional anguish on
Gilda by restricting her freedom. Gilda rebels and runs away. Her
famous "Put the Blame on Mame" striptrease is her classic
statement of rebellion. From there, more clever twists
and turns finally result in Gilda and Johnny finally recognizing
their true love for each other.

Don't think twice; get this movie. It's guaranteed enjoyment
for any fan of Hollywood's silver screen era. It's also
a "must-buy" for Rita Hayworth fans.
