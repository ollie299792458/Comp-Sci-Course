If you read John Irving's books, you'll encounter quotes like these from time to time - all humorous, serious and significant to the story. Irving 's orphan heroes are made to feel that despite being 'unwanted' by society, they were given the most regal title by Dr. Larch so they know they are loved and important. Dr. Larch knows about people and their flaws, and life and it's inevitable tragedies and miracles. You have the same chance of being brought up in riches as you do being raised in an orphanage. Circumstances create all kinds of situations where your life (or death) could change with one mistake or 'choice'.

Irving himself grew up a princely comfortable life in New England, and many of his stories take place in his home state (New Hampshire) and surrounding Maine, Vermont, Rhode Island, Massachusetts. He often depicts likeable, quirky characters brought up in 'provincial' New England. That being said, I can attest that Irving is no snob. He's a brilliant writer and his books are among my favs! A Prayer For Owen Meany is a treasure! ~ Enjoy this book and 'spot on' screenplay/film!  Jayne Tyau
