I just watched this movie recently on the Hallmark Channel, just prior to ordering the DVD.  This movie is really well done.  All of the characters are well-developed, and even the child characters/actors do a terrific job of being believable and very likable.  My favorite character, of course, is Cassandra herself.  There is just something about her; she seems to cast a "spell" over almost everyone in town (except for the mayor's wife), and I couldn't help falling in love with her along with them!  Catherine Bell is wonderful in this role, and I also loved Chris Potter as the sheriff.  I would love to own the next two movies on DVD, "The Good Witch's Garden" and "The Good Witch's Gift".  Unfortunately, they are not available right now, but I am hoping they'll be out before the fourth movie debuts on the Hallmark Channel in October.  I have only seen the first movie, but I've heard the others are also very good.  If you haven't checked them out yet, you really should give "The Good Witch" a try.
