This is the film that set the pace for German expressionistic films. Its dark, its creepy, its strange. Its Edward Gory meets Frankenstein. If you like Tim Burtons work, you will appreciate the skewed perspectives, the painted sets, and the Edward Scissorhads-esque "Somnambulist". In a world where nothing is as it seems and nightmares are reality, Robert Wiene takes you to the edge of sanity and hurls you off the ledge.

This is the digitally mastered version of the 1923 German re-issue of the 1919 original. I'd call it a black and white silent film, but it has been tinted in sepia, purple, and green at times supposedly to better reflect the original director's intent. This version also has a new score by Timothy Brock which fits the eerie film very well, in my opinion. Very avant-garde.

*As a bonus, this edition also has an excerpt of another Wiene film "Genuine" whish is supposedly about a vampire, but theres not enough footage to really tell you what its about- only teases you and leaves you wanting more.
