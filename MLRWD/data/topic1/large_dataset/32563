I gave this movie one star because that's the fewest I could give it.  This movie reeks.  Sorry, but if you are a Julia Roberts fan buy or rent Pretty Woman or Erin Brokavich.  If you are a Brad Pitt fan, go back to Legends of the Fall or even  12 Monkeys.  This is mindless boring tripe.  Rather than describe the whole story, which the other reviews do, I'll just tell you this: the characters are boring, the premise is boring, the acting is boring, and the photography is average to poor.  The actors are wasted on this movie and give average effort to help you get into their characters.  By the end of the movie I was bummed because the only interesting character was killed off - the hitman AND HE WAS GAY.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  But you get the idea - put in a cliche character to spark some interest because the basic idea doesn't do it.  
If you really must see it for yourself do so with a "rent one get one free" deal.  Or buy my copy, which I foolishly bought for a lady friend who didn't like it.
