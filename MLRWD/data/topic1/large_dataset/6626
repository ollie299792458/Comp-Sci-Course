I have never written an online reveiw and never intended too, but this film was so terrible, brutal and boring (which is an amazing combination in itself) that as a service to other people who enjoyed this directors later film "spring, summer, fall, winter...and spring" I felt compelled to issue this warning.

  This is perhaps the worst film I have seen in years.  In this film you will see the following: several live fish caught, thrown onto a dock and hacked to pieces with a knife as the flop around, a bird drown in its cage, a woman insert fish hooks into her vagina and yank on the fish line to set them in, a man deficate (shot up from below so you miss nothing) another fish thrown on the floor and having battery cables attached, a dog beaten, women slapped and degrated, and a frog having his brains bashed in as he is slammed against a rock and then skinned.

  And in spite of all this sadistic stuff going on, I was bored. This is truly a piece of crap. I will not even address the plot as it is already reveiwed many time. But if you are looking for horror, look elsewhere, every death, man and animal, is shot in a slow drawn out distant way. Not scary.

 Is there nudity and sex, yes shot in the same ditracted slow boing way.

 I am not sayiny that this movie isn't making some kind of statement, just that the statement is brutal and slow and shallow.

 Oh and I forgot to mention the fish that is cut into sushi and eaten while alive, but not enough to kill it, and then allowed to swim away with huge gashes of flesh missing on either side.

 I am not some peta vegan liberal tree hugger but the cruelty inflicted (not FX) on the animals in this film just to try to fill up boring gaps in this boring piece of crap is disgusting.

 There are better films than this to see, try "vertcal ray of the sun" for instance.
