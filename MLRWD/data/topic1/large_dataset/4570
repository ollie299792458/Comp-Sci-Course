This has got to be my all time favorite movie.  It is the classic story of a white not quite spoiled teen-age girl whose parents are divorced.  Sara (Stiles) is a ballet dancer.  Her dream was to be "the prima ballerina." While she is trying out for the world famous dace school Julliard, her mother is rushing to see her audition.  Sara messes up the audition while her mother dies in a car crash.  Sara is positively devastated and holds herself responsible.
Sara is forced to move in with her clueless musician father, played by Terry Kinney.  She moves into a black neighborhood and attends a black school.  After her new friends (one of which becomes a main character called Chenille who is played by Kerry Washington) see her show off in gym they invite her to a local dance club called Steps.  After acquiring a fake ID and convincing Derek (Sean Patrick Tomas), Chenille's brother that she can dance his style, hip hop. Derek invites her to dance, but she is obviously lost, while Niki, Derek's ex-girlfriend, shows off her flawless moves.
Derek offers to teach Sara how to dance.  When she accepts sparks fly, but not just between Sara and Derek, but between Niki and Derek too.
Nobody wants Sara and Derek to be together especially not Malaka, Derek's best friend.  While Derek tries to decide what he wants to do, Sara goes after her old dance dreams.
Although there is a lot of dancing there is the controversy of thug life, drive-bys, and explosions.
