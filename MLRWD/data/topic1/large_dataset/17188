Many reviewers will compare Julia Roberts's performance to her more popular films, but stating that this is her best film since "Pretty  Woman" would gloss over how unique a film experience "Erin  Brockovich" (DVD) is. Having never been a fan of Roberts, I avoided  the theatrical release only to be extraordinarily surprised upon seeing it  by how well she served the role. Roberts delivers her usual charisma, but  also brings an unexpectedly believeable balance of strength and tenderness.  Brockovich is a broke single mother who achieved a sort of excellence out  of desperation, hunger, and necessity. Roberts's Brockovich is an admirably  flawed and driven woman who bludgeons men with her bravado and sexuality  without any false neo-feminism nor teary-eyed victimhood so obligatory in  female lead roles.
Brockovich is real, fighting the "big  polluter", yet director Soderberg manages to give the viewer all they  need to have genuine empathy for Brockovich without preaching the virtue of  the small town and the single mother versus the implacable corporate  entity. No, forget the movie-of-the-week conventions. Similar to "A  Civil Action", EB is character driven from Finney's reluctant boss,  the chameleon-like Aaron Eckhart's long suffering boyfriend to Marg  Hegenberger's horrified realization at the swimming pool. This film depicts  how the law works for real people without boring courtroom drama.
The DVD  does not contain flashy special effects, but its many outtake scenes and  commentary add depth to the characters. Viewing the extra scenes lends a  greater appreciation for the real life Brockovich's determination,  Roberts's delivery (alternately understated and explosive), and director  Soderberg's commentary on editing choices. The supplemental features in the  DVD version are more valuable than many other titles' self congratulatory  "behind the scenes" documentaries.
