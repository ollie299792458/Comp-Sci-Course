During times of war, the size of armies grow; promotions come fast, especially for the career soldier.  When the Civil War ended, the recruits went marching home; unfortunately for the career soldiers, the United States Army no longer needed so many high ranking officers; through no fault of their own, they faced humiliating loss of status and demotion. . . .

If you are Lieutenant Colonel Thursday, your resentment, of what has happened to you, lies with you in every living moment; you had soared to the rank of General during the War, you wore your glory-soaked stars with pride, but now, after all you have done, you've been ordered to take command of a remote outpost in the Arizonan territories to settle some piddling Apache uprising!  The only thing that alleviates your bitterness is your sweet daughter Philadelphia. . . .

If you are Philadelphia, you are happy that you finally get to spend time with your father; you are not bothered in the least about the move to Fort Apache, especially after you catch sight of the shirtless 2nd Lt. O'Roark; from now on there will be two men in your life.  On the night, when you and your father arrive at the post, your father barges in on a regimental celebration; he seeks Captain York. . . .

If you are Captain York, you were - until that moment - the acting commander.  You recognized Thursday from the war: a man with no humor, a martinet, a man who never admits mistakes, a man so certain of himself that he feels no need to listen: to you, to other competent men in the regiment, and - most tragically - to Cochise. . . .
