i really don't know what so many people are complaining about. this Looney Tunes collection is at it's finest. sure most of the shorts in this set have been released before in the "Golden Collections" however those are DVD 480p presentations. this set is 50 animated shorts on blu-ray in full 1080p. yes i too am a lil upset that most of disc 3 is in standard def but watching the first 2 discs i noticed what a huge difference it is watching these cartoons on DVD and on Blu-ray. a couple of shorts might be on the grainy side but considering how old they are, i think Warner Bros did a fantastic job restoring them. i never pay attention to most people's reviews on here anyway especially when it comes to Looney Tunes. if there's a set i don't have in my collection i'm on it. besides when i started buying these they hadn't shown bugs bunny on t.v. in years and i wanted my nieces to be able to see these timeless classics i grew up watching. of course they are now shown on cartoon network but now that i own them they can be enjoyed hopefully for years to come.
