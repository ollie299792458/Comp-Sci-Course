When  i  first  saw  DAMIEN  OMEN 11  in  1978  ,  i was  quite  impressed.  At  that  time  i  hadnt  seen  the  original  movie  ,  so  DAMIEN  was  an  introduction for  me  into  this  genre  of  movie  .  The  thing  that  got  me  first  was  excellent  cinematography,  which  to  this  day  stands  up  against some  very  highly  regarded  movies  .  Then  , came  everything  else .  The  stand  out  acting by  the  more then  impressive  cast.  The  set  pieces,  such as  the  death  of  the  Lew  Ayres  character .  The  tribute to  Alfred  Hitchcock ,  with  a  combination  of  NORTH  BY NORTHWEST  and  THE BIRDS .  The  scene  where  the  doctor  gets  cut  in  half  by  an  elevator  cable .  Jerry  Goldsmiths  demonic  score  is  next .  Its  a wonder  why  that  wasnt  nominated  for  an  oscar .  And  ofcourse  ,  the  wonderful  direction  by  Don  Taylor  ,  who  acted  with  William  Holden  in STALAG  17 in  1953  .  These  are  just  some  of  the  things  i  can  say  about  such  an  underated  classic  like DAMIEN OMEN 11
