This fabulous remake of the 1968 classic is definitely on the list of my 5 favorite movies of all time. This movie has the ingredients to make a film successful... action and sex. But this movie has more, it is classy,  intelligent and unpredictable. Pierce Brosnan is an ultra-rich business man  who just happens to also be an art thief, for pure fun. When a  multi-million dollar piece of artwork disapears from the Metropoliton  museum of art, Catherine (the beautiful Rene Russo) is called in to  investigate. She works for an insurance company and will collect a  percentage of the value for finding the thief. They both do such an  outstanding job in this film. Pierce gets away from his role of  "Bond" and does well. The on-screen romance and the way they  physically compliment each other is an excellent example of perfect  casting. The movie is non-stop excitment that will challenge you to use  your brain, but is sure to entertain you. Dennis Leary does a great job as  a regular city detective thrown onto this case involving amounts of money  that is unfathomable to him. The finale of this movie is one that you will  not soon forget, it was creative, original, and well planned. I have seen  this movie three times in the theatre and I bought it as soon as it came  out on video. This movie appeals to anyone, it has action but not in a  blood and guts kind of way that turns off many viewers. Even Faye Dunaway,  who starred in the original, makes an appearance. I would also recommend  the movie Entrapment. You won't be upset with this purchase. I can't say  enough about it. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Very rarely do I rate something 5  stars, but this deserves it.
