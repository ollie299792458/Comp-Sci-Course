Let me emphasize that the movies are still classics, and after more than 20 years, I still enjoy popping these in the DVD drive to get that superhero jolt going.  Especially John Williams' soundtrack.  He really made Superman the uplifting character in the movie that he is.  Many times did I tie a blanket around my neck because of this movie when I was a kid!
That being said, I bought this collection because it was at 36.00 (pretty cheap for 4 DVDs) and because I thought that, with such a shiny cover and with the words DVD on it, i'd be treated to a THX, remastered and digitally enhanced version of the old classic.  I was wrong.  As others have written, only the first movie is given a semi-treatment (it looks BARELY above VHS) and the other three look like a VHS that you've owned for a LONG TIME (even with popping black dots and hairs, like in the old movies!).  For a DVD, that's not acceptable.  I'm disappointed Warner Brothers!
The music on the first is nicely done (if not the best ever digital treatment), but the other three are VHS quality (although that's harder to tell).
But most importantly, I couldn't watch the movies without thinking to myself, "Wow, this DVD is not what I thought it would be".  A customer shouldn't feel this way.  He should feel happy with the product, and with other classics like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and new classics like the Lord of the Rings out there in amazing THX sound and digital enhancement, this DVD collection falls short of the standard for the DVD medium.
If you don't have the movies and love them, get the collection.  The movies are still worth it.  But if you got VHS copies, skip this.  Wait until Warner Brothers does the job RIGHT.
