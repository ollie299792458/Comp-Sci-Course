First of all, I would like to say that all the people reviewing the movie on how Cameron Diaz looks and how long it is, are retarded. How do you rate a movie based on its length? How does that affect the acting and the intense screenplay and perfectly written script. Despite the length, I have watched this movie nearly 20 times and not once did I have a second thought on how much I loved it. The plot is a prefect example of the struggles that the modern day NFL goes through. Jamie Foxx, LL Cool J, James Woods, Cameron Diaz, and the legendary Al Pacino all star in this movie and do an excellent job. I think Oliver Stone is one of the best Directors/Producers out there, I mean first Scarface now this? I can't wait to see what's next! 
The football Scenes in this movie are breathtaking. It's damn crazy when you see how far into the play they really go. Watch the movie and you will see what Im talking about. Just watch how real these hits are. It's 100% real.
In general, with the huge cast of stars, the great filming style, and the feeling you get of being inside the plays after watching one of the awesome games, this movie gets a 5 stars. In fact I give it 6. And to add on to that, the special features in this film are awesome. Buy this DVD, you will not regret it, no matter how long the movie is.
