Wow...I wasn't too keen on watching this film based on its premise, but it is truly one of the best films I've ever seen. Not many films would dare to peer into the cancer that is white supremacy, yet show that there can be a  redemption of sorts. The most thought-provoking scenes occur during Derek's  (Edward Norton) transformation in prison. Here, he finds that everything is  not as he thought it was, and that some injustices are very real. He  eventually befriends a black inmate who unconditionally treats him as an  equal (despite clearly knowing Derek's racist views), and soon learns that  his friend is serving 6 years for a mere theft that has been trumped up to  "assault of a police officer", while his own sentence for  murdering two black men is lesser. And yet this does not come off as some  preachy statement on the injustices faced by blacks who commit crimes  versus whites. The film levels the playing field quite admirably. Avery  Brooks does a fine job as the Sweeney, a black teacher who recognizes the  blind hatred in Derek and consequently in his younger brother Daniel  (Edward Furlong), who is swiftly following in his brothers footsteps.  Sweeney, reflecting on his own youth, sheds light on reverse-racism in  growing up black. Both Edwards (Norton and Furlong) deliver intensely real  performances.
This film, like no other I have seen in recent years, so  well conveys the concept that the only real enemy is not to be found in  another person, but in the blind, untempered hatred within us fueled by our  fears, insecurities and misunderstandings.
