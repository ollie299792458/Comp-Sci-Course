Fast action and non stop drama takes a viewer inside the haunting hauls of an old Prison and a former life spent there.  Sean Connery plays a man who the Government wanted to forget...in this fictional setting he is deemed as the only man to have escaped from Alcatraz.  Now a group of angry serviceman, distraught over the treatment of men left behind on special ops missions, has hatched a plan to launch biological weapons from the newly acquired prison and attack the Bay area.  Ed Harris plays the leader of this rogue group and the only thing the U.S. government can do to stop it is to get back into the prison...somehow, someway and with a lot of help from the top bio-chemist named Stanley Goodspeed, who is played by Nicolas Cage.

Exciting military style thriller with lots of action and many heart stopping moments, The Rock is great and should perhaps be deemed a classic when compared to other action movies of this kind.  It never seems unrealistic and With Connery, Harris and Cage it has a great cast.
