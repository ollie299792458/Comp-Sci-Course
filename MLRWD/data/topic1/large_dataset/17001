The back of the movie described it as a tale of "passion, intrigue, and betrayal", though I was the one who felt betrayed. I was highly bored throughout the whole movie:
A lot happens in this movie.  It just all happens very....oddly.  There is very little dialouge. Scenes shift from people singing on stage to people staring at each silently to wandering around.  Every time you expect some type of drama or excitement, the scene changes.  
While the movie progresses, we see different lives: Russian jews, roaming gypies, the opera. We really don't get any sort of feel for their lives though. We see five minutes of each, usually little understand since it's in a foreign language.
There doesn't seem to be any real emotion in the movie. Susie's village is burned, the Germans march through Paris...but no one really seems to care!  We get one emotional scene between Ricci and Depp, but even then it's not expressed well.  
This movie alternated between putting me to sleep and making me swear at the randomness of the scene transitions. It's not a good romance, not a good drama, it's just nothing. A hour and 40 minute bore.
