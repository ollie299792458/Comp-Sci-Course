In 1979 I was in junior high and TV miniseries were still actual events on television.  When Salem's Lot aired, we recorded it on a new invention called a VHS Recorder (that's a VCR folks).  The movie scared the bejeezus out of me.  I must have watched it on tape over and over without losing the creep factor.  This DVD features pretty much the entire movie.  Beware of an earlier release that contains a watered down, editted to pieces 2 hour version.
After seeing the film I read the book cover to cover and the film takes only slight liberties with the source material.  In the book, Barlow, the main vampire, has hair and speaks, but he doesn't ramble just to hear himself talk like in the new 2004 TNT television version with Rutger Hauer as Barlow.  Reggie Nalder in the 1979 version is just plain scary.  Freakish fangs, long claws, blue skin, and the nastiest contact lenses you have ever seen.
ALL of the vampires in the original version are fantastic!  They are MONSTERS.  Those Glick kids give me fits even now, 25 years later!  Don't open the window!
David Soul is a bit of a sap masquerading as a hunk.  But Bonnie Bedelia (Die Hard, Presumed Innocent)was good looking back then and was both sexy and believable as the love interest.  Her scene at the end of the film with Soul is scary and heartbreaking.
The rest of the cast is a who's who of character actors, all of whom do a great job.  You'll see a lot of familiar faces in the movie.  A special nod to the late James Mason for an amazing performance.  
Watch the 2004 "re-invention" of Salem's Lot if you must, but if you want the true feeling and fear factor of the book, come see the 1979 version.  It loses a star only because of the limitations of 1979 television censors.  They had all the tools but the limitations of television kept this from being THE definative vampire film of the 1970's.
