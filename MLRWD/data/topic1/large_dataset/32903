There are some standout reasons to own this DVD:
- Smooth Criminal - The original version (from Moonwalker), not the horrible blurry remix video
- 1995 MTV VMA performance.  Amazing Dangerous choreography. Great medley.
- Billie Jean - Motown 25 performance - totally classic MJ moment in history.
- Videos from History hits like They don't really care about us, Scream, SiM, Earth Song
-$8.99? what a bargain for some of the greatest music videos of all time

Thriller and Beat It are amazing as always, but they were also on History - Video Greatest Hits (Vol. 1), so not sure they needed to be repeated here, when they could have added Leave me Alone or The Super Bowl performance to make it a better collection that goes together.  I would say this DVD would rule out needing the Vol 1. except Vol. 1 has the full versions of Bad, Remember the Time, B&W, and The Way you make me Feel, which makes it totally worth getting as well.  The two together make almost a complete collection.  I also highly recommend getting live in bucharest.  What would I love to see released?  One DVD with all the videos that were short films in their full lengths, the ones on these two dvds with Ghosts and You Rock my World added :)

One caveat, I find it really annoying that you have to flip the disc over 1/2 way through.  With a run time of 106 minutes there is no reason on earth it can't all be on one side.  That's probably my main reason for taking away a star.  However, I do think this is absolutely worth getting as Michael Jackson was a music video and performance genius!
