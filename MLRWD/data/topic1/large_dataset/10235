This 2010 special edition radically changes the music and edits lines.  It is probably more elegant and honors the original better, and it is nice to hear Hisashi's other compositions and the ambient noises.  But it feels all wrong.

Since our family has always found this to be a perfect movie as is, and bought a replacement for the better sound when the other died from too much love, it really threw us off to expect lines from the same voices that didn't happen, when the music is already altered and changes the pacing.  It changes the visceral experience and comfort we depended on.

I would have really appreciated an official warning. A small hint, or the word "streamlined" in the official description or on the sticker boasting remastered.  When I buy something I know very well I don't usually read every personal review to check it.  I know the old Jiji interpretation may have been too much for some people, but our family always enjoyed every bit of Phil Hartman in it.  Let us know when you make such improvements - like when something says director's cut we know there will be alterations.  Sure, sometimes they are better, but we sometimes we like our movies just as we expect them, flaws and all.  Or put the older version on there too.
