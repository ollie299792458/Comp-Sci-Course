Because Manohla Dargis, critic for the NYT, raved about this, I was anticipating a much more engrosssing film than what Blind Shaft actually delivers. Though well cast, acted and made with an eye for realistic detail, Blind Shaft lacks the tautness, economy and rhythm that would give the story the urgency it requires. Part of the problem is the editing which, contrary to other opinions delivered here, I found tedious and wasteful. For example, far too much footage is given over to endless shots of the principal characters traversing the barren terrain of the mine camps they work in or loitering in city streets. How many times do we need to watch characters merely move from point A to point B in a frame? There's a quotidian "watching the chicken cross the road" element here, leaving the viewer impatiently wondering if the filmmaker will come to the point. Though the film is only 89 minutes, much of this excess footage seems like padding, perhaps because there really isn't enough material to sustain a full length film. Yes, it is worth watching, and the story has distinct intrigue, but the tension is needlessly diluted with an unfocused edit.
