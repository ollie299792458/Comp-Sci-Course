Tom Clancy knows how to make vivid and realistic stories, because he walked in the halls of power and really understands about politics, the military and secret services. "The sum of all fears" is no exception, and shows how a determined partie with the right connections can begin a series of events that leads to a war with dire consequences. This film, although changing lots of plot, character and faction elements, keeps the main substance of the novel: Fear will tear us apart.

Especially in europe we believe that we live in a state of grace and permanent peace, but it's so fragile that we must cherish it. This film and novel is really a cautionary tale.

This Jack Ryan is a freshman in the CIA, not the hardened sub-director we're used to, and Ben Affleck fulfills the role quite well. Morgan Freeman is great as a top CIA executive; charismatic and with great leadership characteristics, easy stuff for such a good actor.

Secondary roles like the russian president and the american operative are also well played, leaving their mark.

The story itself as some "reality checks", like the secret services almost omnipotence, a walk in post nuclear bomb Baltimore, total discardance of nuclear Electro Magnetic Pulse (although the commentaries of Tom Clancy state that a small weapon probably would not knock out the entire network of com nods) or the fist fight with the big nazi (why????).

Good entertainment with a message. Common sense and wisdom must always be present in politics, especially when we have weapons that can destroy us all.

The extras in the DVD are quite good; explaining how was done the main scenes that required most special fx (like the effects of the explosion, or the A4 being shotdown); there are also interviews with the actors, and great commentaries from Tom Clancy (don't forget to watch this film a second time with the commentaries on - they should have hired Mr.ยบ clancy as an adviser...the film would be better). Three stars for the extras.
