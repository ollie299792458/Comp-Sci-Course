Hard Boiled is every action fans dream come true. Quite possibly the greatest action film of past years,it encompasses everything that an action film should be. Chow Yun Fat gives a brilliant performance as the vengeful yet charismatic cop who lets nothing stand in the way of his own personal (and yet justified?) revenge on the criminal world of the Triad. Jam-packed with tons o' gun fights and people getting cut down to bloody ribbons,the movie has some of the most extreme action sequences you are likely to see and is extremely well-paced. While most fans will suggest the hospital shoot-out finale as the milestone of the movie,I myself found the opening tea house shoot-out equally as entertaining and mesmerizing (though I do  also admire the finale). One can't help but be almost hypnotized by the brutal yet beautifully filmed cinematography of John Woo's films,as he is a truly visionary film-maker and one of a kind. Hard Boiled is a classic that should be in every action fans film library. And if this film isn't in your collection,do yourself a favor and buy it. Don't even rent it. Just buy it. You will not be disappointed,and if you are,I question your definition of "action."
