This set is getting bad reviews, based on a few people who really don't know what they're talking about. One of the reviews gave the blu ray a one-star review because this set isn't available on DVD. How does that make sense? Some other reviews, bashed the fact that these aren't the "extended" versions. Of course there not, you can already buy those. The point of this set is recreate the entire theatrical experience, so of course they have the theatrical cuts of the film and in my opinion, this is the way these films were meant to be seen. Also keep in mind that most of those bad reviews, came out before this edition did, therefore they aren't first hand reviews and are inaccurate.
I received the set today and it's great, packaging is great incredibly detailed and really adds to the feel of the fims. The movies play just as they did in theaters, which to me is the best way to see them and it is packed with special features, a good amount of them exclusive to this set. If you liked the Grindhouse films, but didn't get to see them in theaters, or if your like me and wanted to recreate that experience, then I highly recommend this set. If you want the extended cuts, well then go buy those.
