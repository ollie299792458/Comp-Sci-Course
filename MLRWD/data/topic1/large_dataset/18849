I dearly love Sarah Michelle Gellar and Joey Lauren Adams.  The whole reason I bought this movie in a $5.99 bargain bin was because of the two of them.  And neither nor both of them was enough to save this film for me.

This movie jumps and bounces all over the place.  The basketball player is cheating on the mafia girl with his professor.  The professor is cheating on the basketball player with a couple of swingers.  The chemistry student made up LSD "according to the original formula" and the basketball player carried it on a plane and no drug dogs caught him?  And a Harvard student is stupid enough to take five doses when he's been warned only to take one?

And as if the previous part of the movie wasn't bad enough... then we get to watch the rest of the movie through the funhouse mirror of an LSD trip, the swingers coincidentally turn out to be FBI agents investigating the mafia girl's dad, the deal with the dad turns out to be a sham... what the HECK?

Sorry but this movie stinks.  Like I said above, I only paid $5.99 in a bargain bin for it and I feel like I got ripped off.
