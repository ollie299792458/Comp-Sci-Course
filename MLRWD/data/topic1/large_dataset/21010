Let me start by saying that this movie was not at all what I expected.  I expected a 1950's sci-fi cheesefest that I could laugh at by its own accidental comedic relief.
  What I got was a very well done spoof of 1950's sci-fi cheesefest. The humor was subtle and matched the 1950's style of dialog and "action" (there really wasn't any)The humor is sprinkled throughout the film. In fact there was rarely a moment when I was wasn't laughing or at the very least amused.
  There were quite a few laugh out loud moments ("Slowly!") and some great DUH! moments. The "plot" made about as much sense as the movies they were mocking which is part of the movie's charm. They even used some of the same film techniques used by the B-movie makers, (repeatedly used scenery, mismatched quotes and out of place laughter).
  If you are like me and love old, cheeseie sci-fi, you will enjoy this  solid comedy. As an added bonus, you can watch it with the kids as there is  nothing inappropriate, no swears, nudity or even sexual references.  Yes, it is possible to be funny without being vulgar. Amazing!
  This is the 2nd installment in the Lost Skeleton series (I found out after watching it) so you might want to pick up The Lost Skeleton Of Cadavra first...unlike me... who, it seems, must do things backwards.
  Either way, enjoy this film! Its a keeper!
