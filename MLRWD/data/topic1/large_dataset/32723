WOW! Finally! I almost made the mistake of purchasing the overly priced VHS version years early, but I felt the cost was a bit too high for me. I waited and I added my vote that this epic mini series be available for DVD. I am so glad it is finally here. After some difficulties, I finally recieved my copy and I spent two whole days re-living my fascination with North and South.

Book 1 and Book 2 are excellent. The coiling of lives between the Hazards and Mains is just wonderful to watch and after it's done you are left with a sad but happy feeling. As a Poli Sci major, it's easy to see the parallel's between two distinct civilizations existing in the same country.

I won't give you an overview of each episode. You can read a whole bunch of other reviews for that. I am just here to say this is great purchase for you and the whole family. It's like a history lesson that adds all the fillers to make it interesting. It also has a wonderful message and can be watched again and again. I am planning on a holiday routine with my family that will include this epic mini-series. Though...be warned. Just stick with Book 1 and Book 2. Book 3 is a dismal failure. I remember when this series aired on TV that I hated it. This feeling was still prevalent when I watched it on DVD again. I just couldn't get through it. The huge departure from the first two books is too much to deal with. The writers of this series would have been better servied if they took creative license with the source material.

Aside from Heaven and Hell, Book 3, take time to enjoy North and South. You will LOVE IT!!!

Update for 2012:

Please make this available in Blu-ray. I recently rewatched this again on my HD Blu-ray player and realized it's still totally awesome. My Blu-ray did the necessary up grade but true HD will just make this all the more better.
