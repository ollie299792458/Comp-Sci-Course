I was very interested in watching this movie, since it is set at a time and place that is very intimately connected with me.  My own  parents could well have been among the characters in it.  It is set in 1920-1922 in West Cork, around Ballingeary, not so far from my mother's home.  Indeed, my parents played their own roles in these events, my father in the IRA and my mother as a messenger (just like the several children that appear throughout).

The early scenes of the movie, of the casual and brutal violence of the Black and Tans, were for me the visualization of stories I have heard from my childhood.  People I knew in my youthful visits to Ireland were among the victims.  But it is hard for someone born in the US to really grasp how terrifying it must have been.  This movie certainly does it well.

It also does a good job of cataloging the ways in which kindly disposed young men could be driven to become guerrilla fighters who, in their turn, became efficient killers.

I think the movie is better in presenting the early part of the story.  It breaks down somewhat in dealing with the Treaty and the Civil War.  Although the Civil War forms the final emotional climax of the film, the steps leading up to that final tragedy are set out fairly pedantically, in the context of an extended argumentative meeting and a church service.  It felt lacking in the bitter passions that actually drove it.  I'm afraid that this terrible divide, which cast a pall on the country for decades, needed a bit better handling to introduce it to people not already familiar with the issues.

That said, it was interesting for me to see a well done film of the world my parents grew up in and of the dilemmas faced by so many in it.
