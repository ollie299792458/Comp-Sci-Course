I have read several of the reviews of this film, and I have trouble seeing how anyone can give this masterpiece less than 4 stars. It is really a great piece of work.

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale both put on top notch performances as obsessed and highly talented magicians. Michael Cane is superb as the magical-engineer. The rest of the cast is perfectly placed, and wonderfully directed.

The story is complex. Perhaps one of the most complex plots I have encountered in a while, and this was refreshing. Far too many overly simplistic, dumbed-down plots have been prevalent in cinema for quite some time. Seeing a good story that requires that you pay close attention to make sure you do not miss some subtle element made this film even more engaging that it already is.

The only flaw, if it can be called that, is in the characterizations. Niether of the protagonist magicians is really all that likable. Jackman's character is a showman, and an egotist' Bale's character is a compulsive liar and a man seemingly only at peace when others are not. Still, at various points in the story you see a softer side of each character (but never at the same time). This means that you find yourself hoping for victory in one character, then the next -- thus, I doubt this is a true flaw more than it is a cinematic device.

The very end pay-off (or reveal, depending on your perspective) is the only reveal in the film that is telegraphed. The *fact* of this plot twist is known far too soon, and far too 'matter-of-factly' to be a true shocker. But that point asside, all of the other smaller reveals that are taking place at the same time are enough to keep you at the edge of your seat though it all.

The DVD claims you will want to watch it again immediately after you see it. It is correct. I did... and do... want to see it again. I will watch it a few more times, I am sure, before I move on to another film.
