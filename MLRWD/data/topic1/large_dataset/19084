This is in no way a boxing movie, but rather boxing is really a metaphor for any of our life's battles, whether it's overcoming life's obstacles, career or relationship wise.

Maggie represents the type of individual who would not take no for an answer. Faced with discrimination, family problems, she was determined to overcome them and become a great boxer.

Frank has issues of his own, namely in his past, past regrets, past doubts, past this and past that. We are offered glimpses of some of his regrets but not all, but we're given enough to know that he lives in a state of doubt, always getting close, but never quite make it.

Freeman's character is really a centre between the two extremes, one that wants to go get it, and the other more conservative approach.

So what was this movie about? To me, it's about living your life to it's fullest, and when it's time, it's time, and you know that you had a great ride. Many of us live a life of mediocrity, never striving for what we dream of, and am stuck in that cycle of averageness. Maggie shows us her dreams, and despite obtstacles that would overwhelm most of us, she battled on and "had a great ride".

There's an old saying, "you should live your life knowing that you've sailed, rather than never having sailed at all."
