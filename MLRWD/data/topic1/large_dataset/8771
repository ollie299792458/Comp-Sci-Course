This is a great set, the only annoyance is that you have to sit through Leonard Maltin's justifications for Disney cartoons such as the classic "Der Fuehrer's Face". The morons in Disney's political correctness department who made the decision to put this droning, banal nonsense in front of each cartoon and to set up the DVD so you *CAN'T* fast forward through it should be beaten. So in order to watch "Der Fuehrer's Face" or "Education for Death" you have to listen to Maltin tell you that "Gee, during World War II we were in a war and goshdarnit, people were just less sensitive back then and ethnically stereotyped people, especially their enemies", which aside from insulting your intelligence is obnoxious and faintly nauseating.
Other than the nauseating dose of political correctness the set is fantastic, Disney really does a good job in taking care of the film stock of their older cartoons, colors on the DVD are vivid and clear and there aren't any scratches on the transfer. Sound is clear, although sometimes it's hard to tell as who can understand Donald Duck?
If you're buying this for kids you might want to watch out, depending upon how able your kids are to handle adult themes, aside from the content of the propaganda features there's also a hilarious scene where Donald thinks that he's lost his legs and is shown putting a pistol to his head to end it all, which some kids, raised on blander fare such as "The Little Mermaid" might have difficulty dealing with.
