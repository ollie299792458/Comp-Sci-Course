Leila is a tragedy.  In other words, we sense from the onset where this film is going.  And there is nothing at all that will change the outcome -- it is destiny.  So why wonder why Reza can't call a stop or how his mother could be so cruel?  Leila has the answer: it is her fate to be have endless patience; it was written on her forehead from her birth.
Apart from the virtues of the story, I liked the way this movie shows how powerful women are within Iranian culture.  For starters, it is obvious that although Leila's family is well-off, Reza's family is quite wealthy -- such a marriage, to the economic benefit of the woman, would never happen in a culture which doesn't value women.  Also, all the mothers and sisters we see are very opinionated and vocal.  And second marriages are permitted because of the clarity of Muslim mandates on the matter -- the Prophet himself had multiple wives; nevertheless, it is obvious that the Iranian Cosmopolites frown on the practice.  And it may even explain some of this movie if you understand Islamic chain of command: first one must obey God, then one obeys God's messenger, and then one obeys one's mother.
The respect and love between Reza and Leila is touching and beautiful.  They laugh and poke fun at people and make kebab together on their patio, and seem so perfectly united, which makes the foreshadowing even more poignant.
But it is Leila's nature that is the most fascinating part of this movie.  Her humility and warmth when she receives gifts for her birthday, her forebearance with her mother-in-law, her anxiety as she scrubs down her house -- all of it is so real and so tragic.
