It has a comedy sticker on the box but even if it had some funny moments, I felt it was more a drama. I felt that Dave Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is kind of a loser. Basically a good man who wants to do the right thing. But he compares himself with his larger-than-life father. An award winning writer. Cage's character is an average man. Someone who if he didn't grow up in a upper-middle class home more than likely wouldn't have even become The Weather Man. He's not even a meteorologist. He's more of an personality.  It seems the local weatherman is about being likable and good with kids judging from what I see on the news.

At first, I didn't like Nicolas character. He's making $240,000 a year just working a few hours a day! Then you realize he has to put up with a lot of crap. People wanting his autograph (I think he's puzzled by that). Having food thrown at him (junk food like Big Gulps and McDonald's hot apple pie). Having to make appearances at odd events and appear to be happy no matter how he feels.

Yet he wants to be a good father. His daughter is made fun of at school and called a cruel nickname because of her weight and clothes she wears. Dave could have handled the matter better.

What concerns me a little is about the young lady who played this part. I hope she is secure enough in herself that she handled some taunting she might experienced from her peers. We may be a fat society but overweight children still gets teased unmercifully.
