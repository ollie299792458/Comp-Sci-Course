This 1963 film from 20th Century Fox, albeit oboviously compressed in time, offers a great opportunity for insight into the classic struggle of Rome's movement from a Republic to rule by dictatorship. Subtle references such as Cleopatra's teasing of Caesar's balding by referencing  his cognomen (nickname) "Julius" (means full head of hair), the burning of the great library of Alexandria, and the propaganda used by rullers of the time (Cleopatra claiming to be Isis and Caesar claiming to be related to Venus through Aeneas), give opportunity for scholarship; all the while being thoroughly entertained. Scenes like the death of Pompey, the mention of Caesar's pride, his 10th Legion, Cleopatra's references to Caesar's writings "Commentarii", Cleopatra's grand entrance into Rome with her son, Caesarian, the naval battle at Actium between Antony and Octavian, are all rich with generally accurate historical facts. The Latin word for school and fun are the same..."ludus, -i". This cinema offers both.
