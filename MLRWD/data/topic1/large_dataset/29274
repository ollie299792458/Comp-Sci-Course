No.  This wasn't the best film I've ever seen, but it was pretty good.  It kept me interested from start to finish and that is more than I can say for several other films that are portrayed as "a masterpiece".  Many time during the movie I would find myself thinking..."Boy, I would hate to run into him."  Cause the sad reality is, there are people walking amongst us every day that have sick and twisted personalities that do things for reasons that make since to no one other than themselves and feel justified in doing so.  If you don't get the ending, go back and watch it again.  Contrary to what many have said, there is an ending to this film.  Maybe not one you agree with or appreciate, but an ending all the same.  The Drug deal went wrong, but there were two sides to the deal...Chigurh's side and the side of the Mexicans (Who were seen fleeing the scene of the crime at the end).  Pretty lucrative deal for them all around...they returned for their product earlier on and ended up with the loot to boot!!
