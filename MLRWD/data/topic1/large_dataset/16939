Brando's ambivalence about this project - He reportedly wanted to do a film about Caryl Chessman the recently executed,convicted killer who had been 'rehabilitated' instead - is apparent throughout. He strove to make this a chronicle of man's inhumanity to man and wanted to explore what happened on Pitcairn Island in more detail than previous versions in light of the tragedy which unfolded there. The ending that was finally filmed a year after everything else - notice what appears to be a hair-piece on his head - didn't really satisfy anybody. All the while,his excentric playing seemed to Pauline Kael among others to be distracting - a stunt. Brando the erstwhile uncouth slob is playing a Restoration fop with an all British supporting cast.
He could have made 'Lawrence of Arabia' instead, but didn't want to spend two years on a camel in the desert.  How many guys would when they can spend time in Tahiti? What really sticks in my mind about this film is Brando's performance, especially the accent. In fact, it's my favourite English accent in any film! While watching 'Master and Commander' I couldn't help but wonder how funny it would be if Russell Crowe had to play opposite an even bigger American star who insisted on employing an accent like Brando's. I can imagine the tension on the set!
