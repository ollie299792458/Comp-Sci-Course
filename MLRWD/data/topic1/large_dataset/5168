Steven Seagal's performance proves to be the only worthwhileaspect of THE GLIMMER MAN.  His soft-spoken, John Wayne style actingcommands attention throughout the film.  Seagal's even funny at times, just as the Duke could be in, for example,THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE and THE SEARCHERS.  
Unfortunately, the rest of THE GLIMMER MAN falls flat, as if it were on the receiving end of Steven Seagal's fist.  The worst parts are what ought to be the best parts - the action sequences.  Multiple blows to the head and groin barely affect people.  An explosion throws a man out a second story window and, because he lands in an open convertible, he's OK!  Even in a karate flick, don't you want at least some credibility?
While the video's cover promises wisecracks from GLIMMER MAN co-star Keenan Ivory Wayans, instead THE GLIMMER MAN uses Wayans as little more than a prop for what is an all-Seagal vehicle.
Finally, THE GLIMMER MAN features several homosexual characters as psycho-killers and criminals.  If Hollywood is so liberal, how come they are still perpetuating such a stereotype?
I mentioned that Steven Seagal's sometimes funny in this movie, just as he was in his great UNDER SIEGE films.  I'd like to see him try a real comedy...
