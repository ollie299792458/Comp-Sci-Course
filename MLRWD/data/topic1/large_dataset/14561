"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace" is a laughably bad entry in the otherwise ok Superman series.  The premise is well-meaning: Superman (Christopher Reeve) makes an attempt to rid the world of nuclear weapons.  Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) decides to take advantage of this by becoming a black market nuclear weapons dealer.  He also creates Nuclear Man, a supervillain who gets his power from the sun, to kill Superman.  Chaos and unbelievably bad special effects ensue.  The DVD transfer is crisp, but perhaps too crisp:  during one segment, which takes place on the moon, you can see the cables attached to Superman's belt, as well as the black curtains in the background which are supposed to be deep space.  The original "Superman" from ten years earlier had far superior special effects.  In fact, the old black and white TV series did better.  At least they knew their limitations.  A complete misfire from beginning to end.  The disc has almost no special features, but then, why would it?
