the terminator is absolutely one of the best movies arnold schwarzenegger made in his career. it is about a terminator disguised as a man (arnold schwarzenegger) who goes back in time to kill sarah connor, who will give birth to a baby that will eventually become the leader of a resistance in the future against the machines. i have only seen this one out of the trilogy. the terminator is a great film. it has a great plot, quotable lines, good acting, and, most important of all, great action. my biggest complaint was that the terminator effects were pretty bad. but oh well, it is quite impressive since this movie is from 1984 and was low budget. this is truly a great start for a series im sure will be awesome. this movie is quite impressive since it is a pretty smart flick, especially for an arnold schwarzenegger movie. so overall, i give the movie 4 1/2 stars and the dvd release 1/2 a star, since is has a good menu, a theatrical trailer i have never seen on youtube, and a lenticular, or 3-d cover, im not sure. this is not the version to get. there is a special edition here on youtube that you can get pretty cheap. i got this dvd from costco in a bundle that had this and robocop, for only 10 dollars.
