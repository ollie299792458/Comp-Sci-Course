'The Cure', from 1995, was Joseph Mazzello's next major non TV role after 'The River Wild'.  Brad Renfro also features in this his second major role, the first one of which was 'The Client'.
These days of course both actors are now in their 20s so this is the young Joe Mazzello and young Brad Renfro we're discussing :)  The Cure is one of Joseph Mazzello's finest roles along with his performance in Jurassic Park but of course everybody does a superb job with this film.  
There are no fancy visual effects or major stunts in this film, just a simple straight story of two boys, Dexter, who has AIDS, and Erik.  They befriend each other through the garden fence and "hang out" a lot.  Erik takes advantage of Dexter initially but the pair bond well on screen (even though Joseph and Brad didn't get along together off-screen).  They eventually decide to travel to New Orleans after reading a tabloid article about a doctor who claims to have found a cure for AIDS.  They meet colourful characters on the way but never reach New Orleans, instead Dexter's health takes a turn for the worse forcing Erik to take him back home.  Sadly, Dexter dies from his illness but it opens up some really heartfelt scenes towards the movie's end which make the previous 90mins or so very heartwarming.
A very well recommended film that is not just worthy of rental; it's worthy of a place in your video collection.  Joe &amp; Brad both carry the film very well, Joseph Mazzello was, and still is, a very natural actor even at this young age.  If you never rent/import anything else ever, do it for this movie, an all-time underrated classic movie.  I've only had it three weeks and I've watched it four times already :)  Rating:  5 out of 5.
