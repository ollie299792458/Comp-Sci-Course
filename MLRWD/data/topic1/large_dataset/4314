This movie is a perfect example of why I can't stand movie critics, especially Maltin.  The guy wouldn't know a good movie if one fell out of the sky and nailed him in the head.  Just 'cause he doesn't "get" a film, it instantly gets relegated to the realm of crap.  That's sad.  Particularly because Maltin consistantly dogs good films and praises junk, and especially because Turtles I is a damn good film!  It ain't Gone With the Wind by any means, but it's a fine family film with all the elements (action, drama, fine humor, and even a moral).  My favorite reason for endorsing this film?  It's EVERYTHING the '89 Keaton Batman film SHOULD have been...and WASN'T.  Every so often you hear comic books fans throw around the names of "The Great Comic Book Adaptions"  (meaning films adapted from comic books).  You always hear Superman (deservedly so), Batman (ugh!  I don't care what anybody says, they all sucked.  "Mask of the Phantasm" was the ONLY great Batman film!), and X-Men.  But right up there in the top 5 or so should be TMNT.  Except for their ties to Marvel Comics' Daredevil (the Turtles were created as a parody of DD's origin), the movie follows the comics amazingly close and accurate without being "comic-booky" like the god-awful "Batman and Robin".
