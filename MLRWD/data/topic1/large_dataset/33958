My little granddaughter became very interested in the music of the Laurie Berkner Band while "watching" Jacks Big Music Show. Then after finding that she has cds and a dvd, I have bought all but one. Am ordering the Rocketship cd today. I also have to order another of the dvd, as it is traveling from one house to another. I am sure the first one is going to be worn out. Now my granddaughter is 2, and she pulls my hands to dance with I'm gonna catch you, and we are the dinosaurs . She wants to play "the show" at least a couple times a day.We all know what "the show " is ! Now I have to buy her little friend of the same age one for her birthday, as her Daddy saw how interested she and her 3 year brother were when we played "the show" at my granddaughters 2nd birthday party. The kids hardly blinked ! This is a gift that keeps on giving. Gives the parents and grandparents some cardio exercise, and new songs to sing !
I just hope that Laurie makes a new DVD, and soon ! The cds are great for in the car entertainment too. Can't say enough good things about this music ! Gets the kids interested in sounds, music and active play !
