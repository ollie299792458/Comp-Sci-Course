I also want to add my voice to the choir of people being happy to see this very good comedy show being finally released on DVD. I kinda lost hope and was elated to see this on an add inside another DVD box. Needless to say it took me all of 3 min to go on line and order my copy. I discovered this show by sheer luck as it was shown late at night due to adult content on the Swiss French TV channel (I live in Switzerland). It was in the original language (good) but with subtitles in French (bad as they covered the image and distracted from the view). I was immediately captivated as I found it really funny to hilarious especially some of the B&W movie "thoughts". I did manage to tape them all and also copy them to other tapes to have them in chronological order. I still have the dusty tapes somewhere but soon to go as now we have the luxury of having this great show on DVD. So hello freeze frame, subtitles if and when you want, instant replay etc...

The DVD are actually good maybe the image a little bit grainy at times but what the heck is an old show and is only small trade off.

Now let's only hope that the other seasons will be also quickly published on DVD!
