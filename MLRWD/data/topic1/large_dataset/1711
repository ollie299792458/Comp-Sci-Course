I've watched several of the DC animated features, but there have been two to date that adapted stories that I held near and dear in my younger days.  The first -- the Death and Return of Superman -- was a huge departure from the original story, and while I understood the logic behind those changes, I found that movie to be a huge disappointment.

This one, however, gets much more right than wrong.  I've read the source material hundreds of times, so of course there are some minor scenes here and there that I wanted to see brought to life.  I was also a bit disappointed with they way McKenzie plays Bruce/Batman -- he sounds too robotic, though I think that was done intentionally to try to portray the tortured individual from the book.  Other choices that stuck out mainly did so because they didn't fit what I've always had in my head for a particular character.  For example, I've always imagined that Commissioner Loeb was intended to basically be Gordon Jump from WKRP, and Alex Rocco as the Roman just sounds way off.  But, these are all minor, and I think this is as good of an adaptation as was possible without making a 4+ hour affair that recreates the original comics scene for scene.  I'd probably still enjoy that, though).

I would imagine that a adaptation of Dark Knight Returns is coming down the road, and I'm excited to see how they pull that one off, too.  I also would love to see Year Two made, though I suppose Mask of the Phantasm was already a pretty good version of that one.
