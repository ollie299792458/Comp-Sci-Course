I had heard about this movie my whole life never really paying attention to it until just randomly deciding to pick it up at Amazon since I always had a soft spot for Naval pictures going back to childhood (perhaps that is why I later joined the Navy and did four years active on an amphibious assault troop carrier). I bought the 209 minute version of the film and did not regret it or get bored watching it. It keeps you drawn in the entire time and very importantly it presents a different angle that you typically do not see in war movies anymore and that is it is presented from the side of the enemy (our enemy) which may set  the audience up for a dilemma. How do you empathize with the Nazi sailors? There is actually very little politics in the movie. Most of the focus is on their human survival and how war takes it's toll. You forget who these guys represent.
  Though I served on a ship, I still felt like I was seeing a near mirror image of these submariners experiences in my own. Well heck, when you translate Das Boot it comes out "The Boat". Up until this, I would have said Run Silent, Run Deep was number one over The Hunt for Red October, Crimson Tide, and Ice Station Zebra but if you have to have only one of these, get this one.

Oh yeah, if you don't dig reading subtitles or don't know German, the same actors went back and dubbed their own lines in English which is pretty rare.
