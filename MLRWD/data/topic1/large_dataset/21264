Even though Moonraker did make a profit, the "space" ending to the film left a bad taste in many people's mouths (we needed Graham Chapman to step in here, say "This is silly" and move on to the next bit).  With For Your Eyes Only we see a return to what Bond is at his best.  More than one of the short stories is used here for that purpose (I won't say which in case you have read them and haven't seen the film.  It is a thriller after all).  Roger Moore wasn't sure about a return to the rough nature of the character that was traditional to the books but his performance here is his best in the series.  One sequence (that I will also not ruin for those who haven't seen it) where Bond reminds us about his licence to kill is an icon of the series.  Critics and fans who still don't like Moore as Bond after this film are simply still upset that he's not Sean Connery.  Moore was looked at for the part in the beginning and was liked for it by Ian Fleming himself (he also liked David Niven and Cary Grant).  Connery, of course, did a great job but here we get to see that the authors faith was well deserved.  Critics have also not liked the "anti-climatic" style of the ending but I think that they forget that a good action thriller doesn't need to have everything and everyone blow up at the end.  The end has plenty of action and is, very "Bond".
