I am a huge fan of the Blade series. Blade, was a fantastic movie. Great story, great effects, great acting and kick ass action. Blade II, I rank up there with one of the best comic book movies ever made. It totally embodied what a comic book is. Colorful, graphic, a little cmapy and a little over the top. I think Blade II and X-Men 2 are two of the best comic book movies ever done. So, here comes Blade III......naturally i was excited. Then i heard Ryan Reynolds ( Van Wilder himself) was gonna be in it, i was stoked. I went opening weekend, and man, what a let down. The story was weak, the action generic, and choppy and the acting was pretty bad. The only saving grace was the dry wit of Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds). I don't blame Wesley Snipes suing someone over what a train wreck this film was. I mean the final fight between Blade and Drake, was so f-ing weak. I mean for the head Vampire, i would have thought it would have been a fight scene that rivaled any Jackie Chan or Jet Li film. But, alas, it was not. As a fan of the series, im sure i will buy it on DVD next week, watch it again, and pray i was in a bad mood or something when i saw it the first time, so this time it will seem better. As a person who love movies, and takes a movie for what it is, i have to say Blade 3 was a major let down!!!
