A SPORT OF EMPERORS AND BANDITS ALIKE, PING PONG.

Balls of Fury is a movie directed by Robert Ben Garant, starring Dan Fogler, Christopher Walken, and Maggie Q. In the tradition of such movies as Epic Movie and Scary Movie comes the outrageous comedy Balls of Fury. Balls of Fury focuses the viewer's attention to the underground world of ping pong, where "fortunes are won, and lost". The movie has very simple slapstick comedic taste and will keep the viewer laughing constantly. I personally enjoyed the comedy of the movie, but in truth much of the comedy used in the movie was not original. For example, there are scenes in the movie where FBI Agent Rodriguez (George Lopez) imitates Al Pacino Scarface. Also, it is seen that Rodriguez is an aspiring James Bond 007 sort of agent. Balls of Fury has very few flaws, and no plot holes, and the line-up of actors chosen for this film is simply amazing. I recommend this movie to anybody that enjoys slapstick like humor, and is hoping for a good laugh.
