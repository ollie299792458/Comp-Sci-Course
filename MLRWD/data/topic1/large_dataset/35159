First off,if you're getting this,you've already seen the movies or someone told you to watch them.
If you havent and just want some funny looking DVD case,you wont regret it. Evil Dead is to Horror movies as Bach is to Classical Music. Its something you have to feast on at least once to know if you like it or not.Dont listen to personal views or busted revies on websites...

Its campy,sure.Its not really scary anymore by our standards BUT God-damn is it good ;D The "Chin" Bruce Campbell stars as a simple guy,stuck in a forest cabin surrounded by evil (and low on gas,but thats much later) with his only key to life is a chainsaw,an ol' dual-barrel and a book made of human flesh.So yeah,with a description like that,you know what you're in for.

Now,onto the important part.The DVD has plenty features on its disks,including extra footage not available on other versions of the movie (like the one with the Skull Poster cover,all-black case).The internal "booklet" is faithfully remade like the intro sequence with old,tainted pages and most of the visible pages of the Necronomicon reproduced inside it.The mouth on the soft,cotton-lined cover (YES,the whole case is squishy) has a hidden button in its mouth that -probably- speaks and curses at you...

The reason im using -probably- is because sadly,the copy i got had MELTED batteries in it and i had to find out the hard way that it was the case by having to pretty much rip it open from the inside cover to get to the electrical parts.Its nothing irreplaceable,but its a small detail that hurts a little :(
