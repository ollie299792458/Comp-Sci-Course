Blood came spewing out of my ears and eyes about three minutes into this movie. I'm sorry I don't want to offend anyone but this movie was absolutely embarrasing. Cannot believe this was released theatrically. Ben Affleck is so bad that I wonder if he has any talent at all. He plays this tough guy from Brooklyn, sort of but never fully commits to the accent. But the worst performance is by far by Justin Bartha, who in playing a mentally retarded character seems to be making fun of mentally disabled people instead of being one. A Dustin Hoffman "Rainman" rip off or a Leo Dicaprio "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" impression would have been better than what he does. Also, I can only hope that Al Pacino felt he owed director Martin Brest for getting him the Best Actor Oscar for "Scent of a Woman". Otherwise I cannot imagine why he went near this script. Knowing that there are hundreds of amazing films out there that could have been made instead if this, irritates me to no end. Save yourself the trouble, unless you want to know how good every other movie is and how bad they can actually get.
