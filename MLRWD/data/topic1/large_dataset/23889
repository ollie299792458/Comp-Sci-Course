Maybe "Gamer" is just too close to the truth for comfort, and this is why critics are panning it. After all, true masterpieces are 20 years ahead of the curve. Maybe we'll get it in 2029, about the same time, hopefully, that our houses will be fashioned with special Web screening rooms where we can lie down and people will automatically be able to invade our privacy on humongous video screens.

There's a key scene in the film where Kable has just been declared "fragged" and the general public is left holding its breath, all their hopes and dreams resting on this death row inmate besting the big corporate stooge. And it just drives the point home how we are so obsessed with violence in America that we make idols of our Mansons, our Dahmers and our George W. Bushes. Maybe it is just too hard for most of us to accept the fact that we are bloodthirsty beasts more sympathetic to villains than pesky peacenick, compost-loving heroes. I mean won't spoiled cabbage just deterioriate on its own just fine at the landfill, seeing as it's biodegradable anyway?

"Gamer" ends up being better than "Blade Runner," which was based on a short story by a drug addict who thought God lived in a mainframe on Jupiter; it's better than "Strange Days," written by a Martin Scorsese groupie (if you can get any more sad than that I don't even want to know); and it's way better than "The Matrix," which was nothing more than Zen Buddhist propaganda anyway as a favor to Keanu Reeves, who was still reeling over the fact that Brad Pitt had scored the main role in "Seven Years in Tibet" two years earlier. On top of which, Gerald Butler is a more convincing actor than Russell Crowe any day of the week ... and there is a really cool car chase scene.
