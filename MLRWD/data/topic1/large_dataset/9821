I was born during the Vietnam war years, and have no idea if what Stone depicts in this movie is realistic or not; however, it is my favorite.  There is so much more to this movie than many realize.  The dynamics of the relationships between characters, especially Sgt. Elias and Sgt. Barnes are like taughtly pulled violin strings ready to snap. In fact, they do snap in an extremely dramatic and lethal manner.  The scene where Sgt. Elias is literally running for his life is made even more heart wrenching when coupled with Barber's Adagio for Strings.  This particular piece of music is haunting in it's self; but with the death scene of Sgt. Elias it is emotionally devestating.  This particular piece of music portrays the despair, sorrow, and isolation felt by Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen's character), and probably many men who were truly there.

I will admit, not having been there, not learning much about Vietnam in school (it was a topic quickly glossed over), and having an older brother who was in Vietnam not talk about it, does lend itself to misinformation/misimpressions gathered from films such as this one.  Having said that, what I take away from the movie is the Hell too many men experienced, and how the Vietnam war affected all of us in ways we don't even realize.  Is it real?  I believe many parts of it are not, as a whole, but did those things happen?  Unfortunaley they probably did to some extent.

I watch this movie to remind myself of the atrocities done to man by man, and to remind myself why I honor our service men and women.  With every watching I am humbled and awed by the sacrifices so many men gave.  That is the value of Platoon.
