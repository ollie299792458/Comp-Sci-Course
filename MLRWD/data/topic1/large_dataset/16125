Although Samuel L. Jackson and Juliane Moore give great performances, the plot line of this movie is too muddled to save these two great actors. The movie doesn't work as a police drama if you know anything about professional policing. And the people in the movie don't seem true to type. Julianne Moore is the "saint of the projects" except for the fact that she's abusing her kid, boinking her best friend's husband, lying to the police, and covering up for a manslaughter charge. She supposedly is racially unbiased, but as soon as she needs a fall guy, she creates the "mysterious black guy" and is quite happy to let a neighborhood burn down to cover her tracks. She should have been put in a mental ward under protective custody in the first scene.

  Too many characters spend their time yelling at each other rather than getting their jobs done. Samuel L. Jackson is the good cop but everybody in the movie dumps on him, criticizes how he does his job, or prevents him from doing it. He seems to break every rule in the book in dealing with Moore's character.

  Edie Falco is misused as the head of an organization that tracks down missing children. Doesn't anyone notice that she uses about 90% of the volunteers as decoy while she leads Moore on a separate journey with a completely different agenda? Falco's character makes it seem as anyone driven to find missing children is obsessed and unstable.

  Hey, it's your money. Go to see the lead performances, but don't expect coherence.
