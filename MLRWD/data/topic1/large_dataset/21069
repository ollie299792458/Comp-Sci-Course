THis moive deserves kudos for treading a new course in the way vampires and werewolves are percieved. To give the two a common ancestry and to focus a movie on that alone allows a freedom to have a viable plot apart from the lame hunting and slaying of humans.

 The weaving of Nighy's and Beckinsale's history into the film grants a humanity that extends the scope of acceptance to viewers who are not intimately familiar or even remotely interested in Vampire or Werewolf lore. As well extending the plot beyond the baseless erradication of one "species" by the other to the bloodline experiment that results in the creation of a "new" creature is genius.

 Provided that the writing of the sequel is of equal calibre I will be camping outside my local AMC or EDWARDS CINEMA; unless I have to work.

 I own this movie because the writing and acting were phenomenal. Though I grant that supernatural beings can combat each other without the aid of pistols and sub-machine guns; is it too far a stretch that these characters take advantage of technoligical advance to wage war. That assertion is as absurd as aking that The current Iran Invasion be fought in trenches as in the second world war. Is it also too taxing on the imagination that over centuries a werewolf be able to master the change, as to not be affected by the moon and to change at whim, it detracts little from their cause as these werewolves are very much embracing their state. (a characteristic less oft displayed of those bitten.)

Let's be serious, these are ficticious creatures to begin with, the reasoning of which is left to the writer to invent. To discredit the movie because the Vampires elect not morph into mist, or bat is childish. write your own movie and the creature can behave in a manner befitting of your expectation.

Hope this review aids your dicision to rent or OWN this classic-to-be.
