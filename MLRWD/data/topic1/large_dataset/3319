If you have ever been to, or dreamed about, going to Venezia, then this is the film for you. Katharine Hepburn is Jane Hudson, a "spinster" from the Midwest who spends part of her longly-anticipated holiday among  the ever-changing light and wildly romantic scenery of Venice. There she  meets, tries to quash, and then gives into her feelings for a Uomo Italiano  (and who could blame her!!!) gorgeously played by Rossano Brazzi. Buona  fortuna- he is too much to resist and they are off on a Venetian adventura  which is as breath- takingly filmed as the rest of the film by David Lean.  One sees Jane lose her inhibitions not only due to her surroundings, but  also because of the situations of the other travelers she meets at her  wonderful (but apparently fabricated -such views, such views!)  pensione.Perhaps you too will find yourself longing for a little get-away  to this city of superlatives and adjectives (can you tell???).I found  myself "telling" Jane to get over her hesitations and "go  for it!" The color process of this film really comes to light with the  red shoe Jane purchases for her BNO (Big Night Out).See SUMMERTIME at any  time of the year for a smile which will stay on your face for along time to  come.
