Zombies of Mass Destruction is a smart zombie film. And entertaining as hell - it's quirky and gross and I loved it. It plays right into a particular kind of horror sub-genre. If you love '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OQCV56">The Twilight Saga: New Moon (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>', ZMD might not be your style. If you loved '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157362408X">Dead Alive</a>', this is going to be right up your alley. It's (slightly) less bloody but the jokes are better.

ZMD has everything you could want in a zombie movie. Starting with the obvious, lots of zombies that want nothing more than to eat your brains. If you get bitten you turn into one of them, straight out of 'Zombies for Dummies'.

As mentioned, the film has lots of humor. All kinds of humor in fact. Political humor, racial humor, gay jokes, religious jokes - all with a touch of bloodspatter and brain matter. The second time I watched it was even funnier than the first, which to me really adds a lot of points.

Yes, it's an independent film, so you won't find any major Hollywood stars in it (at least not yet), but personally I think it adds to the experience. It's fresh! At times hilarious, at times making you cringe - the cast does a great job all the way around.

I think ZMD is the best zombie movie to come out since '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006A9FKA">Shaun of the Dead</a>'.
