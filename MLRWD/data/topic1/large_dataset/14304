Just received my WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE set and while I love the series, after just watching the first episode...the transfer is not clear on my SONY WEGA Wide-Screen TV.  The picture goes from clear to blurry and the picture has a fine line pattern to it.  I have many, many DVDs of old TV Series RE. ANDY GRIFFITH, DICK VAN DYKE, etc. and this is the only set I have noticed this problem with.  I am hoping that it is just unique to the PILOT episode.  Also, the back of the box taughts the EXTRAS and so far I discovered the 3 COLOR episodes are not recently colorized, technilogically advanced episodes BUT old colorized 1990's episodes that the text preceeding the episodes says how poorly it was done?  Then to make matters a bit worse, the rest of the FEATURES on disc one are text pages/bios that are absolutely worthless.  I thought they stopped calling text screen BIOS FEATURES after the very first DVDs came out.  I am hoping there are real Documentaries on the rest of the discs and some RARE stuff that is worthwhile.  I gave this set 3 stars not for the quality of the GREAT series BUT for the quality of this NEW LINE release from what I have watched so far.
