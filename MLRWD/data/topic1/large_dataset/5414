This movie was about the life of the 14th reincarnation of the Dali Lama.  He was found in a small town in Tibet as a child only 2 years of age.  They believed that this child was the Dali Lama, just based upon a few observations that they had.  They put a few items in front of him and some belonged to the Dali Lama's of the past and mixed in some items that were the same but had no meaning.  The child was able to identify all the items that had belonged to the pervious Dali Lama's and even responded that they belonged to him.  This movie explores the life of the child growing up being a very religious figure.  The 14th Dali Lame was eventually exiled out of Tibet, and taken to India for his safety and for his people.  He still resides there today.  This movie relates to my religions class because right now we are working on Buddhism.  This movie showed the life of the monks and there practices.  It showed there rituals and chanting that they did.  It really gave an inside look of the temple and how things work.  It also gave a sense of the middle way and how they truly believed that living a certain way would bring enlightenment.  There no violent methods of thing was also very important, they didn't fight back just transported the 14th Dali Lama to India.  For their thought was every action has a reaction. This movie kinda had the same non violent concept of the last movie that we watched which was Ghandi.  that movie was about Hinduism and this movie is about buddhism.  I think that Buddhism is a very unigue religion and this movie showed all the details and the thoughts behind the religion.  It was like you were right there with the Dali lama as he grew up to fast.
