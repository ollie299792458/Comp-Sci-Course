This is such a magnificent film, I'll never do it justice with words, nor do I have the time now to try. Victor Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m's performance brought me to tears. Bibi Andersson and Ingrid Thulin are both remarkable. I have read that Bergman had to work hard to convince Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m to do this film. He was apparently retired, burned-out, and withdrawn when Bergman approached him - i.e. the perfect man for the role. This film has such a simple metaphorical elegance and is filmed so beautifully as to evoke awe. All elements work with grace and beauty. I have experienced no scene in cinema like the end of this film when old Isak stands at the edge of the lake and sees his parents dressed in luminous white waving to him affectionately from across the water. The effect is almost overwhelming and cannot be reduced to any analysis of artistic technique. I feel such a powerful upwelling of both joy and sorrow...What a work! There's so much more to say but it's pointless. You must experience this masterpiece.
