This has got to be the best music DVD or video ever! Dream Theater is the best. I still can not believe the radio or MTV overlooks them. Instead we get boy bands and cRap, I mean Rap. You will not be disappointed. It covers the entire Metropolis Pt. 2 CD and has some extras from prior albums, including a 23 minute song, A Change Of Seasons. They play their long songs without mistakes and everyone stays in sync,(No Boy Band pun intended!) what power houses! The only bad thing is the hypnotist at the beginning seems to shout to compensate for the audience, kinda unrelaxing.(His very words are "Close your eyes and begin to relax.") Also the actors playing in the story line are kinda lame, it's trying too hard to parllel the dialog and ends up really silly. Plus they don't look too 1920's as the album depicts them. Once you get past the first few minuts of double, mirror images and METROPOLIS/ tie dye screens superimpossed over the footage it gets really good. I'm glad I bought this.
