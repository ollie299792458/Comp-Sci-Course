David Mamet films routinely attract diverse and talented actors who are thrilled to have the opportunity to work with one of the most distinctive and respected artists in the world. Starting with the superb The Spanish Prisoner, David Mamet has gone about the business of quietly becoming one of the very best writer/directors working in Hollywood. The Winslow Boy, State & Main and now Heist make it 4 for 4 and with each film it seems that Mr. Mamet is becoming more and more confident with the camera and cinematic technique. 
The script itself is a faithful model of the genre tweaked with Mamet's unique dialogue. And while DeVito and the great Ricky Jay are blessed with some sweet zingers, this is the first time where it seems a little stilted and tired. It still ranks as a top drawer script, especially when compared to the depressingly dull typing that usually passes for genre writing, but occassionally, with Hackman and Lindo, it breaks the spell of the movie. Which is in NO way meant to denigrate the terrific work done by those two great actors. They bring an emotional heft to the story that is a pleasure to watch.
Rebecca Pidgeon is a unique actress who manages the difficult trick of being brainy, sexy, aloof and intriguing all at the same time. She has been unfairly maligned by some critics to the point of libel and it is their loss because she is a true talent and a breath of fresh air when it comes to movie actresses. Her work in State & Main was one of last year's most overlooked great performances and she expertly pitches her performance here to maximize the tension and keep the audience guessing. My only quibble is that it is hard to buy her ditching Hackman for Sam Rockwell.
