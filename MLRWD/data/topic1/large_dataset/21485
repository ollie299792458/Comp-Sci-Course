I honestly went into watching this thinking it would be a disaster, but ended up being pleasantly surprised.  I'm not well versed in Broken Lizard productions, but I highly doubt this release will taint their reputation.

Plot wise it's basically a slap-stick version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PMGS6S">Waiting... (Unrated and Raw) [Blu-ray</a>] only not only do the wait staff have to deal with irritating customers, they have to seduce them into spending big to become the top seller and win a prize.  Like "Waiting" there are lots of hilarious stereotyped characters both as the wait staff and the clientele.  For anyone who's ever worked in the restaurant industry, there's sure to be some extra laughs as you recognize the hideous truth in some of the comedy.

Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anyone.  Surprisingly the simple idea sustains its humor the whole way through and manages a good number of chuckles and knee slaps.  It's hardly a masterpiece, so I don't know that I can recommend it enough to Buy it, but if you're looking for something to grab from the redbox or watch online this flick is a great way to spend an hour and a half of your time.
