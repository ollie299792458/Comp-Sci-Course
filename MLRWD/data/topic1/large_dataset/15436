A masterpiece, plain and simple.  Deserving 10, if not 20 Oscars which it didn't win.  A classic.  Now that that is out of the way, let me go on a little rant.
To the reviewer that said "Science Fiction" as the title of their review, films are NOT documentaries.  They are meant as a form of entertainment, not too educate, get that through your skull.  As for the fight in the beginning, that happened all the time in this period in this city - cops were there solely to keep the poor from assaulting the rich.  As for the most sophisticated city, research the history of New York.  It is gory, blood soaked, corrupt, and violent in this period.  Scorsese (a person worthy of Kubrick-like praise if there ever was one) captured this very well.  Research before you make stupid claims.
As for the people that say DiCaprio can't act...what is wrong with you?  The man can act, and act well.  I mean, jealousy must be behind these claims.  That, or you still believe it's "cool" to hate anything involved with Titanic (a very good film once you get past the cheesy love story), which it isn't.  Open your eyes and your mind for once and enjoy the film.  As for Day-Lewis, he does an amazing job, worthy of Marlon Brando in "On the Waterfront".  Him being passed up for the uninspired performance of Adrien Brody, just goes too show the Academy Awards aren't based on the best in each category, but most publicly accepted.
So, just see this film, avoiding the nay-sayers.  I'm almost positive you'll at least enjoy, if not love it.
