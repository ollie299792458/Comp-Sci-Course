D-War is by FAR one of the most ambitious movies to come out of Korea.  Let's get this straight.  The cast isn't A-list.  The special effects are not made by ILM.  Spielberg didn't produce this movie.  It was made on a budget that would be laughed out of Hollow-wood.  With all that said, this movie was extremely exciting and a joy to watch as long as you don't take it, or yourselves, too seriously.  Yes, the story was contrite and had plenty of "whatever, come on!" moments, but the premise, was great.  The fact that they didn't cave into the "happy ending" pressures earned kudos in my book.  But let's be clear: it's a giant monster flick.  Dragons!  The concept of fighting dragons is FINALLY dealt with properly from a culture that truly understands the mythos of dragons.  China couldn't have done it any better.  The climatic scene (the fight) was outstanding!  For anyone to expect anymore out of the resources given to this movie, please!  You should be applauding it.  Does it compare to the big budget flix we see in the US?  Of course not!  But considering how many lemmings flock to see the Star Wars movies, the value to cost ratio for this movie was one of the best.
