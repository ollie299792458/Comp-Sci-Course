This DVD production of the story of Jesus has accomplished exactly what I had hoped for my 3yr old son: an interest in learning about the Lord, His involvement in the lives of those who trust Him, His love and miracles, and his Passion and Resurrection.  My son often recites (in surprising detail) various scenes from the tale.  One of my fellow brothers in Christ calls my son "The Little Preacher" because my son enjoys capturing the attention of those around him so he can retell various scenes from the story of Jesus.  I understand some reviewing this telling of the story may prefer stricter adherence to various nuances and literary exactness from Scripture - I can appreciate that as I am a literal believer of Scripture.  There is never a perfect retelling of any Biblical story that will appeal to everyone's preference.  As already mentioned, this achieved what I had hoped for my son: help him develop an interest in learning about the Lord, begin building a faith in the Lord, and understand a need in his life for a relationship with the Miracle Maker.

On a final note, this retelling of the story of Jesus is great for all ages; it enables the family to come together and enjoy a common story.  The mixture of claymation and cartoon was very intriguing and added to the enjoyment of this retelling of Jesus' story.
