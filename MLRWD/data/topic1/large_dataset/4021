Valentine has a decent premise (as far as slashers go) - and a great ending - but the movie as a whole just doesn't reach its own potential. It gets bogged down by too much focus on the women and their relationship issues, which are annoying and uninteresting. It doesn't help that the women have irritating, self-entitled attitudes. Take out the parts with the killer, and this quickly becomes an incredibly lame soap opera.

Another complaint, as shallow as it may sound, is the killer's mask. I mean, I get it: it's a cherubic Cupid looking mask, and the movie is set on Valentine's Day, so it fits. But...it just looks so SILLY. Like a giant baby walking around stabbing people. It's more comical than it is creepy.

I also have to complain about the blatant copying of Halloween. Now, I'm not saying Halloween invented slashers or anything, but this movie specifically does take scenes from the Halloween series. Example? Remember the part where Michael peers over the handrail at the top of the stairs? A scene in this movie is IDENTICAL. The music also clearly borrows a few parts from Carpenter's classic score.

In short, it's pretty disappointing to watch, because you can't help but feel it could have been a lot better than it ended up being.
