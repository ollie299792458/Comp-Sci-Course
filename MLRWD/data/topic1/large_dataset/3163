The Haunting is the latest version of The Haunting of Hill House, and as far as basic films go, it's not too bad. With Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta Jones, plus every special effect possible, should be difficult to go  wrong. 
However, the Haunting is lacking a certain - something. There are  occasions where it hovers between being an out and out gore fest and a  psychological thriller, never giving itself to either of the two. The  characters are not brilliantly developed, leaving the viewer relying on  rather cliched first impressions. The character of Eleanor, particularly,  is left to languish when there is much more we could know about her,  notably her links to Hill House. One of the main characters gets killed off  apparently as an afterthought (coming to a decidedly sticky end in the  fireplace) when Neeson and Zeta Jones who had the same level of importance  were staggering out at the end.
The story may be a bit confusing, but the  effects are very good, taking full advantage of ornate and intricate  decorations to threaten and foreshadow (who didn't wonder, seeing the long  decorative spikes above Eleanor's bed, what they would be doing later on?)  However effects don't make a film (I may be wrong, look at the Matrix) and  this could have benefitted from a more thought out script. Otherwise, not a  bad hour or so.
