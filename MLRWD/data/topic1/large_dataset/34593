I'm not an avid comic reader, so I've never actually read "X-Men" before( though this movie made me want to read it).  Still, the storyline was easy to follow, and I could tell that a lot of characters had to be cut so that the few which remained had enough depth to give the movie some dimension.  Bryan Singer is an absolutely awesome director; he is at his best again with an ensemble cast ( much like his '95 thriller "The Usual Suspects").  My personal favorite is Wolverine and Magneto: Hugh Jackman can't be replaced, and Ian Mckellen shines also.  
What makes "X-Men" so interesting and different from regular good guy-bad guy action movies the most, though, is that there isn't that obvious distinctness which seperate them.  Magneto and his pack seem like they're all evil and the X-men all good, but they are not without its flaws.  They aren't Supermen; they are human.  But those are the traits which make them seem like true heroes-at least in my viewpoint.  
Don't miss the action sequences also-they're completely breath-stopping!  4.5/5
