The CG reworking done to the 2.0 version of this movie is probably not needed.  A good comparison is what George Lucas did with the original star wars trilogy.  Things were added here and there, some made things look better other times it made the movie itself worse.  It's also very similar to the limited edition star wars releases on dvd a few years back.  Like those discs this also includes the original theatrical release.  So if you are a purist and much rather watch the movie as originally intended you are able to do so.  I watched 2.0 once through but I imagine any further rewatching will be done with the theatrical version included as a special feature.

Anyway,  With how this disc was handled I can't help but highly recommend it to any fan of Ghost in the shell.  Even if you already own the original dvd this is a worthy upgrade even if you only watch the theatrical version for the higher bitrate.  The original GITS movie had some severe macroblocking issues that this disc does not have.  I never saw the re-release done a few years back so I can't compare but it's a vast improvement over the original.

If it wasn't for the inclusion of the theatrical I would have given it 4 stars instead of 5.  Even with the all the issues I have with the 2.0 remake, I still feel this is the definitive release of the movie for now.
