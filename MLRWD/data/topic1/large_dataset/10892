I was a huge fan of the original PREDATOR and recommend it to any sci-fi/action movie fan. But when I first saw PREDATOR 2 I was surprised at how big a dissapointment it was to the first movie. Danny Glover was pretty good as Mike Harrigan but he nowhere compares to Arnold, and the rest of the characters were just there to add a few more lines to the script. The one character I did find amusing was Bill Paxton, who, once again, dies acting obnoxious and herioc.
  The actual Predator was very impressive and had a lot more weapons than the one in the original, which I thought was cool. My favorite was the Smart Disk, which cut Gary Busey's character Keys in half. Stan Winston did another excellent job with the Predator, as he does in all his movies. The only thing I didn't like was how long it took for Steven Hopkins, the director, to reveal the actual creature. We've already seen it before, what's the point of holding it off until twenty minutes into the movie?
  The movie has quite a few good action scenes in the movie which do not disappoint, filled with blazing guns and buckets of blood on the floor. The thing that doesn't make sense is why they had a full minute of pure uneccesary nudity involving a prostitute and a gang member. A second later five Jamacians come in and the Predator just ends up killing them all.
  The light and sound in the film are very good for a cruddy movie and Fox did a good job. The extras include two featuretts including talks with the actors and the making of the Predator. There is also a theatrical trailer.
  Overall PREDATOR 2 is a fun movie to watch and should be part of any die hard fan's collection.
