I liked this movie because it was such a unique idea (at least to me).  Who would've thought of making a movie about a film writer in the 1950s who was accused of being a communist and who drives off one night and accidentally goes off a bridge, hits his head and wakes up on a beach with amnesia in a town where he happens to look exactly like a guy who's been missing in action for 9 and 1/2 years and who everyone is so happy to see, huh?  The conflict being - will he ever remember who he is, and if so, will the government find him, and what will the whole town that he's fallen in love with think?  It's such an interesting story.  Kind of slow paced - but REALLY good if you like those sorts of movies that have a feel good ending with a hero who "finds himself" and leaves a special mark in the lives of some really kind people and ends up being the winner he never knew he truly was.  I only gave it four stars because I wish the DVD had more special features like how they made the movie, but I loved the movie itself.  Watch it! The acting is SUPERB.
