I first saw Babette's Feast in the late 80's - it seemed a dark and sumptuous film, watching it again recently I was stunned again by its simplicity and the beauty not only of the film but the characters and the values it espouses. Set in rural Denmark in the years after the Franco-Prussian war it is the story of two Christian sisters and their 'housekeeper', a woman who had fled Paris and her own personal tragedy. Her background is a secret and no one enquires, or even appears the wonder about her until she serves the sisters and their little band of brethren a feast, then it becomes apparent to us that she is none other than the famous Parisiene chef who designed meals of breath taking creativity during the reign of Napoleon 111. The brethren are so frightened of the gift she gives them that they determine not to taste or comment on the meal but Babette's art works a magic of its own and the gift she gives these dour people is more than food. The film is charming, a little bit of melancholy and lost opportunity drifts through it, but mingled with the sadness there is a sort of peace and joy. I loved it!
