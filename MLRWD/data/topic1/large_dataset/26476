An action movie can only be as good as it's leading actor. That's why this edition of the Boure Trilogy is the best yet. Matt Damon has evolved into a bona fide movie star, an action hero that can bring a movie to the strongest levels of entertainment. As Jason Bourbe, he shines, especially as he begins to unravel the mystery surrounding his identity. He plays the role both with the male bravado you expect from an action star, and with great heart when he realizes who he is and what the CIA had created within him. This movie is non stop special effects and the stunts are
electryfying. To me, this what the movies are all about. I was glued to the screen..Supporting cast is a superb ensemble of established stars..but it is undeniably Matt Damon's movie. He is Jason Bourne. He's come a long way from the preppy anti semetic student in school days. His roles are all diversified, but carefully chosen, and his brilliance as in Good Will Hunting, shows brightly in this Bourdne movie. I hope the franchise continues.
