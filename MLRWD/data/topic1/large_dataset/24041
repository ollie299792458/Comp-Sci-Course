First off, I must say that I have NEVER given a 5-star review for anything on this site...I feel that 5 stars is perfect and that perfection is nearly impossible to achieve.  That being said...this movie is perfect.  No, it doesn't have the strongest plot, nor the best acting, nor a very big budget, or even stunning visuals...but it doesn't need them.  This is a Bruce Campbell movie made BY Bruce for the fans of his work.  This may be one of the corniest movies you will ever see, but for fans of Bruce (the greatest actor of his generation....or pretty much any generation for that matter) this movie is solid gold genius.  The film has something for every Campbell fan from the casual viewer to the fan who has memorized the B.C. books and owns at least 3 different versions of Army of Darkness.  If you are the former, get this movie...it's great.  If you are the latter, then you shouldn't be reading this because you pre-ordered this puppy months ago!!!  With this film Bruce proved once again that he is the king of "B" movies...Hail to the king, baby!!!
