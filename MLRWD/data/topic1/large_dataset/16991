I just saw this film again for about the 5th time.Great films you can see over and over again, and each time a new revelation. I'm a first generation Italian American, and the 2nd time I saw this film it became autobiographical to me. My whole childhood was spread before me--vividly.My mother, my first love, etc. I identified with Toto.
A new revelation the 5th time: those censored film cuts the adult Toto views at the end are not just simply Alfredo's nostalgic and amusing gift, they represent the whole history of cinema in about 2 minutes. Toto recognized that as a filmmaker--you can see it in his face.
Jack Lemmon once said, "You can make them laugh, you can make them cry; if you can make them laugh AND cry, boy oh boy..." That's Cinema Paradiso.

As an added note, I just saw the Director's cut version, and I must say the film is the richer for it--the love scene in the car on the beach at the end with the adult Toto and Elena is one of the most moving and joyful I've ever seen.They found each other again, and you know Elena is destined to spend some time in Rome in the future--no matter what they say.Love conquers all.This is, of course, the real ending. And the nostalgia at the end with the film clips becomes just a postscript. Toto leaves, makes his mark, and comes back to find the girl. Alfredo would have been satisfied with that.The film editors should have ignored their watches.
