D&eacute;j&agrave; vu is the experience of a compelling sense of familiarity, as in "been there, done that" or in the case of Nanking: "I've seen this before!"

 D&eacute;j&agrave; vu is often accompanied by a sense of "Weirdness" as in reading these pious reviews emphasizing what are claimed to be the unique features of "Nanking." Its weird and strange because what they are really describing are the unique features of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CETW4Y">Rape of Nanking</a> produced and directed by Rhawn Joseph, Ph.D.

According to the reviews: We get to see the people of Nanking living their happy, peaceful lives before the Japanese attack---yes, right out of Joseph documentary, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CETW4Y">Rape of Nanking</a>. Then we see  the battle of Shanghai--again, right out of Joseph's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CETW4Y">Rape of Nanking</a>.  Next we see the carnage on the road to Nanking--Its Deja Vu all over again, right out of Joseph's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CETW4Y">Rape of Nanking</a>. Next the safety zone, featuring Rabe and the others. Surprise! Again, right out of Rape of Nanking.

Maybe the Amazon page featuring Rape of Nanking got mixed up with Nanking? No, the sad truth is there is nothing original and nothing new or daring or exciting about Nanking. Everything about it is Blah, and when they are not following the roadmap laid out by Joseph's film, they revert to the standard cookie cutter formula.  It is standard procedure to mix interviews with archival film in a documentary , and almost every documentary on the Rape of Nanking includes interviews with victims, witnesses, and the same Japanese soldiers. The only exception is Joseph's movie which dared to be different and which was  already receiving wide acclaim in the Chinese media long before the billionnaire from AOL announced plans to do a film on this tragedy.

There are also a few other notable differences. Joseph's film displays quotes from John Rabe, Safety Zone members, victims, witnesses,  and Japanse soldiers, superimposed on images of horror. Nanking uses horrible actors to read these quotes.

Joseph uses traditional and classical Japanese and Chinese music played by Japanese and Chinese musicians. The producer of Nanking hired a jazz musician.

Joseph's film was a completely independent production.

Nanking was made with the help of the Communist Government of China.

Joseph's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CETW4Y">Rape of Nanking</a> was shown in theaters filled to capacity in the US and China. It has been viewed over 6 million times in the US, and an additional estimated 10 million times world wide. There are over 30,000 comments posted online about his film, and it was ranked in the top 10 Most Discussed Films of All Time during 2007. All the major Chinese media praised this film over and over again.

By contrast, Chinese audiences avoided Nanking, which failed in China after just a few days, an incredible humiliation for the producer and director. Of course, in the US we were told exactly the opposite by media outlets linked to the producer and his friends.

Joseph's film left audiences in shock and tears. Audiences for Nanking left the theater.

There is nothing original about Nanking. It lacks passion, insight, depth, feeling, emotion and the acting is bad.  The film stars Woody Harrelson, the joke-cracking bartender from the TV comedy show "Cheers." Woody Harrleson starring in the Nanjing Massacre? Was Woody Allen not available? Then there is Ms. Hemmingway who is wooden, phony and seems incapable of conveying real emotion.

Why have a bunch of actors reading, yes, actually reading out loud from books? Was it too much trouble to have them learn their lines?  There is no passion, no depth, the motives of the Japanese and the betrayals which led up to this massacre go unexplained. It seems the director and producer did everything they could to keep out anything remotely controversial, when in reality the whole issue is extremely controversial and upsetting. One also gets the sense this film was quickly thrown together by people who cared nothing about this issue but who were simply eager to capitalize on and to exploit the 70th anniversary of this tragedy to make a lot of money. They not only failed to make a good movie, the producer is quoted as admitting he lost money.

The choice should be clear: the best, completely original, and most popular, most viewed, and most shocking, upsetting, and frightening documetary film ever made about  the Nanjing Massacre is Joseph's  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CETW4Y">Rape of Nanking</a>. You don't have to believe me.  The statistics are easily checked,  and the reviews published in the Chinese media prove it: "The best, most influential film ever made on this tragedy outside of China." --China Central TV
