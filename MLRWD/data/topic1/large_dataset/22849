Yes, this movie is produced by Michael Bay, and it's obvious.  Beautiful, dark haired heroine.  Check.  In panties more often than not.  Check.  Loud, obnoxious light and sound effects.  Check.  Michael Bay.
In spite of his heavy-handed touch, The Unborn works surprisingly well.  It's a creepy tale, full of nerve-wracking moments, which more often than not play like a true homage to the best J-Horror movies, and not simply as a failed Western remake.
There are some genuinely creepy moments, and they usually defy typical, logical explanation.  That's the essence of J-Horror to me.  Things happen, and they can't always be explained.

The heroine plays like a more thoughtful, better realized version of the typical Michael Bay / Meghan Fox character, and Gary Oldman does his usual fine job playing a role one couldn't possibly believe he'd be playing.  A Rabbi?
Gary Oldman as a Rabbi?
I love Gary Oldman.

The movie might not win any awards, but it's got some genuine chills and scares, and it's well worth seeing.
