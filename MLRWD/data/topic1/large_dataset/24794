I am a total sucker for Charlie Chan films. I loved them as a kid and missed them for the nearly 2 decades that they disappeared from television because of charges of negative Asian stereotyping. I have purchased all of the available Chan collections on DVD and eagerly await the release of the remaining couple of Sidney Tolers and the last few with Roland Winters.

However, in watching the Chans again on DVD, I can recognize something that eluded me as a boy----that there is a drop in quality after the series moved to Monogram. I am not saying anything here that others have not said, but while I still enjoy them to some degree, watching Sidney Toler turn into a straight man for the comedy-team antics of Jimmy Chan (Benson Fong) and Birmingham Brown (Mantan Moreland) is a bit off-putting.

All of which actually makes me cherish the last of the great Chans even more. While "Wax Museum" and "Dead Men Tell" are not classics, "Murder Over New York", "Castle In The Desert", "In Panama", "In Rio" and "Murder Cruise" are vintage Charlie: very good stories, very good timing and very good acting.
