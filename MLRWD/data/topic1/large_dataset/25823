This movie was not all that bad, to me. It was a pretty good attempt at fleshing out end times events and I can appreciate that. For a low budget movie, I say they did a pretty good job. I did feel, however, that there  were some big weaknesses it though. The military power and influence of  Micheal York's character was not established enough for me. When he started  barking out for his Generals to act, I wondered who he was refering to. His  military influence was nowhere spelled out. And Casper Van Dien's Tony  Robins like character was a bit too much in the talk show sceens. I can't  believe he let the director make him jump around like he did. Other than  that, Van Dien is a pretty good actor to me. The Abomonation that makes  Desolate scene was the WORST!  Personally, I REALLY like Micheal  Ironside's character; seeing him in an Orthodox Jewish costume gave me a  new respect for him having a good sense of humor. Like I said, it's a  pretty good attempt on this topic. If the producers make another film on  this or other topic and listen to some of the critique here, I believe that  a really good work that is widely accepted is possible.
