Cristian Mungiu's film "4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days" is an awe-inspiring--if it can be called such--adventure. The director has such pointed and striking control over the picture that is difficult to imagine the film being better anchored by any other director. The tale is a two hour escape with two young women, Otilia and Gabita, as they traverse an antagonistic political climate that not-so-subtly rears its head in the most "modern" of our contemporary landscapes. The director avoids the didactic suggestions of other theme-driven tales by homing in on the singularity of the human moment. The film's script and acting performances shine due to their experiential nature; meanwhile, the auditory nuances are in perfect complement with the film's stark cinematography. Ultimately, "4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days" is a landmark film, an undeniably powerful encounter with Romania's ominous history and our distance, though shared, existence with characters like Otilia and Gabita not so long ago.
