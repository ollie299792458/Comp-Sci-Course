This is Quentin Tarantino's first film. Before this he was working in a video rental store, on this DVD Quentin Tarantino tells you his story about how he started. He wrote a few screenplays and they were all not that good. He then wrote this one and luckily it found its way into the hands of Harvey Keitel. Keitel called Tarantino and offered help in producing this film. After that they began work on this Classic Crime film.

Reservoir Dogs is about a powerful mob boss and his son. They both hire four perfect killers for the perfect crime. Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Pink and Mr. Orange. Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue are in there too but they don't really have a huge role (They both die, not a big surprise) When this caper goes awry and results in a bloody massacre there is only one explanation. Theres a rat in the house.

Beautiful acting, great camera work and a real gangster like atmosphere. This movie is the real deal. Graphic violence and pervasive language can make it a little intense. But if you like crime films, Quentin Tarantino or really like movies then buy or rent it. If you dont like blood and language makes you feel uncomfortable then stay away. If you like this then you will also like 'Pulp Fiction'
