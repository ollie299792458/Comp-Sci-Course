I was too young to appreciate this movie when it came out in 1981.  I must have seen the famous beach scene with the Vangelis theme so many times but never watched the real movie.  Now I have and it was a remarkable film.  It honors running with one man running for the pleasure of God and one man running to fight both real and perceived prejudice.  It depicts the Britain of old but one can sense the waning hour ahead.  Eric Liddell came across as too good to be true but it turns out he was an even more remarkable character in real life.  He is best described by his quote to his sister about why he chooses to run even when it may seem the running displaces his true missionary purpose.  "I believe that God made me for a purpose, but He also made me fast. When I run, I feel His pleasure."  Harold Abrahams was intense  feeling compelled to always overcome the bigotry and slights that came with being Jewish in the WASP world of Cambridge and the elite British world it represented.  When he was told you are here and made it by his future wife he described himself as "semi-deprived. It means they'll lead me to water, but they won't let me drink."  This is a quiet movie with great acting that probably would not receive its due attention if it were made today.
