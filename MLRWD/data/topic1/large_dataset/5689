I thouhgt this was an excellent movie. It had a multifaceted plot that kept you guessing throughout the movie, with many twists and turns within the plot.  It had the suspense of the war and the main character hiding from the Nazis. It had the slow growing romance of the main character and the man who chose to help hide her. It had many side issues of the relational intricacies; a young boy and his step father, the school teacher and the boy, the woman with the abusive husband who escapes to a new life with her father in law.  Elza/Hannah struggles to find acceptance with the town's people, and must cope with the  personal culture shock from the life she had before in the city as a medical student, and the life in the tiny mountain town, while still hiding her identity and past from both the Nazi soldeiers and the town's people.  I hated the ending, but it highlighted the senslessness of both war and drunkeness.  In fact I felt it showed the brutality of drunkeness as more continuously dangerous than the war itself.  Wars end, drunkenes just goes on and on , weaved into the fabric of the people's lives, maiming and destroying many.
