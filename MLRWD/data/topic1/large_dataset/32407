Another reviewer has quoted an unnamed reviewer (I assume of this movie) as asking "What story did it tell me? What aspect of our world did it illuminate? What did it show about, say, evil that I didn't already know before?"
Gosh, I wonder what percentage of all the world's movies would meet those criteria?  Let me suggest my own questions:
Did I enjoy it?  (Yes!)  Was it well-done?  (Marvelously!)  Was the ending satisfying?  (Certainly as satisfying as any other tragedy.)
I've seen ratings of this movie that stressed "Strong sexual content."  I assume they were referring to the full male and female nudity.  Interestingly, I don't recall any sexual acts -- maybe they were just irrelevant among the multitude of overwhelming visual delights.
Try to see this on a big screen (home theater) as its sweep is almost comparable to "Prospero's Books" -- although much less dense in detail.  While Prospero leaves you gasping from sensory overload, "The Cook..."  will widen your eyes to take in the beauty of individual scenes.
