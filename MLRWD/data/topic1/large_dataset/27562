Terry Thorne (Russel Crowe), a kidnap and ransom negotiator for an insurance company, is sent to the country of Tecala in South America to negotiate the release of engineer Peter Bowman (David Morse).  The insurance is canceled, as well as the negotiation, but Peter's wife Alice (Meg Ryan) asks Terry to help and they both have to cope with their growing attraction as they work together.

Taylor Hackford's film is doubly courageous and unique:

First, it addresses the idea of private rescue, both business and personal, in an age when most people look to the state for protection from criminals.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005BCKF">Proof of Life</a> not only illustrates the business aspect of private rescue (through an insurance company), but the idea that personal action of rescue can come from the the heart.  Some reviewers try to include the state as a player by mentioning that the kidnapers are antigovernment and that Thorne once worked for a government.

Second, the movie illustrates doing the right thing (though perhaps after stepping over the line depending on how the viewer interprets one scene).

This is rated R and the foul language and profanity are very bad.  The language issue makes it hard to share the movie with others.  I considered dropping a star, but because of the above two points did not.

Action and ideas in a very good movie.
