I became hooked on Michael Flatley and Irish Dancing after seeing a performance of Riverdance on TV.  Next I purchased the DVD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FVDQO">The Michael Flatley Collection (Lord of the Dance/Feet of Flames/Michael Flatley Gold)</a> and enjoyed each performance more than the last.  At the time there were no DVD's of Celtic Tiger available but I learned the show was coming to Reno, NV, where I lived at the time.

Seeing the live performance of Celtic Tiger from the center of the 12th row left myself and my guests nearly speachless.  The dancing and the storyline were flawlessly inter-woven.  The feet of the dancers were nearly a blur as they tapped their way through the story.  Each time Michael appeared on stage his energy and fabulous performance electrified the audience bringing us to a higher level of excitement.  The abslute highlight was the finale and 2 encores of Yankee Doodle Dandy which brought tears to my eyes as the feeling of patriotism flowed through the audience.

The dvd of Celtic Tiger was released several months after the live performance that I was priveledged to view.  Watching the DVD allows me to re-live one of the high points of my life; the live performance of Celtic Tiger.  While the filmography is excellent nothing can compare to actually being there although the DVD does come close.  Highly Recommended!

I've read other reviewers comments that they do not believe Celtic Tiger is Michael's best work.  I disagree.  Celtic Tiger was an evolution bringing together the best of dance, showmanship, and choreography into a breathtaking performance.  Change is inevitable and without it comes stagnation.  However everone has a right to their own opinion.  To me, Celtic Tiger will always remain the highlight of Michael's danceing career.
