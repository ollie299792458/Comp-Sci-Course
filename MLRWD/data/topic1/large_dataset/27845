Its one of the few things I liked about the whole cutural genere, its part action flick - but a tad to racy for kids [although some of the nude scences are approched in day time soaps now] . I was trying to find this in CD or DVD format and couldn't. but when I found it in digital format I decided to go for it [and - besides it was only 9.95 so it wasn't a wallet buster] . plot centers around a nasty little green orb called Loc-nar that kills a small girls dad after he retreaves the thing from someplace else. Then when he gets it back home and shows it to his daughter&lt; he handles it and it kills him in seconds and backs her into a corner and begins a multiplicity of yarns to scare the blazes out of her..

  The b-17 part was the most macaube , the cabby part pretty funny.. Though it will be interesting to see if we have flying cars by 2030 [date in the future for the show]. slightly cheesy, but a fairly deceint animation flick.

  you just might be hard pressed to find a non-DL version of it though.
