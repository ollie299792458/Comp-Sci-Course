This movie started fine -- nice artwork, baby/mommy horse, those kinds of things.

Then it had my 3 year old son screaming and crying inside of 15 minutes, when the soldiers come and tie the horse up and start dragging him around. Then he is repeatedly beaten, then starved, and shot at. More screaming and crying, more of me hurriedly pressing skip, skip, and trying to explain what was going on...

OK, this is supposed to be a kids movie, I kept telling myself, surely there would be something a little "scary"... but then it would be over.

As soon as I thought that, then out come the guns -- really? The protagonist cartoon horse in a rated G movie has to get SHOT AT?

The horses get beaten/tied/up/captured just about every 10 minutes throughout the movie.

Because there is also a Native American theme to this movie, we get treated to a cavalry charge slash indian massacre slash redirect into the horses getting washed down a river until you think one of them is dead...

I was so disgusted with this movie that I will now stay far away from any kids product with a Dreamworks label.
