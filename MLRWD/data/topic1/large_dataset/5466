I thought Law & Order had set the bar pretty high for a cop serial (even though it doesn't focus spc. on the cops, I know, I know), but as far as entertainment goes, you can't beat The Shield.

You can guarantee what's going to happen on Law & Order: someone's gonna get murdered, and there will be a trial. The Shield guarantees none of that, except maybe the murder. If there is a trial, you ain't gonna see it, and if Det. Vic Mackey and his Strike Team deal with a problem the way they want, ain't gonna be no trial, either.

Following a team of cops that are corrupted to varying degrees puts a whole new slant on the cop show. It's hard to know whether to cheer for Mackey or not as he makes decisions that frequently have little to do with police ethics.

Cringe as he doesn't remove children from a crackhouse, but instead advises the owner "to put 'em in the back room and rent the Lion King... just keep them away from this s***."  Watch in disbelief as he beats a hooker (at her request) so that her story about killing a john will wash with the cops.

And through all this, Mackey is a) trying to avoid the net of Capt. Aceveda, which gets tighter and tighter following the wickedest decision Mackey makes in the series' first episode and b) trying to save his family and his son, whose learning disability becomes painfully clear midway through the first season.

Add a stellar cast of characters and just the right amount of T&A, violence and ignorant jokes (hey, what can I say, I'm a 24-year-old male...), and you've got an appallingly great show that I'm just now getting into.

I watched the first season in less than two days. Probably ditto for the second season, which just came in today's mail. Compelling is the only way to describe it. Can't wait for the new season on F/X.

If you're a big Law & Order fan, and ESPECIALLY if you liked Homicide: Life on the Street, this is the show for you.
