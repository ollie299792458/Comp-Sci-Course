The highlight of this fabulous 2-disc edition of the Berlin-Astair-Garland "Easter Parade" is the movie itself. The picture quality exceeds in richness, clarity, and color any version, including, I'm sure, the original theater release. As soon as Fred Astaire appears and you see the vivid purple boutineer on his lapel, you know you are in for a visual treat.

But it doesn't stop there. The sound quality has also been upgraded. It's a pure delight to view and hear.

There is not a bad song or dance number in the lot, and a good number are true classics. Examples: the two-bum piece, "A Couple of Swells," is one of the most beloved pieces of film in existence; Ann Miller, who, we learn in an accompanying interview, was recovering from a broken back and in serious pain, does what she considers her finest number. The list goes on and on, not excluding the unutterably touching title song sung by Judy to Fred, who seems more moved than the audience.

If you have any love at all for the golden age of MGM musicals, this one's a must.
