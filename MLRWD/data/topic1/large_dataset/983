The beauty of this film is subtle; not only is the camerawork and lighting masterful from the opening scene, but also in the action. Erica Bana has a sequence entirely shot in one take, and not only is it a delicious adrenaline boost, but it has a vintage quality that simply cannot be found in today's A.D.D.-driven close-up-only action scene. There's something a European film does that American films cannot do; American flicks provide a temporary high, which only leave you thirsting for more to no avail----this film gives you satisfaction, knowing that you have witnessed a piece of art....a graphic, intense, quirky, and, most importantly, lovable masterpiece.

It is not only the director who contributes to the quality; the actors give stellar performances. Cate Blanchett's villianous role in this film beats her "Indiana Jones: Crystal Skull" one out of the water. Eric Bana plays the seemingly cold, but deeply noble Teutonic German role like he's not even acting, but like Jet Li or Jackie Chan, execute an art that is truly a part of real life. Lastly, Saoirse Ronan pioneers a role (at least I have) never seen before; untainted innocence meets Valkyrie-esque fierceness. Definitely a role all females (and males, for the sake of choosing their future bride) must witness.:)
Glass ceiling? How about penetrating the depth of the kosmos?
