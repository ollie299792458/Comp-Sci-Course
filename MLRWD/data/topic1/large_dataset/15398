Now you would have to a true optimist to think a Uwe Boll movie based on a video game would be worth watching. And if you were said optimist you would have been sadly let down after watching this sad excuse for a movie. If you manage to sit through the entire movie you are one tough hombre, or blind. Ten minutes in and I was ready to poke my eyes out with my soda straw.

There are some good actors signed up for this movie, which might throw some people. But you can be certain minutes into it that they are just there for a paycheck. The story is cliche and boring, and being it is based on the video game Dungeon Siege that is not surprising. While it might be adequate for a video game based on killing things and taking their treasure to have a barely there story, it doesn't work on the big screen.

If you haven't seen the movie you are a better person for it and it is my solemn responsibility to warn you not to pay actual money for this DVD, or even play money. If you are certain that you want to see it just wait until it finds its way into the 99 cent bin at the local super store. But don't say I didn't warn you.
