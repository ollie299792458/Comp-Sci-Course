Having watched The Siege before, the events of September 11 were a reality check.  One of the first things I thought upon hearing that planes had hit the World Trade Center was of this movie.
While this is a fictional account, it is a somber reminder of what could have happened in real life.  Watching this movie after the attacks, it takes on an entirely different meaning to me.  Everyone has changed in some fashion after the tragedy, and this movie is an example of just how confident we were in our national security.
Denzel Washington, in the lead role, portrays a very convincing anti-terrorism agent with the F.B.I.  The casting of Tony Shaloub (Wings) as his Arab-American partner brings the other side of the argument into play - being blamed for something because you share a race or some other identifiable characteristic with a group.  While this movie was not meant to be any sort of documentary or reality-based production, it also manages to provide a sense of understanding about what the FBI has to do when investigating such incidents.  This movie was good before the attacks, now it it much more meaningful for them.
