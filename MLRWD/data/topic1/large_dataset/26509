Beware of hype.  I was intrigued about this film because of its "heavily censored" history, so when I saw this version was now available I ordered without hesitation.  What's that expression about "looking and leaping"?  Let's cut to the chase....

Two young tourists arrive in a deserted town and find dead bodies, children playing pinata with a corpse, witness a girl beat an old man to death, ....and don't immediately run screaming for the boat and a way off the island?  At that point, I was rooting for the kids.  The children, if possible, are less animated than "Night of the Living Dead" zombies--a film to which this pays homage; in fact, Monty Python's "killer rabbit" was more fearsome and frightening.

I suppose because the killers are children the film received so much negative publicity but I gotta be honest, this did absolutely nothing for me.  The music is appropriately dramatic, the actress screams wonderfully, the locale is beautiful, but as for dramatic tension or chills...nada. A curiosity at best.

(Footnote:  At least the pinkish-red day-glow syrup blood was amusing.)
