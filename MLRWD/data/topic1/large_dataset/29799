This book describes a different exercise routine.  If the author's physique is due entirely to Forza; then it certainly works.  No muscle popping extreme weights.  No funky dance routines either.  You work with a practice (wood or plastic) katana, called a bokken, and the moves are based upon kendo moves...without the formalism of that martial art.  Without the need for blow-absorbing uniforms.  Without the hitting for that matter.
Ilaria, the author and originator, emphasizes the importance of the isometric aspects of bringing the bokken to a sudden stop at a precise point on your imaginary opponent.
Susan and I have been working with this book for a few weeks now and it has certainly captured our interest.  The book is divided into the expected sections; 14 basic exercises, 7 advanced exercises that combine 3 or more basic exercises into something closer to a routine, and 7 longer routines.  Provide your own music.
There are two points that Ilaria doesn't bring out that have struck me.  The first is that this has to be a superior workout if you are at all serious about any sport where grip is important to skill.  Shouldn't matter whether it's golf, tennis, or bullseye pistol shooting.  Every minute of Forza involves the gripping of the bokken with both hands.  And you are likely to be using a serious grip if you are like me; it's almost impossible to not imagine that your "sword" is about to impact something hard and unyielding.
The second is that this should be applicable to the wheelchair and walker crowd with just a little bit of modification.  Our Cold Steel brand bokken weigh less than 1.5 pounds each and that is held in both hands.  Just think, granny arms could become extinct!
This book has 4 stars instead of 5 because I suspect there is an error in the description of one of the basic routines.  The textual description simply doesn't match the pictures.
