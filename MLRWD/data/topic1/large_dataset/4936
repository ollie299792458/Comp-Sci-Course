This movie has some, er, sentimental value to me, since the two moon junction scene was the first sex scene I ever saw -- and, since I was 7 or 8 at the time, it was also (IIRC) my introduction to the idea of sex (or at least naked people kissing ;) ).

In any case, based on a vague memory of that scene and the word "junction" I found this movie again and wanted to see it. The best I can say for it, though, is that it's not horrible. The sex scenes are not bad at all, but they're not exactly great, either.

As a movie experience (vs. a soft porn experience), the movie spends quite a bit of time building April's angst at going into a life that she isn't crazy about but that her whole family wants and expects her to go into. It sets her up to make a difficult choice between what is "best" for her -- a marriage to a successful but plain "company man" fianc&eacute; -- and her libidinous attraction to a muscly carnival worker, a drunken pig with a heart of gold (sort of). Oh yeah, and glasses, which he puts on when he needs to look sophisticated. They seem to want to get the angst across so desperately that not one but TWO sex scenes end with April bursting into tears.

But then it throws all this build-up away with what appears to be a "have your cake and eat it, too" ending that kind of renders the rest of the movie pointless. Is her choice understandable? Certainly. Will you find it satisfying? Depends on if you like the whole having and eating thing, but it certainly isn't compelling.

This is definitely a movie with limited appeal, and it's hard to recommend it as anything more than a possible rental. There will be many who would find it boring, I think.
