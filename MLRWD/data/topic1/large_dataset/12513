1. katia golubeva is one of the most beautiful women in the world
2. david out gallo's vincent gallo as most insensitive, most brutally, hollowly macho lead actor EVER--a guy you love to hate (but of course it's in the script as well)
3.  the desert is shot so beautifully you will wanna plan a trip pronto
4.  this is a film about the violence endemic in america--yeah, typical frenchy frenchy jeremiad, but the pacing, though molasses-slow, is deft and the ending's a shock that, actually, the director has earned.  sorry, haters--it's just too subtle for you.  here's how:  the Hummer, the most reviled yank car (by any sensible person's standards), is symbolic:  it's a goddam tank, yah, but no matter how much we think we can protect ourselves from evil, from violence, from ANYTHING...with our "art" or educations or cars, we're kidding ourselves...also:  29 palms is a BARREN place (like the states--ok, at times, not always) and a milieu that's kept alive by a marine base...basically a training center for people who are programed to shut off all emotion and kill...
5. a second viewing brings out all this stuff--if you just think about it.
6. katia golubeva is the most beautiful woman in...oh i said that already
