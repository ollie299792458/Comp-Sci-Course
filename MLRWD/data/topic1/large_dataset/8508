A movie like Quiz Show is entertaining on so many levels...where to begin.

The opening sequence; I don't know what it is about Bobby Darin singing Mack the Knife and the behind the scenes look at America turning on their TV's, but the opening few minutes pull you into a period of history.

From that sequence the script moves swiftly, the characters are tightly drawn, and the stage is set for a morality play asking viewers about the nature of integrity.

While all acting in this movie is outstanding, the direction almost transcends these solid performances, making the actors look like they are simply doing their job rather than carrying a story.

That said, I really enjoyed Rob Morrow, perhaps for the surprising depth of his acting ability (I didn't know he had it in him). Ralph Fiennes seems like an actor you expect greatness from (and he delivers). Hank Azaria is great. And John Turturo is outstanding.

Overall there are few movies I will watch repeatedly just to follow a sequence or hear an actor utter a few lines of dialog. This is certainly one those movies.

After A River Runs Through It and Quiz Show, you'd think Robert Redford can do no wrong. But then you watch the Horse Whisperer...
