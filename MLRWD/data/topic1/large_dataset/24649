An aging reclusive writer mentors a young, fearless, tough, athletic  talented teenager who shows great promise as a writer, and is brilliant on the basketball court.  The film is about friendship, jealousy, fear, pride, control, manipulation, the art of communication, the bitterness of failure, power,  loyalty, and the beauty of mentorship; that is  sharing ones wisdom with another person.  Sean Connery, Rob Brown, Anna Paquin are a winning combination.  Dialogue is crisp, honest, biting.  An embittered professor who duels mercilessly with his students in class because of his own past failure as a writer is the protagonist.  His character is harsh, cruel and fuels the explosive dynamics of a writing contest on which hinges the scholastic fate and future of the teenager.  Powerful, searing scenes of life at both ends of the survival spectrum.  I really liked this film.  Exceptional acting,  a fine script.  Teach those who can learn, and let them, -no-  help them to grow up intelligent,  productive -  whole and healthy beings.  As the film demonstrates so well, "when people are afraid, they return to their assumptions, and limit themselves."  The characters in this  uplifting film confront their fears.  Intense, taut, excellent!
