Bread and Tulips is wonderful! The DVD cover says it was nominated for international awards and won at least 9 awards; it fully deserves them all!
Its simple tale has all the power and universal grandeur of a classical Greek myth or parable. Mainly set in present-day Venice (probably the world's most romantic city with a poignancy, poetry, and proximity to mythical power uniquely its own), it charts the emotional rebirth of a woman who, at movie's start, has become an awkward stranger to the vibrant beauty of her very own heart.
The lady's emotional healing slowly touches the lives of others in similar emotionally-bereft lives and, with a wonderful economy of psychological insight into the characters, everyone's everyday tragedies transform into meaningful uplifting relationships with a shared music and mutually-loving harmony.
Bread and Tulips is most easily defined as a romantic comedy; yet, it transcends most other modern movies of that genre insofar as it fully honors human emotions and never ridicules or devalues them. A wonderful and heartwarming emotional education of a movie with superb acting igniting it from start to finish; fully recommended.
