Since Paul Walker was in it(and I hate his annoying voice and wooden acting) I was expecting this to be a total disaster. To my surprise it wasn't as terrible as I anticipated. Although if you ask me whether it was a good movie, the answer would be no. Paul(and his baby blue eyes) goes on the road trip along with his dimwitted  jailbird of a  brother and hot(in producer's opinion) chick that he wants desperately. On the way, they decide to play a joke on some trucker who gets pissed off and starts stalking them. Somehow this trucker(whose face we never see) knows everything about them and he appears at the most unexpected moments. Instead of going to the cops, like any normal people, the characters spend the movie trying to run away and outwit this fathom. I thought it was supposed to be suspense thriller but this is definitely "Friday 13th" kind of movie(and I'm not found of those). Paul Walker didn't stink as badly as he did in the "Fast and the Furious", but this LeeLee Sobievski who was playing the "hot" chick is one bad actress(and skanky looking one at that. I suspect the producers had the beer goggles on when she was selected for this role). However, if you compare this film with some of the other crap I've been watching lately, this can almost be called a masterpiece
