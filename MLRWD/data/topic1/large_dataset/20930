So many others have done justice to this outstanding movie, I will focus on technical quality of this DVD. I do love this movie, I've seen it perhaps 15 times in as many years. And of course Casablanca is one of the most quotable movies ever!
The DVD transfer of this B&amp;W classic is OUTSTANDING!! I watch this on my 2200 lumens front projection system. I have an enormous screen measuring 14.5' diagonal! I can easily see the quality of the digital transfer on every DVD, and I am astonished at the high quality of this transfer for Casablanca.
The film noire aspect is perfectly captured in high resolution sharp detail (but not excessively so). You can see absolutely everything ... the patterns on ties, Ingrid's jewelry and beautiful hair, incredible detail on wardrobe and props, etc. If you are used to seeing Casablanca on VHS, then viewing this DVD on a nice home theater system will be like seeing the movie for the first time ... it is so rich in detail.
The quality of the contrast calibration is great! Deep black, crisp white and an excellent transfer curve in between. All the cast look great. They really did an excellent job in transferring this classic film. I know I sound impressed, but I am not exaggerating in the least about the quality ... my home theater screen is huge and this film looks great, as good as anything you would ever see in a cinema. I am not easy to please, and this disc is so well done that this great film is a joy to watch, again and again and again.
The dolby digital 2.0 mono audio transfer is excellent as well. It's hard to believe that this disc is of a film made 61 years ago.
Very well done DVD. Enjoy!
