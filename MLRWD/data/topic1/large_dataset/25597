i'm sorry, but i'm going to have to say that i really wasn't impressed with this show.

well, hang on, i'll start positively as opposed to being 100% negative.

the animation quality is superb... it's rare to see shows made with the same type of quality animation in todays world of 'mass produced' anime.

the opening ending music is outstanding also... i must have watched the full ending credits 100 times on youtube.

those 2 factors, plus it's over the top popularity are what made me get volume 1. but, actually watching the show, i was nothing but disapointed...

aside from episode 0, which is out of place (and boring if you ask me) the other 3 episodes on this disc didn't do well at all in convincing me to keep watching. i realise that it's "not in the correct order" as so many haruhi fans have already said, but honestly, if the revelation in episode 3/4 hadn't come then, i would have thought there was nothing to this show at all.

haruhi herself was my chief complaint. as main character i certainly didn't warm up to her at all. aside from stopping her from getting bored so she doesn't 'reset the world', i can't understand why anyone would want to be around her. her tactics for getting what she wants, her constant sexual abuse towards mikuru and the 0 character development for her in volume 1, left me not caring if she destroyed the world, i just wanted to get away from her.

so be fair warned, as this show may be overwhelmingly popular at the moment, but it certainly isn't for everyone.
