For the more artistic and existentialist type, this is a great watch.  If you don't know what that is, then watch it and you may find out. With Neil Young on soundtrack, Depp, the chemistry of Billy Bob and Iggy Pop appearing briefly in one scene (well worth the short time and hilarious), and a great list of other characters, one cannot miss it.  A very intriging film done with style and lots of atmosphere and aesthetics. I purchased this film, and I'm not likely to buy anything because I am so cheap, and I never tired of watching it. It's probably more of a guy film, so gals, you might want to skip this one unless you're a huge Depp fan. There's not much dialogue at times, which attracts me. It's a film that doesn't say much, but when it does, its sublime. A very surreal watch by all means. At times you wonder about what just happened, but just go with it. You can really get the feel of the wild West when watching this, but for anyone who lives out west and is experienced with the diverse terrain, you'll notice a few mistakes in the sequencing of landscapes. Still worth watching and buying due to it's uniqueness and aesthetics.
