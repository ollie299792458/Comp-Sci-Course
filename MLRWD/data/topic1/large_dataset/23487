Return To Oz came out when I was only 3 years old. One of my earliest memories is of seeing this in the theater. My sister and I would beg our parents to rent the video out through out the late '80s until somebody finally taped the movie for us. Yet, it was frustrating to me as a child that this movie didn't "go" with The Wizard of Oz. Where were the songs? Why was Dorothy younger? Why did Uncle Henry have a beard? Where did the farm hands go? And most importantly, why did the Scarecrow have "golf ball" eyes? I was well grown before I realised this movie isn't really a sequel to the 1939 film. The title may indicated that it's a sequel, but don't let that fool you. It's a film all on it's own. (In my eyes,  if it's to be called a sequel, it's to a film that was never made.) And the truth is, it's much more enjoyable when you aren't fretting that it doesn't go with the other film. Sure, there are those ruby slippers, but other than that this is based on the L. Frank Baum books (which I am a huge fan of.) As far as people saying that this is closer to the spirit of Baum's OZ, I wonder if they read the same books that I did. Yeah, there were no floating Glinda bubbles or the "it was all a dream" ending, but I fail to remember Oz being dark. I mean, it wasn't all sunshine and lollipop guilds, but it was never this gloomy. And like The Wizard of Oz, some things are lost in translation or added that weren't in the books. As neat and terrifying as that Nome King is, he is hardly what is described in the books, which is a short fat rock colored Santa Claus type. (And if that is Santa Claus, I sure as heck wouldn't want him coming down my chimney!) That aside, the makers of this film did try to make the characters look like the John R. Neill illustations. I would rank this as one of my favorite films.
