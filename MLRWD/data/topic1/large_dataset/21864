First, let me say that Halloween 4 is a great film, so this review isn't for the film itself.  This poor review is for the way this particular release was handled by Anchor Bay.  The fact that Anchor Bay had no problems telling us that the 30 minutes of missing footage was going to be added as a bonus feature and then telling us that wouldn't be the case right before the Blu Ray was scheduled to be released is not the right way to get your product into the consumers hands.  What is even worse is that Anchor Bay has not released a statement as to why this footage was not added to the release. For those of you who are under the impression that all the scenes shot have been released and that no other footage exists, I distinctly remember a scene where Rachel tells Kelly to "have some coffee" and then proceeds to pour the hot coffee down Kelly's "Cops Do It By The Book" shirt. In the theatre, Kelly goes down to the laundry room and changes her shirt. This is why, in the DVD releases Kelly has her cop shirt on when the coffee gets poured on her and then the next scene she is wearing the flannel shirt when she takes the tray out to the living room and finds Deputy Logan dead. This is just one example of footage that was shot that has not been included in any release to date.  Shame on you Anchor Bay- you can certainly do better than this and us loyal Halloween fans deserve better!!
