I have read Macbeth by Shakespeare before and I was amazed how effectively the film Throne of Blood interpreted Macbeth. Kurosawa Akira conveyed the atmosphere and the feeling of the original Macbeth successfully. I am Japanese who has lived in Japan all my life, so maybe that’s why, but I personally thought that the movie is unique and has been well developed with Japanese modes of expression. All the setting, characters, and language are in Japanese, such as old-Japanese castles, the samurai with swords and old the Japanese language that even now-days Japanese will suffer from understanding.
It is also interesting to see how Kurosawa interpret Macbeth differently from Shakespeare, especially at the end where Macbeth or Washizu dies. In Throne of Blood, Washizu is killed by the army on his side which makes it more dramatic, tragic, and striking. You can’t neglect this creative Japanese-style Macbeth which you will gain a lot of new ideas and thoughts. This movie might change your interpretation or understanding of Macbeth and you might feel differently from before. It will be a good opportunity to check this out and compare with other versions of Macbeth. I, myself felt it was worthwhile watching the movie Throne of Blood so I’m sure people can experience a different concept of Macbeth.
