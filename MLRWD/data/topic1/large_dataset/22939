I wavered between 3 and 4 stars on this film, but the caliber of the fight scenes almost pushes this movie to 5 stars.  It is no joke that Tony Jaa could be the next Bruce Lee/Gordon Liu, etc.... (whatever martial arts action star you think is great).  The end fighting scenes were so good that the movie would have been better if they simply cut out the rest.

Therein lies my only issue with this movie; if you have some great martial arts why not weave it together with a better story line.  Although not outright anti-Western, there are some troubling portrails of Westerners in this film.  Believe me, I am not naive and realize what goes on in Thailand (I have been there several times) and there is definitely some cultural significance to the movie's underlying theme... but it hurts the film more than it helps.  The movie then takes several predictable turns and emulates a Western style shoot 'em up, blow 'em up style.  I just hope the next movie involves more of Tony Jaa's talents rather than needless pyrotechnics. I just wanted the buyer to be aware of the rest of the movie (not that it matters that much) since the rest of the reviews focus (quite rightly) on the fighting.

While the acting wasn't top notch, it wasn't all that bad and doesn't kill the movie.

In conclusion, while the storyline is contrived and the plot a bit sophmoric, Tony Jaa is no joke and I am searching for more of his movies as I type.  All action and martial arts fans will be blown away by his ability and presence.
