Take the premise from a pulp Armageddon novelette, add good writing and excellent acting, and release the movie a couple of years after a nuclear stand-off for maximum audience impact.  It's a great cross between a naval action-adventure flick and an Alfred Hitchcock horror classic.

Aside from the great acting and pretty good cinematography, "The Bedford Incident" (1965) is notable for using a black actor, Sidney Poitier, in a role that didn't specifically call for it.  Indeed, the lack of even a hint of racial tension between Poitier's character, the ship's captain, the former Nazi advisor, or the crew suggests a missed opportunity.  On the other hand, I found it refreshing if not unrealistic to the story to see a black man cast as an American "every man" in a movie produced in the midst of the American civil rights movement.

Though I found the movie's premise weak, it plays delightfully on one's paranoid fears.  How can we be assured that our government or any government has placed the appropriate controls on its most destructive weapons?  Too many controls would neuter a military's effectiveness.  Too few controls might accidentally trigger a war.  And too much information released in order to reassure the public would also hand its enemies a significant advantage.  "The Bedford Incident" suggests to an audience already living under the Sword of Damocles that their situation may be worse than it appears.

This movie provides some food for thought in the areas of nuclear proliferation and control, organizational behavior, and psychology.  It also found it quite fun to watch.
