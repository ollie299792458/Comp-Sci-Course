This movie is marketed as a movie dealing with the racial issues of an Arab-American father and daughter during the Gulf War era in the United States, yet it does not. Apart from a 6 year old boy calling the girl towelhead and camel jockey there are no racial problems being dealt with. The whole story deals with a girl struggling to grow up amidst her parents divorce and each one living a selfish life.

What i hated about this movie is that it showed the predatory nature of men in a vicious way. the scenes were horrifying to watch and basically makes one fear being a girl or giving birth to one. The girl in the movie was prey to every male character, from the mother's boyfriend, to the perverted soldier neighbor, to her abusive father and even her sex crazed teenage boyfriend!

All this struggle and pain being experienced by this 13 year old girl is dealt with in solitude and ends with her smiling?! so the moral of the story is that if you are a girl all men will want to consume you and rape your innocence all the while you have to take it yet if you speak up then you will grow up and find yourself.

This movie was an excuse to show sick male fantasies portrayed under the veil of a coming-of-age story.
