In the tradition of the fair lady Celt drawn to the magic, music, generosity, romance and mysticism of the Arabian Nights, Kate Winslet and her daughters are burnished by their journey of hardship and shared with kindly in a way that Westerners will find fascinating if hard to understand.  The Koran demands charity especially to the traveller, from the believers.  The self sacrifice of the Moroccan man is typical of the kindness that takes so many Western women who are open to it aback.  We are used to fathers who talk of money as though we were worth less than it.  An Arabic view is quite different and a well spring of relief for a thirsty human being in need of true generosity and love.  By the way, the Celts originate in the area surrounding the Black Sea which is where the draw to the Middle East springs from in what might otherwise be taken for contrived little red haired Scottish girls who have no idea who they are or what they're doing.  Actually, they have a perfectly good idea and every right.  You will enjoy this journey with Kate.
