A review on the cover of the DVD likens this film to David Fincher's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003W8NM">Fight Club (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000640VO">Amelie</a>.  To some extent, this is a valid comparison, but He Was a Quiet Man fails to reach the brilliance of the other two films.

Bob (Christian Slater) is an office worker at the end of his tether who dreams of blokwing up his place of employment.  At home, he has no one to talk to but his goldfish, and one of them actually talks back -- mostly to berate Bob for his lack of initiative.  One day, as Bob is trying to talk himself into turning a gun on his co-workers, a fellow worker beats him to it.  But when the other man turns his gun on Vanessa, Bob's secret crush, Bob takes an action that changes both of their lives.

While the ending isn't particularly surprising, this film is worth watching for the performances alone, particularly Christian Slater's.  I'm used to Slater playing the wise-cracking self-assured hero, but he's very convincing here as the office loser with no redeeming qualities.
