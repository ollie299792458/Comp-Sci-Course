After seeing the first few minutes of Aftermath, I have to say that it is a beautiful and disturbing piece of work. The quality of the filming is very good and the lighting used was spot on.

Its a film that will stay in memory for a long time after after viewing and I am sure that many people will be sickened by the taboo subject matter of necrophillia.

It really does make you wonder about what goes on behind closed doors and I am pretty sure that all the people who work in morgues are a select breed who have their own reasons for doing such an unpleasant job. My one complaint about the film is that I felt that the bodies in the film looked very Rubbery and lightweight! theres one scene where one of the bodies is lifted and dropped onto the slab which looked very fake in my opinion, but I guess with the budget Mr Cerda had at the time he would have had the best he could afford!

All in all I loved the film and all the extra stuff that came on the disc was well done.
