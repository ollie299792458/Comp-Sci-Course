My father was a WWII Vet who suffered from PTSD, but never received help for it. He wasn't the Alcoholic, but he could, for no apparent reason become Violent. My mother was the Alcoholic, and she eventually died from the effects. My mom's father/my grandfather was my early in life salvation. He died when I was 17. My mom and dad divorced very shortly afterwards. Due to my mom's drinking he left his share of the home in my name which in turn made me the Head-of-the-Household and thus forced me to assume responsibilities that went along with that heading rather than exploring my own goals and desires. This feeling was imposed on me by my mom's mom, who was a controlling and enabling person. Over the years she sent my mom off to various treatment centers that would work for awhile. However the two of them had a love/hate relationship that always ended up with my mom's drinking again. I saw "Days of Wine and Roses" when it was first released and it still to this day lives within me. I felt hopeless to be able to do anything to get my mom to stop drinking and asked her to go see the movie. She did, and she was drunk before she got home from her viewing of it. After I had two failed marriages a woman friend of mine who worked in Family Services strongly suggested I consider joining ACOA, or Adult Children of Alcoholics. Very soon it will be 24 years since I've done so, and while I've done lots of work (it's like peeling through the layers of an Onion) I still discover some issues from time to time. Just like other 12 Step Programs were focus on the 12 Steps, Serenity Prayer, and Promises. I'd like to encourage one and all of you to strongly consider this program if you feel that my comments Mirror your life.
