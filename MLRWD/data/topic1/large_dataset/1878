"When you're sliding into first And your pants begin to burst. That's diarrhea, diarrhea.
When you're sliding into two And your pants are filled with goo. That's diarrhea, diarrhea.
When you're sliding into third And you feel a greasy turd. That's diarrhea, diarrhea.
When you're sliding into home And your pants are filled with foam. That's diarrhea, diarrhea."

That's just one of the funny little things that are in this movie.  My sisters and I both think of that song when thinking of the movie.  Steve Martin is of course funny as heck.  Keanu Reeves was adorable (my sister even shaved her hair like them).  Joaquin (Leaf) Phoenix was pretty cute.  Rick Moranis was both series and funny.  Diane West played a cool single mom. The all star cast list goes on.

This was the "new normal" family when the movie first came out. This movie came out in 1989.  I was born in 76, and I have a dad that let us watch the 'Lost Boys' at such a young age.  The barely 13 y.o. me remembers this movie as a funny comedy with some boring adult stuff.  And now I just think it's a classic example of what life was like as a family at that time era.

This is and always will be a great family classic.
