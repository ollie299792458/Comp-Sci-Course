A lot has already been said about the flaws of this movie, and I have to agree: Demie Moore is wooden (but then again, I never considered her a good actress, although I do think that she is a stunning natural beauty); Robert Redford just a tad too old (again - love the guy AND the acting, but still...), but above all, the plot has holes, the dialogue is flat and the characters lack dimension.
However, I'd like to come to the defense of two instances, which everyone agreed to hate:
1.  Woody Harrelson's role.  I do not think he was miscast.  Although he is definitely no match for Robert Redford looks-wise, I think he pulls off the role quite well.  Yes, he's not the perfect man that Robert Redford is, but then again, few men are...  And one does not need to be perfect to be loved.
The scene where he has the change of heart is quite touching, he is convincing throughout (the look he gives the tourist who jokes that his wife might not come back?!), and demonstrates enough emotions even without speaking to render the final scene poignant.
I also did not find his character lazy or whiny (recession, anyone?), nor do I remember him doing too much cursing...

2.  The hippo thing.  I thought it was one of the best things in the movie and one of its few redeeming features.  I loved the line, and I loved the logic behind it: the money gained frivolously could only be spent frivolously (and, in this case, also wonderfully symbolically) to find redemption and forgiveness.

I would definitely not go as far as to call this movie a classic, nor do I think that it's particularly mind-blowing (or immoral, for that matter), but it's an entertaining film, with some good chemistry and nice scenes.  Above all, it sets the mood rather well, and if you happen to be in a mood that matches, you'd enjoy the movie at least once.  As for owning it - I'd wait to watch it once first...
