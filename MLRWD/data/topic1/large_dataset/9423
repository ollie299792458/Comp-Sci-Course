To someone that gave it one star and would wonder how "the masses" think this movie is good: Since SO MANY people like this movie and YOU don't, did you ever stop to think that it may be YOU who is wrong on this one?

Look, I'll give you the fact that it's not a deep, meaningfull, piece of art. But if you go into watching it that way, then you've got the problem.

If you saw a preview, the ads make it perfectly clear: this is a movie where aliens come down and blow suff up. PERIOD. duh.

Yes, we don't really care about the characters (espescially the kid in the baseball cap - I think that character is a movie pre-requisite, even though it's so annoying). Yes, the story is simple and in many cases predictable. But you don't go on a roller coaster ride because the seats are comfortable.

Stuff blows up. Stuff blows up a lot. And it is good. It's pure mindless fun. If that's not "mature" enough for you, then you would bewrong to think that it would be. You don't turn on a rock and roll radio station hoping to hear Beethoven.

By the way, to all of those who are reading this: All the other reviews on this movie are POSITIVE. Except for that one guy. Just for the fun of it, go see all his other reviews. Guess what?!? He hates EVERYTHING! 7 out of 7 movies! He even goes so far as to give ID4 a bad review two different times! Plus, notice how all of the movies he reviews and doesn't like fall into the mindless fun thrillride catagory. Who would listen to a guy who hates these kinds of movies but takes the time to watch them and review them?!?

If MILLIONS of people around the world like this movie but one does not (and they don't like any movies of these kind), then they're the ones who don't get it.

Buy it. It's innexpensive here on Amazon. You'll enjoy it.
