Fleas that have been trained to kill? Evil twin sisters joinedat the hip? Menacing cyclops with green vision? A floating brain in atank...with a migraine? Six comical clones and the original who created them? An oil-rig domain protected by a tightly -packed minefield? Costumes by Jean-paul Gaultier? A little boy who is always eating? Krank - a man who can't dream so he steals dreams off of children? The most amazing artwork ever put to celluloid? oh....and the effects are fittingly perfect...
A person could want no more It is a film that will pull you in to it's weirdness and hold you like a dream.  You will feel that you have to watch it again just for the effect it has on you. 
HIGHLIGHT: MIETTE is being strangled by ONE, as she cries a tear flies from her face and causes a chain of events that result in the electricity of the town being cut off thus disabling the lighthouse which in turn sees a huge cargo ship crash into the harbour and comes to a stop inches from the twin sisters who are watching the events...A tear saves MIETTE
GREAT FILM.  END
