I knocked a star off the rating of this classic film because the quickie flip to DVD.  I also have an old VHS copy(1984)where there's a moth(!)fluttering across the screen for several seconds. Some of it was cleaned up for this "Special Edition" DVD, but the editors obviously were dozing or had to get said product to market so you still inexplicitably see it fluttering around on the DVD version.

Honestly, they were probably too lazy to get the orignal masters from the vault & just transfered the VHS version through the computer cleaning up a few dropouts, but not really taking the time to release a professional standard.

That being said, the extra features are essential for film geeks.  James Lipton gets almost teary-eyed talking about Brando's artistic choices & the famous scene in the cab has a great backstory.

Maybe a "definitive" version of this release is still a few years away.  Perhaps there's an even better version in pre-production for HD DVD or Blu-ray. Until then, there's tons of VHS copies floating around for cheap or classic movie weekends on cable.

If rating this movie on its power as a story, then it's five star hands down. This is what Brando was capable of before becoming a victim of his own ego. The priest character played by Karl Malden is anything but preachy.  He drinks & smokes w/the dockworkers & even throws a punch. Even though some reviewers on this forum don't get it, this is perhaps one of the best examples of the paschal mystery ever caught on film.
