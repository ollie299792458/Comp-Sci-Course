Almost every time I mention The Truman Show as a favorite movie I endure stares of confusion followed by statements such as "how could you have LIKED this? It wasn't even FUNNY!"

Of course it wasn't funny! This is nearly the DARKEST, most paranoia-inducing concept I can imagine for a film. Truman's wife, his best friend, and the Almighty-like Christof are diabolical, cash-driven thieves of a good heart and gentle soul. They will stop at nothing to keep Truman in their sick version of "REAL".

Sure, Carrey does manage to pull a couple of wry laughs-which are truly profound statements of his growing disgust with his created world. We laugh, even as we're crying as Truman learns of the nature of his life for thirty years.

Jim Carrey is brilliant in this largely-overlooked film, and those of us who looked beyond his capabilities as Fire Marshal Bill certainly realize this. There is no one else who could have portrayed Truman Burbank so perfectly.

The musical score is also tremendous. It wrings every intended emotion out of the audience.

Was nothing real? Jim Carrey WAS real. This is a triumphant movie. I remain in stunned disbelief this film was overlooked for Oscar nomination. This movie continually fights with Shawshank for the Number One rank on my favorites list.
