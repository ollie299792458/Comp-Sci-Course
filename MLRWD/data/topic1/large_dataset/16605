This is an absolutely timeless classic.  It does have its faults... as do many of the films from this era (racial issues abound in movies from this time period, i.e. a younger woman referring to an older black man as "boy") but don't think for a moment I don't love the story.  As someone who began life many decades after this film was created, I have to wonder which, if any, of our generation's movies will even come close to the classic feel or lasting appeal of "Casablanca."  Is anyone going to care about any of the current crop of movies 60 years from now?  Most of what I see being released currently just feels more and more superficial and disposable.  I'm also able to recognize that old films such as "Casablanca" do have a limited appeal nowadays.  One wouldn't necessarily call it action packed.  Comparatively speaking, most sets here are basic, special effects are non-existent, everything revolves around creating the relationships between the characters... the focus is on dialog, supporting pathos and ethos.  Most people my age wouldn't find this entertaining.  But please, watch this movie, and for a moment try to picture a classier, more idealistic world, separate from the continuous dumbing down of popular culture. I enjoy watching old movies, and this is among the best.
