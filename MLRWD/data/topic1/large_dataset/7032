I only got this movie 3 days ago and I am already on the seventh viewing. I just love romantic movies with a happy ending. Although sex is the buzzword these days for most things, this film is notable for its absence as are most other things you might expect to find in a romantic movie.
So what is the attraction ? Well firstly two first class actors. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. The storyline is such that they keep "missing" each other but getting occasional glimpses of one another. All the time I was willing them to meet even though it might shorten the movie. Without Jonah (Ross Malinger), Hanks' son, the movie would be doomed to failure since Hanks is no lady pursuer, but Jonah, helped by his little girlfriend mini travel agent make sure of success.  This is supposed to be a chick's movie, but as a "guy"  I just loved it.  My guess is you will want to buy "An Affair to Remember" too to get a fuller picture.  I just love movies with subtle little interesting things in them you miss first time round.
If you are looking for reality, this movie is not for you but if you want a lovely story with a happy ending it is lovely. Anybody whose marriage has been "magic" will identify with this film.
