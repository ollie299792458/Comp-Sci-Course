A large group of friends and I went to see this movie tonight, and I was pleasantly surprised. One thing that detracts from this movie is the fact that it wasn't really as funny as I thought it would be. However, the spotlight of this movie is the heated discussions within the barbershop, between Cedric the Entertainer, Seann Patrick Thomas, Checker Freddy, and the White Barber. 
We all know the plot by now, so I'll just say that while the subplot of the stolen ATM machine is pretty hysterical (and it does, in fact, serve a purpose) what I remember most is the different characters. This movie gives depth and dimension to a whole host of characters in a short amount of time, and I find that very impressive. There's the hothead unlucky-in-love Eve who is always going back to her nogoodnik lyin' cheatin' no-good scoundrel of a boyfriend, Checker Freddy, who's in cahoots with the infamous Eddie, played by Cedric the Entertainer. Ricky (I'm not sure of the actor's name but he is FINE, ladies, SO HOT) is a very interesting character, with a shady past, but a heart of gold. Seann Patrick Thomas plays a collegiate with a superiority complex. However, the character that steals my heart is the White Rapper. He's such a good character deep down that you'd love him if he was in FuBu and a dorag or a pinstripe suit with fedora. The final showdown between him and SPT (hee hee hee) is very gratifying.
It makes me happy to see a movie that portrays black people as a mature, well-informed and intelligent group of people. Characters are not looked down on, and they bring up very important issues in this movie. In the end, I felt very happy I'd gone to see this movie.
All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone. This movie is a joy to watch!
