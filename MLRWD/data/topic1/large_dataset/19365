I got this movie for a my niece and nephew for a steal, so if it stunk up the place, what's the harm? -- the first two times I watched it, I fell asleep, I don't know why... I just couldn't keep my eyes open -- the first time the kiddies watched it, they lost interest a third of the way through and made my little nap break a nightmare -- but ya know, we stuck with Horton and the Whos'-- and I have to say this movie has grown on all of us and I rather like it... Now, the babies are glued to the TV and on every viewing I like this movie more and more ... my favorite part being when Vlad(not the bunny, with the cookies:) takes the clover and we see Horton in an old spaghetti western influenced type scene... wow, that's great stuff, with the screaming trumpet and stuff!  As well as... the end, when the Who's work together to save their world.

This one definitely ranks high on my list... great for kids and adults... there isn't much if any of that adult humor crud(i.e. Madagascar), which I mostly find inappropriate for young audiences even if they don't 'get it' yet... and though it isn't to the level of Pixar, I think they did a great job with this one...
