I have to second (or third?) the prior review by Bowers.  I love Denise Austin, and own yoga/Pilates videos by her which I found to be great.  However, trying this one out, I felt like I needed to just *watch* several times in order to know what I was supposed to be doing.  There were a few times where I thought I was supposed to hold a position, and looked up to see that she was doing other movements while babbling encouraging words.  I'd rather be told what to do, thank you.  There were also times where she spoke as if her audience were yoga pros and knew what was meant when she gave the names of poses.  Some of them (e.g. pigeon) I was only vaguely familiar with.  She doesn't give you a lot of time to get into position, either.  I know the workouts are short, but I'd rather "waste" a few seconds understanding how to get into position than waste several minutes while she does the exercise and I'm left clueless.  Or she could have added an instructional section so that you can learn the poses independently of doing a workout.  Also, I think there were only a couple of exercises in the Ab section that actually hit the abs.  I like that the workouts are short and can be combined however you like, but 10 Minute Solution does that a LOT better.  I also think it's nice that there is a music-only option, which is extra nice given the lack of good instruction.  Nonetheless, my copy of this DVD is getting sold.
