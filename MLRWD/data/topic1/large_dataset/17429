Ok, do yourself a favor and read the book. Now you can watch the movie! And you find out, after reading the book, that the movie is horrible.  Ok, do yourself a favor: Don't read the book, because books are often a lot  better/different than movies. So, just go RENT (I could not stress the word  rent anymore) it and watch it. It's also terrible. The way I see it: you  can't get to like this movie. If you want to see it just because you've  read the book, rent it, although believe me, it's a BIG let-down. Or if  you're just looking for a good action-adventure, Jarrasic Park-style movie:  don't look anywhere near this.  The gorrila is absolutely the most annoying  thing that has ever graced the Silver Screen. (Yes, even surpassing  good,old Jar Jar!) The acting is bad. The special affects are bad. (Plus,  there wasn't any reason to put them in the movie, but someone thought it'd  be a good idea... shame on that person.) There is a lazer gun that can  shoot satellites &amp; looks oddly like bad sci-fi. A big let-down, and  pretty much a waste of time. Unless, of course, you're the director of this  movie, and want me to be in one of yours: in which case, I found the movie  very good and enlightening!
