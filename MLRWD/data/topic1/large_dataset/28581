sometimes you get Nashville and sometimes you get Paris, an overly stuffed, overly long and still inchoate piece of work.  We should all be as prettily perhaps dying as Romain Duris, a professional dancer who is told one day that his heart is going and he will need a transplant.  What he does then is mope around his lovely Paris apartment, which seems to overlook a cemetery, babysit his semi-estranged sister's three kids when she (Juliette Binoche) moves in to take care of him, and observe the comings and goings of his neighborhood.  He develops a crush on the student across the way who is being stalked by text messages from her professor.  And so it goes -- the professor has a damaged relationship with his brother, the vegetable man where Binoche does her daily shopping still loves his ex-wife, etc., etc.  The best scene is when the smarmy professor dances to Wilson Pickett's Land of a Thousand Dances, and it is the song, not the dance that makes that scene.  There's lots more, most of it scarcely worth a second glance, until the final scene of Pierre's taxi ride to his transplant appointment when director Klapisch appears to suddenly realize he hasn't shown us enough of The Eternal City so under the pretext of demonstrations throughout Paris necessitating a roundabout route to the hospital, the ride becomes a Paris-lover's dream with many long loving shots of its boulevards and monuments, and of course the obligatory glances at some of the characters whose lives have glanced off Pierre's.  Two hours is a long time to wait for that ride, way too long for me.
