A ghost story unlike any other. Director Alejandro Amenabar's The Others is one of those far too rare jewels of the genre.  With a strong plot, memorable characters, haunting atmosphere and more layers than one can uncover in a couple of viewings, this film is a masterpiece of film-making.

Unlike the vast majority of horror films out there that have to rely on slash fests, vulgarity, nudity and buckets of blood to try to smokescreen for weak plots of less than mediocre and forgetful films, The Others, is on that short list category with films like Jack Clayton's The Innocents, from the 1961 which was based on a Henry James story, Robert Wize's The Haunting, from 1963, adapted from Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining adapted from Steven King's masterpiece novel in 1980.
