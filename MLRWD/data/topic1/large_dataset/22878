On the surface, "Cat People" is an entertaining and suspenseful film about a guy who marries an odd woman (played by Simone Simon) who can't consummate their marriage because of an awful spell.  But beneath that surface is a curious subtext.

Consider a pivotal scene when Simone is at a restaurant with her husband and others.  Our heroine is confronted by a fellow cat person.  This strange woman knows a "sister" when she sees one - "one of her own kind."  (You could say Simone gives off a lesbian vibe, or that the stranger has gaydar.)  This stranger tells Simone to accept her true nature - in essence, outing her in front of the others.  She tells Simone to leave her life with her husband - her hetero life one could argue - behind.  Up to this point, Simone has thought she is different from others, and this further confirms it.  She comes to believe that she is connected to a group of woman - a sisterhood if you will - unlike other people.  Is it any wonder Simone can't consummate her marriage?

"Cat People" plays like the story of a confused lesbian living in the homosexually repressed 1940s.
