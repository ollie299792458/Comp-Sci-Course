I'll say it up-front. Personally, I'm not a fan. If you want true Seuss-y enjoyment, you can get a copy of the original How The Grinch Stole Christmas! (with the exclamation-point) on DVD (with extras) and it includes the almost as great Horton Hears A Who, both of which had the direct-input and approval of Dr. Seuss.

Screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (and, I'm certain, an uncredited squad of fixers and hacks) added an unnecessary back-story to the Grinch in an attempt to give the miserable SOB "motive" and to make him, for some reason, more sympathetic. They give him a public-humiliation in grade school, something with which any viewer can relate, but even in that they hedge their bets, making him a vicious little monster as an infant as if they simply can't decide how they want to present his character. Is he naturally cruel, or the creation of his tormenting classmates? Most bewilderingly perhaps is that the Whos, previously so pure and joyful in their observation of Christmas, are turned into petty, greedy, consumption-obsessed nitwits, many with less-than-noble ulterior motives. Carey and Howard pack everything they can into the film in order to make Hollywood Holiday Blockbuster Magic and, in that at least, they succeeded, garnering a worldwide gross at the time of this writing of over $345 million, but where is the joy? The action is frenetic, Carey is manic, the cute and funny dog is cute and funny in all the right places, and the comedy is in turn satirical and slapstick. Somewhere in there, a holiday about love and selflessness gets lost.

Art direction, it should be said, was delightful. The sets and costumes, hair and makeup, are all very well-executed eye-candy, and have a definite true Seuss look. They got that much right at least. But then, they had Theodore "Dr. Seuss" Geisel's wonderful drawings to use as a blueprint. If only they had kept true to the spirit of his story as well.
