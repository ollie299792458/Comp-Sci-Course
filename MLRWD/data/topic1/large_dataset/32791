I bought the entire set (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009GX1C4">The Complete Thin Man Collection</a>) to get this, my perennial favorite, before it was released individually. What W.S. Van Dyke did so well in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009ZE9N0">The Thin Man</a>, he topped and delivered even more of in this superb sequel. Even more affectionate banter between Nick and Nora, even more harebrained, screwy upper crusters, more action scenes, and the usual mob of colorful bottom dwellers from Nick's former life as a "flat foot." Throw in a couple of full-scale musical numbers and you've the recipe for a flick that should please everyone. Everything about this film is better, including the photography, the sets, dialogue, plot complications, location shooting (including a surprise that always gets San Francisco natives chuckling; watch for the semi-completed Golden Gate Bridge seen from Coit Tower Plaza as the Charles' arrive at their "home"). And Jimmy Stewart. Yep, Jimmy Stewart. Has no one mentioned a very, very young James Stewart in a supporting role? His charisma and talent are apparent even in this thankless part. You might also recognize Dorothy McNulty's voice as the nightclub singer ... later (as Penny Singleton) she was the voice of Jane Jetson.

The product number of this individual release is different from the version in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009GX1C4">collection</a>, so I can only assume that the extras are lacking here: a Robert Benchley short ("How To Be a Detective"), cartoon ("The Early Bird and the Worm"), a radio show with Powell and Loy, theatrical trailer, and an MGM promotional short. If you'd like those extras, go ahead, get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009GX1C4">the entire set</a>. THE THIN MAN, ANOTHER THIN MAN, and SHADOW OF THE THIN MAN are all entertaining in the same vein, though I think AFTER THE THIN MAN truly stands out.
