From 10 Things I hate about you to Save the Last Dance, Julia Stiles never seems to disappoint. Her co-star Sean Patrick Thomas can also be credited for his role in Cruel Intentions. Stiles brings her a sense of reality to the movie and you can really begin to relate to her character and the things happening around her. 
Sara (Julia Stiles) is left in the not so pretty side of Chicago with her father Roy. Her mother had just died trying to get to her big audition for Julliard. The movie opens on a train, and Sara remembering the time before the train ride. She lives in an apartment with her jazz playing father, and the two don't really get along. In school she meets up with a girl named Chenille and they become instant friends. Chenielle asks Sara to join them in going to a local club named Steppes. 
Stiles isn't used to the Hip Hop ways of dance, but Chenielle's brother Derek (Thomas) is quick to ask her to dance. Sara has to get used to the music, but before she can she makes a fool of herself. Derek asks her if she wants to get together some time and work on her moves. They get together and soon Thomas and Stiles are heating up the dance floor.  All through the movie you see the tuffness the couples endure and the "predjiduce" that seemed to go along with it. Derek helps Sara realize her dreams and then in the end helps her complete her dreams. 
This is a must see movie for ages 13 and up, and an absolute great date movie. So see it and enjoy!
