For those who have not seen this movie, be parepared for a plot twist. That warning is needed because many of those who have written about this movie see a woman in the contemporary world dealing with surivor guilt. Before you hold too tightly to that proposition, consider the title of the movie.

My advice is this: focus on the bathroom scene dialog that takes place in bits and pieces throughout the film, horrifying as it might be. The killer sets the rules -- one of the two girls will die. Pay attention to the one who volunteers first and look at her motives. Watch the affect of that decision on the other girl (our heroine) and watch her work through the possible outcomes. Who will have the better life if allowed to live? Then understand her plea to the gunman.

I enjoy a movie with plot twists, which is why I give Sixth Sense high marks. The plot twist there is thrilling and easy to figure out. But the plot twist here is just as thrilling -- I'd just hate to see anybody miss it, as so many have.
