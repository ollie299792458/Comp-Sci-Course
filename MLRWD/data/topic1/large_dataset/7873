Can someone help me out here.  I have always been an avid fan of Mel Brooks' original 1968 film, "The Producers".  I had it on VHS in the fullscreen version and I also have the 2003 widescreen DVD version with aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  However, when comparing these two versions, I notice that the widescreen version is nothing more than the fullscreen version with the top and bottom chopped off.  Now I am considering buying the 2005 Deluxe Edition, but I would like to know whether it is wide or full.  The product description says that the aspect ratio is 1.33:1, but it also lists it as being both widescreen and fullscreen.  I usually prefer widescreen, but not if the top and bottom are chopped off to create a widescreen effect.  Does anyone know how this film was originally released in the theater.  If it was originally released in fullscreen then that is the format that I would prefer to have.  If it was originally released in widescreen, then does a version exist which is authentically widescreen or is there only the version with the top and bottom chopped off.  After comparing the two versions, the chopped version seems to be a bit crowded.  To complicate matters even more, I notice that the 2002 Special Edition DVD is listed with an aspect ratio of 1.66:1.  Any help would be greatly apprciated.
