All right now, this movie has gotten a lot of bad reviews. With good reason some say, I'm not one of these. Let me start by saying this: The movie is a campy crossover style tale that throws Dracula, the Wolfman, Frankenstien's monster, and several other notable horror creatures together for about two hours of CGI action. Stop. Read that again. Now consider this: What kind of plot, characterizations, and entertainment factor is something like this going to provide?

If you are expecting some sort of masterpiece, a triumph in action filming... This movie just isn't for you. If you are looking for a movie with a solid, sensical plot... This movie isn't really for you. Because honestly, when Frankenstien's monster is the key to some evil plot schemed by Dracula, can you really expect all that much?

However! I'd like to state that if you are just a horror loving person that's not afraid to operate under the "it doesn't have to make sense" rule... If you get excited at the mere mention of vampires or werewolves... If you just love hours of top notch special effects with a plot you don't have to think about to have fun with... Then this is the movie for you.

So yes, while the hard core, Bram Stoker's Dracula loving, film reviewer in me weeps at such a horrible mush of cliches and over-the-top acting... The part of me that is compelled to watch the SciFi Channel's weekend "originals" drools at the thought of being able to sit down for a fun movie featuring some of my favorite monsters duking it out.
