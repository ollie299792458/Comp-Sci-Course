Obsessive love, all consuming love, love that is blind...all that is possible, even magical, if the lovers live in their own island of reality, isolated by illness and self-rejection (Binoche), by being a social cripple  (Daniel), and joined by need. The beautiful artist running away from her  increasing blindness illuminates the tortured soul of the fire-breather  street urchin. He discovers caring and gentleness as he takes care of her.  Their mutual dependency blossoms into a miraculously beautiful passion  which lasts only till a cure for her illness comes along. Fear of loss  drives him to extremes. They reunite when he comes out and she is cured and  in society again. Or do they reunite only in death as all tragic lovers in  history have been doomed to? The movie reaches for universal depth, but  loses it in falling prey to gauche excesses of visual  scintillation...gorgeous fireworks over Pont Neuf, but irritatingly out of  synch with the point of the movie. Binoche brings her beauty and sparkle to  this role, but it is Daniel who truly pulls at you, building sympathy and  throwing it away moments later, the way those who cannot help themselves  always seem to do.
