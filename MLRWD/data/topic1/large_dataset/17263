When individuals rate or review movies, books, dvds, music cds,

etc. the tendency is to be a little biased based on who or what

is involved in that particular stream of entertainment media.

Of course, not all the time, I myself have come across some

huge disappointments.  However, I will say it just like so many

other reviewers would say it about their particular character,

 song, or movie, "this is a must for any and all fans of the show

Everybody Loves Raymond!"  If you enjoy decent comedy writing,

excellent character portrayal by the actors and actresses and

possibly even being able to relate to some of the incidents and

family dysfunction the Barones' seem to encounter then this dvd

is for you.  I have seen these episodes over and over through

sydication and I don't tire from watching them.  So having the

opportunity to own them on dvd to view for years to come is a

great feeling.  This show just improves as time goes on.  Season

one is good, season two is better, three will be better than two

and so on.  You get the idea.  Don't hesitate, it's worth the $$

as opposed to trying to tape it with all those commercials.

Funny stuff.  I highly recommend.
