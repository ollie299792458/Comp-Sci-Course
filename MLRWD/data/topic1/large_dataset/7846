You start with a great script, assemble a top cast, a good  cinematographer, a reasonable budget, and what possibly could go wrong?  Well, it all goes wrong after the picture is filmed.  It goes to the  editing department.  A musical score is plugged in that makes you wince  with pain--it takes the beautiful "Poor Wandering One" by Gilbert  &amp; Sullivan and plays it lugubriously over the opening credits, getting  one of the notes wrong and one of the important chords wrong.  Thus,  instead of a bittersweet tune (which the adapter may have wanted), it turns  into a sophomoric howler.  But that's just for starters.  What really goes  wrong in the editing process is that the editor was out to lunch.  No  sensitivity for pacing.  The movie plods along.  The editor killed it,  stuffing it with scenes that take too long and characterizations that were  obvious minutes ago--as if the stupid audience needs more time to let it  all "sink in."  What a waste of Hollywood creativity!  Maybe the  editor fought with the director, and maybe it was really the director's  fault, though I personally believe that the person who has final cut is the  most important person in most movies, and here the final cut was an  abomination.  This might be one of those rare films that work better on TV  with commercial breaks.  The commercials would dull your sensibilities, and  you can pick up with the film afterwards, and settle into it at the languid  pace the editor chose.  But on DVD, which is how I just viewed it, it's a  movie that shoots itself in the foot.  Every element that was necessary for  an outstanding movie was there, but it was ruined after the actors and  directors and camerapersons went home.  Nevertheless, with all of the  post-production mediocrity, we still have a very fine screenplay, fine  acting, and an entertaining movie. Bottom line: if you don't mind that it  could have been much much better, what you'll see is pretty good.
