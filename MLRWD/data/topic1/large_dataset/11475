I loved Tom Hanks- he is a superior actor and met the challenges of this role- look at his physical changes alone- just for this movie.  Who else could carry that much time alone on the screen with nothing to talk to but a volleyball- put in for that very reason.  I enjoyed watching the interpretation of the challenges he would face on a deserted island and how he survived.  I was a little disappointed with how they brought him back- there was such a struggle to survive- only to be shoved in a hotel room with seafood on the table, loved that irony.  I did not like what happens with Hunt's char. Kelly and Hanks' char. upon his return.  I felt that if I had been in Kelly's position I would have fought harder to be with the man that she called 'the love of her life.'  I don't just want a 'feel good' ending but I am not sure that they made the right call with that relationship.  I know that if I had the oppurtunity to be with the love of my life after thinking he was dead I would have wanted nothing more than to be with him and everything else would have worked out around that.  But then again- she is a mom... So much for coming home- only to be alone again.  He had to face the challenge of re-entering society and after 4 years alone that is also difficult, I liked the scenes where they showed him readjusting to life with 'conviences.'  I still think that overall it is an excellent film- one which everyone should watch!  Makes you think about how much we have and how lucky we are to be alive- and how quickly that can all change and never be the same again!DON'T TAKE LIFE FOR GRANTED- NOT ONE SECOND!  DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON TIME!
