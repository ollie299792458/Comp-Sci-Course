If you can only view or own a handful of "film noir" movies,
this is the one you must have.  The story is now well-known and
most movie buffs have seen a copy, but the copies heretofore
available have been so poor, the technical shortcomings almost
made viewing a chore, so it was frequently by-passed.
All previous prints, available in the US, were full of visible
flaws, and, to make matters worse, all US prints had been edited
(mainly by having several scenes shortened, along with a different introduction) so they detracted from the original movie and the vision that produced it.
This new re-mastered DVD version is so sharp, the black and
white seems at times to have a razor-sharp quality, and many of its scenes literally jump out at the viewer, so the improved viewing quality is so pronounced, it may not seem like the same
movie.  This restoration could stand as the hallmark of the
point of restorations.
In addition, the British introduction, which is much better and
a little more full, as well as other previously-shortened scenes, have been restored, adding to the enjoyment of this classic.
A fabulous film, now available in an equally fabulous version,
and serious fans need to rush and get a copy of this newly restored version.
