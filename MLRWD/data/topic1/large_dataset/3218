An entertaining movie meant to be seen on the big screen. I think the original theatrical release was in "Cinerama", a gimmicky three screens wide, super wide (105mm?) film format which joined three regular 35mm films side by side and only shown in special theaters. I remember going to the Hollywood theater in Portland, Oregon to see this movie(I think)in Cinerama. Also the sound in that theater was spectacular as well. What an event!

To get back to the film review...I think the first cut of the movie on vhs was the best and it was still too long. The long discussion at the side of the road by the main group of characters prior to the movie really getting rolling was about 5 minutes longer than it needed to be. The obnoxious bachelor son (Ethel Merman's) routine could have been trimmed by a number of scenes. The end of the movie when people are flung through the air are over-the-top even for that era. Sid Caesar in the hardware store basement could use some trimming as well. Anyway it is corny and fun and worth an occasional viewing. The gas station demolition is priceless!

Also it is worth noting that approximately half the run time of the movie is devoted to (1960's) state of the art stunt work.
