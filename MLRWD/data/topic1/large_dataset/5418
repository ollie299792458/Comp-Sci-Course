I have just watched this Region 1 DVD two days ago, it had so much extra things that you can't enjoy in the normal cinema.  The view is superb!  The Director Commentary was excellent, he told you how exactly the whole movie was made in each scenes, very interesting to hear him tell you how he filmed it, and the honost review of some historical facts of this movie, and some funny incidents too, such as Jodie slipped down in one part. He also mentioned a lot of Jodie Foster's contribution to this movie. 
Get to see the interviews of Jodie and Chow Yun-Fat, the two amasing stars of this movie. The special introduction to production and custome design, where the Oscar Nominated actually did justified on the two most important extra element of this movie.  
The deleted scenes were wonderful to watch, anyway, I think Jodie Fans would be interested to watch for the first time Jodie acted an old age lady.  Chow Yun-Fat fans would love to watch more of the charming king.
For those who do not want to listen to the Thai, only in this DVD Region 1 collection, you have a choice to select only English to view the movie.  Watch out on the DVD you get, in other regions DVD of this movie did not have all the extra features that I had mention, nor any of the pirated DVD would have that extra features too.  Get the Region 1 "Anna and the King" DVD for your collection.
