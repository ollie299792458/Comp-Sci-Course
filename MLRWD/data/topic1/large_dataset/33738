Ewwwwwwwwwww...Yuccckkkkk..I cant believe I actually bought this product based on the reviews it received on TV - recently there was a TV program about movie glorification of gangster lifestyles and they highly praised this movie and they also mentioned this is the original the movie "Payback" is based on. Then I came here to amazon to read reviews and found some people had posted favorable reviews. Based on that I spent money on this movie. But this movie is a sheer waste of time!!! And precious money!!! DONT go for this movie!! DONT be impressed with the antiquity of this movie!! I cant decide if this movie is worse than that French production "Dog Day" starring Lee Marvin as well. I had seen "Dog Day" on the big screen back in India, decades ago, and had almost puked on my neighbor in the theater. This movie seems to be a glorified American version of that SERIOUSLY BAD French movie. If you love Hollywood crime thriller antiques then go for "THE GETAWAY", "THE FRENCH CONNECTION", "BULLITT", and "THE SEVEN-UPS".
