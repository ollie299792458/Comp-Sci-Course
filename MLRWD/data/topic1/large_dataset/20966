One of the tricks they used in the original "Alien" was that you barely saw the alien on camera, just a glimpse of a tail or part of the head.  You are always anticipating the creature and thus are always a bit on edge.  This same idea is employed in "The Haunting" to an even greater degree.  You never see the ghosts at all in this movie, so your imagination makes them more terrible than anything special effects could produce.  The original "Thirteen Ghosts" is a good example of showing too much in the way of bad special effects--the end result being cheesy not scary.  Getting back to "The Haunting", the direction of Robert Wise is very effective in setting the mood, but what really sells it is the performance of Julie Harris.  All the actors are fine here, particularly the Claire Bloom's enigmatic take on her role, but Julie Harris as Eleanor is one of the great combinations of actor and role in cinema history.  Just as Robert Shaw becomes Quint in "Jaws", Harris inhabits her part seemlessly.  Her fear and confusion are so tangible that the viewer cannot help but be chilled.  If you watch the haunting waiting for something to jump out and yell "boo", there's very little of that here.  The fear is all in Eleanor's mind--whether the ghosts are real or not--they are very real to her and to us as well.
