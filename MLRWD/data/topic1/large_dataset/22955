"Hoosiers" is a heartwarming, inspirational film based on the true story of an Indiana high school basketball team that made it all the way to the state finals.

The scenery reminds me of home, seems like it could have been filmed opposite my front yard.  The characters are great--Gene Hackman as the hard-headed, disciplined coach somewhat in the Bobby Knight mould.  Dennis Hopper as the town drunk who gets a second chance at respect. (Since Hopper was a contemporary of James Dean, I've often wondered if Dean would have starred in this film had he lived).  Barbara Hershey is great as the schoolteacher who gives Hackman the cold shoulder, while secretly admiring him inside and falling for him in the end.  "Jimmy Chitwood" is superb as the laconic basketball prodigy.

"Hoosiers" depicts small town life in Indiana pretty accurately.  What most Indiana towns lack in cosmopolitanism they make up for in friendly, hard-working, faithful, decent folk.  Except there's a part in the movie where Barbara Hershey says something like, "part of small town life is that folks' private affairs stay pretty much their own."  She's obviously never lived in a small town!

Basketball is like a religion in Indiana, so it's no wonder this story made it to the big screen.  I think it's one of the best sports films of all time, along with "Breaking Away," another Indiana film that was filmed at Indiana University in Bloomington, down south, and "Rudy," about Notre Dame football.

"Hoosiers" is a classically American tale; the humble underdog that triumphs through hard work and discipline.
