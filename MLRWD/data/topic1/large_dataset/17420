Dream Theater are an awesome group of musicians.  The sustaining energy through their performances is incredible!  I happened to be fortunate to have seen this concert from about 35 feet, dead center of the stage.  At first I was surprised to realize that they were going to play "Metropolis" from start to finish, and that they did.  Boy, did they!  As a fan since "Images and Words" I am thankful that someone picked up where the original progressive rockers like Yes, ELP, Rush, Kansas, etc. left off - and added a little testerone!  Watching these guys play is quite an experience.  Having the video to get a close-up look at their muscianship is a special treat.  As the music flowed from one track to the next, I was captivated by the performance.  However, there are a bit too many visual effects in the video where there may have been a better opportunity to feature the band, especially during a few "solo" interludes.  Sorry Mike.  Even so, after watching the video twice in three days, I must say that this a keeper!  I can only imagine the DVD!  The major drawback of the VHS is that the rest of the show is absent.  I don't know if it's on the DVD, but it's a shame that people can't see the balance of this amazing performance.  To see these guys just keep playing song after song for 4 hours was a sight to be seen.  Fortunately, I did, and reside myself to have been enriched by this event, however hot, smokey and smelly the club was.  I anxiously await their next offering.
