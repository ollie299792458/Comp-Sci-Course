The movie, no doubt, is a great piece of work.  I first watched the movie as a young boy and was caught up in the action immediately.  My ONLY criticism of the film is the complete lack of reference to the Canadian beach, Juno.  When Sean Connery, who played a Canadian with a bad accent, came to shore, he was greeted by a Frenchman drinking champaign, a fact that does not take into account the battle as it happened. Though a member of the Commonwealth, Canada took the beach as a sovereign army - not mere colonial forces.  Though Canada only had a population of approx. 11 million, it put more people in uniform per capita than any other nation - including Russia. The million Canadians that finally served in WWII (1939-45) earned the right to have their own beach and were the only allied nation to attempt a landing prior (Dieppe 1942).
Though this has strayed from the movie review, I believe that the movie is indicative of the WWII genre that forgets that it was a World War with many players, not just the one that are depicted on the silver screen. Nonetheless, great entertainment and highly enjoyable dispite the historical gaff.
