Day after Tomorrow is officially the WORST film ever. The CGI is spectacular, can't take that away from the film, but thats about it. Crappy stories about some guy walking across america in only 7 days in blizzards and other stories about wolves on an ocean liner in the middle of manhatten. Heres my question. The wolves escaped through a wall that was busted open by a flood. Water that strong smashed though the wall but the wolves somehow survive. They roam around manhatten unchecked until a  wall of water 1000feet high slams into the city, wiping out virtually everything, yet amazingly the wolves still survive. Better yet, the water freezes in about 24 hours. Its that cold that the whole damn OCEAN FREEZES over in only 24 hours, but STILL the wolves survive. Are they related to superman??????? And can i just say, wasn't it thoroughly convienient that when the cold air was coming down and the father had to jump into that building with his friend, he found himself surrounded by huge spiderburners, boilers, heaters and generators that were amazingly unaffected by powerloss of any kind. To light these things, you need a spark to ignite the gas. Incredibly, the gas lines were still working, even though they were frozen solid, also the electic cables were intact, even though they had been totally soaked and then frozen solid. Its a miracle. I could quite easily list 15 more similar events in the film that work along those lines but really it isn't worth my time. I mean, obviously some license is allowed to the director. He created an ice age in 6 days, i think thats enough license. He could have at least made a halfassed job of making it believable. (...) I'm done with my rant now. Anyone considering to go and see it... Don't. Do yourself a favour, read a book instead. Or watch grass grow, or paint dry. Anything is better than sitting through 124minutes of painfully corny lines, pathetic cliches, rediculous cliches and officially the worst storyline since Gigli.
