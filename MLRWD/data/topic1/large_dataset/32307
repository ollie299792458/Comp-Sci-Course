Okay, so there were some dissapointments, in particular I was disspointed at the opening piece, it didn't close things up right for me.  However, one must also realize that this is not one continuous movie, it is a collection of shorts.  Different animation teams worked on different pieces, take a look at the credits.  There is one segment on this DVD that makes it worth buying, the Firebird.  It is the only thing that keeps my Faith in that there are americans that can out-animate Hayao Miyazaki, and I am a huge Miyazaki fan.  This is so much better than the other Disney works because it has imagination that you don't get with even Disney's latest and cutting edge works.  Also, the animation seems like paintings at times.  Okay, it doesn't have all of features of the original compilation, but what were you expecting?  This is a great collection in it's own right.  The only thing that I would have changed is bringing back the Sorcerer's Apprentice, I wanted to see Night on Bald Mountain.  But, who am I to complain.
