David Chute, that guy at the top who really put this film down, as an editor, needs to really reassess his role as a critic. I can see he probably thought Armageddon was a piece of art? Well, Armageddon is one of the worst I have ever seen. I even left the theater...
But Deep Impact, whew! Now that was an emotional ride. Granted, the thing between the kids didn't do much for me, but the overall situation where the impending doom forced the government to choose 1 million people and no one over 50 would be included... That in itself was a lot. The desperation of surviving an event that could very well happen for real knowing there is nothing we can actually do; not even having a ship as portrayed in the movie, is really alarming.
The film was well made. Yes, Hollywood was all over it, but it was a disaster movie unlike any I have seen. And I have seen many. Oh, and a Black president! who knew? This trend was then followed by the series 24, and then by our real lives. But enough of that.
Deep Impact was a pleasant surprise that summer, one that surpassed even this year's summer movies (with the exception of Star Trek).
See it. You won't be disappointed.
