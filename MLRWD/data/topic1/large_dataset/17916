This is based on an incredible true story. Heinrich Harrer (played by Brad Pitt)is a young, arrogant and Austrian. He (not so voluntarily) endorses Nazi propaganda with his fame. At the beginning of the movie he decides to climb Mt. Nanga Parbat in the Himalayas to escape the pressures brought on by his wife's recent pregnancy. He runs into some troubles along the way, turning his few-month-expedition, into several years [seven to be exact!;) ] Accompanied by fellow Austrian Peter Aufschnaiter (played by David Thewlis), they find themselves in the Tibetan holy city of Lhasa. There, he meets the Dalai Lama, who is the traditional governmental ruler and highest priest of the dominant sect of Buddhism in Tibet. Through his journey and experiences in Tibet, Heinrich is forced to transform into an older, wiser and more humble man.

My little synopsis in no way does justice to how beautiful this movie truly is...Though I'm not particularly fond of Brad Pitt, he performs superbly in this piece. His accent is great (I love how he says 'shut up' in here!) and he does the emotions so well...One of the supporting actors, David Thewlis, also played his part magnificently. He plays a wonderful character, who seems to complement Pitt's character very well in that they're very much opposites of each other. I haven't seen many Pitt or Thewlis  movies, but this one is by far my favorite of both of them.
