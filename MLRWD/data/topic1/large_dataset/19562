This is not so much a review as a recollection, and I won't go into how I got to this website, but Secret of Roan Inish is among my top favorites. It has been a couple years since I have watched this video. but reading the other reviews urged me to write. 
As I remember the story, John Sayles' Ireland is as much about shoreline, deep dark sea waters, as it is about rolling green hills (no Irish postcard pictures here). It's a blend of soaring seagulls and longing looks in a seal's eyes as it is about the choking air of factories and fish markets. It's about those same seagulls and seals watching us, eventually taking on a spirit function of guardians and guides. As much about a grandfather's faith in  his tales, as a skeptical grandmother's hidden hope that they are true.
