Though this is really predictable, like almost all romantic comedies, this is still worth an hour or so of your time. It starts out with two people whose lives hit the skids around the same time. Deciding to make themselves feel better they head to no other place but Vegas. They meet by accident, then, after a night of drinking, partying, and other things wake up to find they accidently got married! Not totally unusual.

They decide they want to get divorced, but then have their first marital spat and inside of it they find they win $3 million dollars. That's when the trouble starts.

They're sentenced to actually spend 6 months as a couple(the twist part). The first few months are the most fun part of the movie. From missing doors, dishes, parties and a bread fight, they do some pretty awful things to each other that I'm sure has crossed the minds of those in a relationship before, nevermind just being married. I found those to be absolutely hilarious.

The second half of the movie is where the romance creeps in. But the romance wasn't the crappy, sappy, men will want to let it be known their girlfriends made them watch it and not because they wanted to, type romance. It's actually rather sweet and the type you'd wish there were more of in a romantic comedy. Light. It's still a comedy after all.

The ending was a forgone conclusion from the beginning, but it's worth it.
