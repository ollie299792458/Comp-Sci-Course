I'm not sure where to really start with this review. Or if I even have that much to say about the movie. I've been sitting here thinking about what to write and that can't be a good thing. I feel like, when you watch a movie you should either be super pumped about it and have tons to write OR super disappointed. So, I guess I'm feeling kind of...neutral towards 'One Missed Call.'

'One Missed Call' is the American remake of a Japanese movie...called 'One Missed Call.' lol. So, it sucks in comparison. I haven't review the Japanese version yet but I've definitely seen it. I'll have to go out this week and buy it so I can review it. While the acting in the American version is good, they just completely mutilated the remake. I'm not a fan but that's not to say it was a complete waste. It still has some alright parts...there is nothing scary or creepy about it though. Which is disappointing.

Overall, the American version of 'One Missed Call' was ok. I definitely could have picked something better to fill my time. You can see it...or not. It really makes no difference but if there is something better (which there is a lot of) definitely watch it first. Don't go out of your way for this one.
