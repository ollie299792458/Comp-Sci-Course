As others have indicated, if you think you have it figured out, you will be totally surprised before the end.  As suspense films go, everything fits together when you get to the end with nothing that suspends belief (unlike another film I recently saw).  The acting is very well done.

I gave the film only four stars because of the thoroughly gratuitous use of one very frequent four letter word.  Its use is so over the top that it takes away from everything else.  I saw the film in a theater.  Some months later we were on an overseas flight and "Inside Man" was the in-flight movie.  There were small children on the flight.  I wondered how that would work, given the ubiquitous use of that word.  Well, the word never occurred anywhere in the film!  Further, no one's lips were out of synchronization with the dialogue at any point. I have since read that Singapore will not allow films with foul language in them.  Apparently, film companies must shoot two versions of the same film.  They could give us films with less objectionable material, but choose not to do so.  They even have the same films with less objectionable material already available.  Can I give Hollywood two stars only?
