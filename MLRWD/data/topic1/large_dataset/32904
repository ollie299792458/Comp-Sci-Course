This really isn't a bad deal at all given the individual price of the movies. However, if you're only interested in the movies and not the box set, then try to take advantage of the buy one get one free offer from Amazon. I wasn't planning to get these movies until much later next year, but after seeing that offer it was more like a reflex to purchase all 5 movies. I may not have the box, but I sure got the set. I already have 10 HD-DVDs and that doesn't include these movies nor the 5 free movies. So far all of them look spectacular on the HD-A30. I expect these to be no different. Now all I want is a Lord Of The Rings HD-DVD collection and I'm good.

OMG! I just had to come back and add to this review. I'd move this from a 4* to a 5*. Simply unbelievable. I bought the individual movies instead of the box set, but it should be the same. Using the HD-A30 (HD-DVD player) in 1080p/24 and my LN-T4671F (HDTV) with Auto Motion Plus on High, it feels like I'm on the set watching them make the movie. The more you watch HD content, the more you realize how big of a jump it is from standard DVDs, much less coming from a standard TV. If you're a fan, then you should already have these movies. While I'm not really a big fan but simply like movies, I'll have to say that this year is off to a great start. With that said, these aren't the only set of HD movies I have. I also have Planet Earth, Riddick, Transformers, Matrix collection, Bourne collection, etc. If you trying to decide on whether to get the HD version vs the Standard version, take my advice. Get the HD version.
