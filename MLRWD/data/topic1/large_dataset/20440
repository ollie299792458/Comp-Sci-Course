For fans of the first eight seasons of SG-1, this is a must-have. Not only is the filming far beyond what I'd expect to see on TV, the acting (especially by Amanda Tapping and Claudia Black) is outstanding. For those who like action, the CGI was good (though thankfully limited) and it's really hard to beat the big shots provided by the Arctic and all that military hardware! It was also very nice to see bit parts played by real armed forces personnel, just as in the past. Being a fan of time travel and alternate universe themes myself, the plot was well-done and was quite a bit different than what they've done in the past. The only complaint I might have would be that there was no forward movement in the development of the main characters, something to be expected in AT/AU stories.

However, I did come away with a much better appreciation for Cam Mitchell, which is a big deal for me.  I also never cared for Vala up until now- but Vala/Qe'tesh was superb in this movie, thanks to Claudia Black. Though his part wasn't big, it was great seeing O'Neill again, especially Colonel O'Neill, and it looks like there's still something up with the General and Carter. In general, though, this is an action film and all of the  character interactions are necessarily brief. Another ten minutes of run time could have given us that great team banter back again, and there were flashes of that, but they were limited by (I presume) aiming for a two-hour TV time slot.

All in all, I'd say the movie was technically very nice, exciting to watch, had a few nice character moments, and carries the story arcs developed in SG-1 very well. Since Ark of Truth and Continuum were great caps to two of the main story arcs, I'm looking forward to new adventures in future movies and maybe find out what the heck O'Neill has been up to the last few years, because certainly it seems that the SG-1 saga is far from over.
