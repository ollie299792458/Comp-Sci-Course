I'm not going to say that I hate this movie, because I don't.  It's a fun movie to watch...if you're not familiar with the comic book, and you're not a purist.

Which I am both.

It's not the acting in this film; I loved it all.  From Stallone's 'Jut-Out-Chin' portrayal of Dredd (IMHO, ONLY Stallone can say 'I Am The Law', and have you believe it), to Max Von Sydow's weary Chief Justice.  It's not the special effects or set design, either; they got those both down pat.

The fault with this film lies squarely with the writers.  They screwed up his story something fierce, and the actors made do with what they had, which they did brilliantly.  It's like I always say, 'It could have been brilliant on a level unimagined...if the writers had gotten the story right'.  They got several key points wrong in this film, but I'll list the top four:

One: Judge Joseph Dredd never, ever ever ever ever ever ever ever EVER took off his helmet.  EVER.
Two: Judge Fargo was long dead by the time Joseph Dredd was born.
Three: It is completely forbidden for Judges to engage in intimate relationships.
Four: Since Rico was a former Judge, he should not have been in Aspen.  The jail for crooked judges was called Titan orbiting Jupiter (if I remember that right...I'll edit it if I'm wrong).

I'm not saying 'Don't see this movie', because it really IS a fun ride.  It only loses a star because of the accuracy of the story.
