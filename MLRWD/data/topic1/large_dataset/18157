James Cameron is a filmmaker, not a scientist.  Despite his pretensions to the contrary, he is not "doing science" in this film.  I watched the extended version, and only something like a quarter of the footage consisted of the admittedly beautiful undersea photography.  Visually, this is a fine film.  The problem is the relentlessly irritating dialog.  The phoney, self-indulgent, cliche-ridden conversations that make up most of the "human interest" portion of the film make every minute a chore to watch.  The effect is similar to that of having to listen to a group of strangers having a deeply personal conversation amongst themselves that doesn't involve you, except more stilted and lifeless.

Also, James Cameron needs to learn that not everyone is as in love with him as he is with himself and that not everyone cares to see and hear him pat himself on the back for being such a pioneering underwater explorer.

I am not joking when I recommend watching this with your television's mute button activated.  Other than some silly bloviating by Cameron and Co. about how this is just like exploring other planets, there is no substantial science in this movie (and the science that is there is highly speculative).  You do yourself no favors by listening to anything said by anyone in this film.  Just enjoy the pretty pictures.
