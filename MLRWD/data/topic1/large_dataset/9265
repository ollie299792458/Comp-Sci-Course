First of all I would like to commend Amazon.com for getting my order to me in two days even using the free super saver shipping, beating their estimate by a week.  I've been waiting for this release for a long time!  Unlike many of the other reviewers, I did not have this on tape nor do I have cable so it has been many moons (no pun intended?) since I last saw any episodes except the pilot.  I've watched the first three episodes so far and I am happy I bought the set!  I won't repeat the episode details since so many others have done that except to say that Bruce and Cybil were perfect casting.

As for the DVD's, the picture quality is very good.  One reviewer commented that the sound level was low and after watching three episodes, I've found that the level on the first two is higher than on the third one.  It isn't muffled, just lower so turning up the volume is an easy fix.  Also, thank you to Lion's Gate for (1) giving this volume a decent price, unlike the greed that is associated with the release of Northern Exposure's seasons; (2) using single-sided discs with classy labeling; (3) having a nice package for the DVD's; and very importantly, (4) not bombarding us with ads and other unnecessary garbage that we are forced to watch or else flip through at the beginning of the discs!  Instead it goes right to the menu, which is what all of us want.  Nice job!  Moonlighting was a wonderful series and Lions Gate did the DVD's right.  I can't comment about the missing or substituted music clips since that may have been beyond their control.
