Great Movie, excellant resolution.  Marjorie Reynolds is beautiful and was a very talented actress.  Most people probably remember her as William Bendix's wife in "The Life of Riley" on television in the 50's and 60's when her hair was brunette and she was older, of course.  The music is wonderful, especially "White Christmas" which was heard for the first time in this movie and was thought that it would not become the hit it did.

Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire were at their usual best.  I would highly recommend this film for purchase for anyone's dvd library of great movies. The other members of the cast were fun to watch too.

If you have never seen this movie, you have missed seeing one of the best.  Although it is in black and white it still is a beautiful film.

I had seen parts of it in the past on television, but never in its entirety until I purchased it here at Amazon.com.  I am, certainly, happy I bought it and was able to see it in its complete form.

Although I love the color movie "White Christmas" from 1954 and saw it, originally, at the movie theater, starring Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera Ellen, and it is one of my all time favorites, "Holiday Inn" was as enjoyable for me to see and have for my collection (and I am Jewish).

Buy it and you won't be sorry.
