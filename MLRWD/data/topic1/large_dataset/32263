1-Hour DVD, subjective analysis editorializing one man's view of the Bush family and their political ties, real and imagined. This Oliver Stone- wannabe-ish production lacks the polish and panache of Stone or even of notorious far-left Bush-basher, Michael Moore, both in production quality and investigative content..assuming that one buys what Moore is also peddling. Extreme liberals will love this and accept it as fact, sensible people will disregard most of it and accept the rest as American politics as usual. Republicans will ignore it, as they likely should. Nothing new is exposed here, no new light shed on topics that are now long-in-the-tooth in the twilight of the Bush administration's tenure. Far too much over-intellectualizing of alleged Bush family influence-peddling and not enough serious discussion of the fact that every American presidential administration MUST use influence..whether through finance or favoritism...in its dealings with corrupt, non-democratic regimes around the world if they want to get anything done. Influence is THE international capital universally recognized and worth investing. And by the way, if you think that NO DEMOCRAT would do such a thing, I've got some coastal property in Louisiana that I can sell you real cheap too...!! Just go back ONE administration to The Clintons, for the textbook on influence peddling. No one gets out of DC unscathed. Bush is no different. Don't waste your money on this particular video production. Find something with a little objectivity.
