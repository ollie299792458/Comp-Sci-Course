The same people who complain about the junk coming out of Hollywood seem to be the ones who line up for the summer blockbusters instead of digging a little deeper. My wife and I love finding independent films that deserve more attention. With a stellar cast, we wanted to see where "The Lucky Ones" would take us.

This isn't a perfect film, and it doesn't work on every level, but the three performances alone make it a joy to watch. All three play Iraqi vets on the way back home, two for leave, one for good. All three have been wounded. All three have deeper issues than the marks on their outer bodies. Thrown together by flight cancellations, they drive cross country and discover more about each other and themselves in the process.

The film makes some subtle observations about society, though the insensitivity of some college students seemed a little much--maybe I've just never met such idiots. McAdams, as always, is likeable and easy to empathize with. Pena, despite one reviewer's distaste for him, is a very fine actor--compare his neurotic, hard-edged side here to the soft-hearted guy in "Crash." And Tim Robbins shows some real depth without overdoing it.

The ending is not as predictable as it might seem halfway through. In some ways, the lack of predictability seems somewhat forced, but it also provides for a patriotic and poignant look at the struggles of those who serve our nation. I enjoyed the movie for its humor, humanity, and insight.
