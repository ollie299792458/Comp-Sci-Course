I read the book a few months before buying the dvd set. Just after purchasing the book I ended up renting the dvd set, and then later bought it here on Amazon. If you have not read the story, it's about a man Richard who lives in London above and then ventures into London below, a fantasy realm where he adventures and fights to help a friend Door.

The overall feel of the video is lower budget than a large production house. The acting is at times decent, the sets while interesting do feel small but the interesting story line makes up for the difference. It's similar to watching older Dr. Who where the story is more interesting and you follow it rather than noticing the flaws of the acting. The video quality is not very sharp and could be the same issue of a lower budget production.

Overall, I would recommend this dvd set if you are interested in Neil Gaiman's other works such as Stardust where adventuring in fantasy lands is the norm. It's not a super polished dvd set but still something good to watch when you are looking for something different. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because of the slight short comings and video quality.
