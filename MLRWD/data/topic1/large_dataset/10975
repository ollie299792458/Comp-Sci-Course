This indy directed by Win Wenders and written and lead-acted by Sam Sheppard will stay with me for a long while.

For one thing, if the immortal Edward Hopper became a movie director instead of a painter, he'd probably end up shooting this beauty. The Montana town where the movie was shot is straight out of a Hopper painting, exploding with sharp lonely shadows and stark sunlight, creating an eerie space where human folly and loneliness is impossible to hide.

The story is a curious one, about an over-the-hill western-movie star running away from a movie set to go see his mom, played by Eva Marie Saint of the unforgettable North by Northwest, still looking beautiful at her age and acting superbly.

Then the movie take a sharp turn towards a father-son drama, with a daughter also thrown in from an unexpected subplot.

This is the story of a selfish man who had been away for too long from a family that he did not even knew he had. His attempts to put the broken Humpty Dumpty back together again is heartbreaking but Sam Shepard's acting is so good and his handsome cragged Marlboro Man face is so appropriate for the part that his acting almost redeems his character - almost.

See this one for a quality American drama that does not have a single stale bone in it.
