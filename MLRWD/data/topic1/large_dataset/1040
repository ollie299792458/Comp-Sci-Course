When I first saw this movie, I knew nothing of its ancestry and simply took it on its own terms, as a musical with some of the leading music-makers of the day: Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Louis Armstrong. I enjoyed it thoroughly. The Crosby-Sinatra duet in the library, "Well Did You Evah," was fabulous - I rewound and played it ovah and ovah. Satchmo lit up every scene he was in, and I loved Louis Calhern as aging playboy Uncle Willy. Grace Kelly, I think, is a matter of taste, one I never developed - but as an ice princess, oh yes, no problem believing that. Was Bing Crosby too old for the once-and-future lover? Of course he was, as were most of the male leads in those days - in Daddy Long Legs, Fred Astaire looked old enough to be Leslie Caron's grandfather - but Crosby looked good in sports clothes, was probably as rich in real life as Dexter in the movie, and after all invented crooning.

All in all, I love the movie and have seen it dozens of times over the years, every time smiling from end to end. As for Philadelphia Story, well, Katharine Hepburn could not make a bad movie (that's a taste I found easy to develop), and all the other actors were terrific too, and so was the movie - but regardless of plot similarities, it's a totally different genre, and I can't imagine Cary Grant singing True Love (yes, I know Cole Porter wrote it for High Society, but had it existed in 1940, I still can't imagine Cary Grant singing it). By the way, I have a recording of Kiri Te Kanawa singing the song, though it was composed specifically for Grace Kelly's limited range (and Kiri's voice has no limits), beautifully.

Highly highly recommended.
