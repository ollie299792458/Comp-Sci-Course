I have read the other reviews for this movie and I have to say, the movie is not that bad.  IT'S COMEDY!!!!  It is not a movie to kiss or cuddle up to.  You are suppose to burst your gut.  The plot of the story is very good. It is about a geeky orphan who growns up and becomes married to his long life bossy, ungrateful partner Rasputia. When Norbit was a young orphan, he had a childhood love named Kate. Well Kate got adoption when they were about about six years old and Norbit did not see her again until they were in their mid 30's maybe, at that time Norbit was already married to Rasputia and he hated the married and Rasputia.  In this movie Norbit is just a caring, geeky guy who has seemed to married the wrong girl.  He gets a chance to try to rekindle his love for Kate when she comes back into town, but he has a big problem, Rasputia.  Also Kate come back into town with a con artist boyfriend, but she does not know he is a con.  Throughout the movie there are jokes set in place to make it a comedy of course, but it's more to the movie than what people are saying.  This movie takes you into a unnoticable close community and you really feel the love towards the end of the movie.

Eddie is just being the Eddie we all love.  But the movie is not bad at all.  I feel sorry for the people who thought they were going to see a drama or something, and got a suprise when they saw unusual, unruly, acts that do not normally happen in real life lol! IT'S COMEDY!  So if you are open minded about a comedy movie I suggest you see this movie.  I really enjoyed the scenes, the actors, the setting, and the plot; they all fit together nicely.  Eddie is a great actor period....

But everybody have different taste, you know.  I am going to buy this movie when it comes out. :)
