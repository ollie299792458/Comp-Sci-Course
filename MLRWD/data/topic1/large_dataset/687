Wow! Holiday inn is such a wonderful movie!! And so filled with the spirit of christmas. And I definetely agree with everyone here, this is not a film just for christmas. The tunes, and beats, and scores in this movie are really, top rate!

Fred is perfect for Ted Hannover. This movie begins with a wonderful song, and dance performed by Fred, Bing, and there girl dance partner. And this partner, Lila Dixon, is engaged to be married to Jim (Bing). Until, Ted, (Astaire)explains how much he loves her. So she promises to marry him, but is still figuring out a way to tell Jim. When the news is finally dumped on him, Jim leaves show business, to live on a farm where he plans on being ''Lazy,'' and celebrating holidays. And then one day, he gets a brainstorm. He decides to turn the farm into Holiday Inn!!

I hate to hive the whole plot, laughs, trials, and everything away to you. For if I told you everything, the movie would be dull, because you know what was going to happen next.

But, I will tell you this, this WAY TO GOOD to be watched only around christmas. This is a great movie with humor, songs, taps, and filled with the magical wonder of Christmas.
