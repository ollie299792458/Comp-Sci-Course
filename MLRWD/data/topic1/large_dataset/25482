"Hooligans of the world unite. We've got nothing to burn but your intellectuals..." [Hornbeck points to the angry mob outside] "Well, those are the boobs that make our laws. It's the democratic process." -E.K. Hornbeck in Inherit the Wind

If you are looking for a movie about the 1920s Scopes Monkey Trial get a documentary. There are many more messages in this film. In Hillsboro, Heavenly Hillsboro, everybody is the same. The citizens have the same religious beliefs and attend the same church.

This is a film about Bert Cates, the man who dared to express a different opinion from theirs. This is a film about the cultural clash between North and South - between urban and rural America. This is a film about intellectualism vs. fundamentalism and the importance of free thought. Drummond argues the right to think is on trial. The people of Hillsboro not only dismiss Darwinian Theory but stated that they don't even want to consider it.

Ultimately it's about defending Cates right to be different. There is a powerful moment when Cates wants to drop the case and Drummond tells him:

"I understand what you're going through. It's the loneliest feeling in the world - to find yourself standing up when everybody else is sitting down. To have everybody look at you and say, 'What's the matter with him?' I know. I know what it feels like. Walking down an empty street listening to the sound of your own foot steps. Shutters closed, blinds drawn, doors locked against you. And you aren't sure whether you're walking toward something or walking away.
But all you have to do is knock on any door and say, 'If you let me in, I'll live the way you want me to live, and I'll think the way you want me to think,' and all the blinds will go up and all the windows will open, and you'll never be lonely, ever again."

This is a film for anyone who wants to live the way they want to live and think the way they want to think.
