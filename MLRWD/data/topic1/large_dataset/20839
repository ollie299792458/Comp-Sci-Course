John Ford was once accused of killing more Indians than the US Cavalry. 
True Ford fans know Ford *always* respected the Native American in his films. His films did not take the "savage" approach to the American Indian, but always treated the tribes as the professional light cavalry that they were. 
Still, in this movie, Cheyenne Autumn, he dramatically shows the plight of the Native Americans, and the two-faced and uncaring U.S. Government. This story is the epic tale of the remaining Cheyenne warriors, driven from their homes into a reservation far from where they belonged, and then ignored by a government who consigned them to poverty and betrayal. 
Beautifully photographed, as all John Ford movies were, this is a different sort of Western, but one that is nevertheless well worth watching. It stars some non-Indian "stars" in some Indian
parts, but it dramatically addresses the plight of the American Indian tribes. As in most Ford westerns, Navajo tribespeople stood in for their Cheyenne brothers.
