I have a lot of documentary on DVD. From Cities of the Underworld to almost anything made by the history channel I have a lot of DVDs about History, True Crimes and the Paranormal. After all these years and countless Hours spent in front of the TV I think my Unsolved Mysteries DVDs are still my favorites.

I bought this set 4 years ago and I still watch it all the time, this DVD set is just unbelievable, in my opinion the second best DVD set ever made (right after Unsolved Mysteries: Strange Legends). There's just too many amazing stories featured on this set: The Roswell Incident, Bentwaters, Allagash, The Hudson Valley sightings, The Belgium sightings, The Roswell/Area 51 Connection, The "Guardian" UFO video, The Men in Black, The Mexico sightings, The Phoenix lights, Investigation about Alien Abductions, Crop Circles.......

This set is just incredible, so fun to watch, I know I'll watch all these segments over and over again for the next 4+ years !! Buy this DVD, it's that good. :)
