I was taken to see this movie by a female friend of mine. I didn't know anything about the movie except that there would be stepping in it and a fraternity story tied into it. So of course I expected to see a movie that was right along the lines of school daze. Totally wrong!!!!! Stomp the yard should have been named You got served 2 or drumline 2 because it was more focused on dancing than on Frat life and stepping. The average  age in the movie theater was around 14 years of age so this movie really wasn't geared toward a 30 year black greek. When stepping was shown, (which wasn't a lot of the movie) the scenes were decent. I was more impressed with the B-Boy dance scenes when the actors were break dancing. I made sure to ask some friends of mine that are in other frats (alphas, ques) what they thought of  the movie and they all felt the same as me. The movie did not show the positive aspects of the frat (community service, mentoring) and only made it look like frats are about partying and dancing. For an outsider looking in you will probably think that this movie is great. But if you know anything about frats or you are in a frat/sorority you most likely won't like it. Yo! to the NUPES!
