I like Anthony Hopkins and most of the other actors in this movie; I felt it had a great cast. Those who liked it may have read what it was about beforehand. Try watching it like most people, just seeing the trailer/commercial. You're led to believe Slipstream is more of a time travel movie where the person is sent into the past to change things they're afraid of, etc. (this definition of the word slipstream is stated by one of the characters talking to Anthony) but that never happens. So, with that introduction, and no information or sense of what his current life/reality is, you watch the movie trying to figure out which parts are past, present or possibly future. As it turns out, it's all "present" but you never really get that.

I have a good sense of humor (I don't care for the "Three Stooges" type of humor, but today's type I enjoy) but I saw NOTHING humorous about this movie and didn't even realize it was supposed to be a comedy 'til after I'd seen it. I'm also not "easily confused" as a reviewer felt negative reviewers might be. When someone asks, for example, "Do you know the time?", it is generally understood to mean, "Please tell me the time if you know it" and the typical response may be, "12:35". However, another valid, but less expected (and less enlightening) response would be, "Yes, I do. Thanks for asking." This is sort of what goes on in this movie. When they said they lost the plot, since the movie is about people filming a movie, it's naturally assumed the person is referring to THAT movie's plot, NOT the one you rented ("Slipstream").

Everything else I have to say against this movie has already been made clear in other people's reviews. All I can add is that we felt we'd lost that time we could've spent watching something worthwhile instead of this misleading waste of time.
