I personally thought the movie was great.  I think it was darker than the first two and I would certainly take note that it is PG-13.  I fell in love with the first two and couldn't wait for the third movie to debut.  Truthfully, the Pirates theme is not my cup of tea, but I am a Depp fan.  If I hadn't been, I would have never went to see the first one.  And even then I had my doubts, but was quickly captivated.  I have now seen the first two more times than I can count and went to see At World's End twice, and will own it.

As for it being difficult to understand, I didn't have much trouble.  It is a little confusing in places.  I watched the first two again prior to going to the theatre so I had it all in recent memory.  All of the movies have twists and little things that you probably don't catch the first time.  The movie is theatrical and it is a little crazy, quite unrealistic...but it's Disney!  And it's Johnny Depp.  Again, I am a big fan, so I might be jaded.  I can't imagine not liking this trilogy.  I think all the actors did a fantastic job.  There's something in the movie for everyone-romance, adventure, action, blood, and of course for those sister fans...Mr. Depp.

It's fun and mysterious.  Captain Sparrow is who everyone wants to be...we all want to be the pirate who really isn't that bad!  We all want that freedom on the horizon.  We all want to be able to take what we can and leave nothing behind, but morality gets in the way.  So when Jack CAN do it, and still be the good guy, it's the perfect fantasy!  If for nothing else, I think everyone who has seen the first two should see this film.
