I don't know how this film stayed under the radar in its time.  It's a great family movie, a little formulaic and has been done before, but very fresh and well done.  When I saw Edward Norton I thought I might not like it, not that he is a poor actor (on the contrary, I think he's very talented) but this didn't seem his "kind" of movie.  Boy was I ever wrong, he does a great job with it, but the character of Eisenheim fits in well with his seemingly "real" personality...the soft-spoken, intelligent illusionist.  Also features Rufus Sewell as the "bad guy" Prinz Leopold, and I think Sewell is one of the most under-rated actors in Hollywood.  Why doesn't this guy do more stuff?  Top it all off with Jessica Biehl who I've NEVER seen do a poor job in ANYTHING she's been in, and it helps I think she's also a knock-out!  This movie is very, very well-acted, all around.  The setting and scenery are great, and I didn't even mind that it took place in Austria and they were all speaking English, one thing that usually peeves me and can remove me from the story quicker than anything else.  The musical score is also fantastic!  Get the family together, gather up the snacks and the drinks, park yourselves around the TV and prepare for a night of movie enjoyment.  A classically GOOD film!  Huzzah!
