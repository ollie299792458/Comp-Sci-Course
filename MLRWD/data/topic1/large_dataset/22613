Plot line differences:

The dog: The fact that he started off with the dog was a disappointment.  In the book, he was nearly insane with loneliness by the time he found the dog, and it saves his sanity.  Either they should have stuck to the source or not borrowed this from it.

The monsters:  In both book and previous movies they were still fairly intelligent, could talk and plot against him, and  in the end formed their own society.  Were where the mental chess games between him hunting and them hiding?  I'd be ok with some major changes here, but they still need to show more hunting and seeking than just two scenes.

His house: In both the book and the movie it was an impenetrable fortress, which led to its own claustrophobic problems.  I loved in the book how they would call to him and wage psychological games with him, like the women flashing him anytime he looked out the window, and taunting him to come out and play.  I the origian movie they would call to him and throw things at the house.  This was completely left out of this movie.  When they did "find" his house they broke through the iron gates and barred windows in a matter of seconds.  This was unbelievable, porely explained, and a total let down.

While I am disappointed with the writers, the acting was fairly good.  I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater, but I am not sorry I watched it on DVD, and I will probably buy the two disk set just to see the alternate ending which I have not yet viewed. Perhaps it is better.

Overall a C+.
