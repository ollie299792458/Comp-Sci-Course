I am absolutely flummoxed that no one who has reviewed this movie in these pages so far 'gets' what it's really about.  It seems so obvious to me!It's NOT about the magic.  It's NOT about the witchcraft.  It's NOT about the romance.It's about the power of numbers.  In particular, it's about how a group of women can achieve results in the fight against the physical abuse of womankind, when a single victim, with or without the help of a friend or relative or two, can not.  On a lesser scale, it's also about how women who are not prone to victimization can rescue those who are. Is a pumpkin pie about the spice?  Is a dish that is served 'flambe' about the alcohol?  This movie contains a lot of "food for thought."  Superficially, yes, it is a bit of fluff, not meant to be taken seriously or as a work of art.  But dig a bit deeper for goodness sake!  There's a lot to dig for here!Sandra Bullock [Sally] is wonderful as the thoughtful, sensitive sister.  Nicole Kidman is, if anything, even better as the flighty, unthoughtful, prone-to-be-victimized sibling [Gillian].  (And it's a master touch that one of Sally's kids looks exactly like a small Gillian!)My only complaint is with the soundtrack, which so many reviewers have gushed about.  There are two ways of using well-known songs as plot devices in a movie.  One is to choose songs that meld right into the story line [see O Brother, Where Art Thou, for example].  The other is to make the plot line swerve to incorporate the desired song.  Unfortunately, this movie chose the latter path.  They're good songs, one and all, but they jar here because they don't seamlessly fit the story line.As to the Special Features on the DVD, forget trying to find the clues in the Menu Pages to unlock the Cauldron.  If they're there, my wife and I certainly couldn't find them.  It's much easier to turn the DVD case upside down and read the fine print footnote on the inside front cover.  It's all spelled out!
