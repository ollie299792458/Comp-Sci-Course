Joe and Jerry (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon) are on the run from the chicago mob after witnessing the St Valentine's Day massacre. They decide to disguise themselves and dress up as women adopting the names Josephine and Daphne and join an all female band heading for a gig in Florida, as saxophone and double bass players. During the train ride to Florida they meet the lead singer of the band Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). Joe falls for Sugar who has a thing for saxophone players and is a loser in love. 
Once in Florida Joe dresses up as a millionare playboy and adopts the voice of Cary Grant to pursue Sugar, giving himself the name Shell Oil Junior! Meanwhile, Daphne/Jerry is hotly pursued by Joe E Brown a millionaire playboy who's been divorced three times and is looking for wife number four. Little do Joe and Jerry know that the mobsters have also arrived in Florida for a convention. 
This is a wonderful fastpace slapstick comedy with a couple of wonderful songs sung by Marilyn Monroe including "I want to be loved by you" and "Running Wild". Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are a scream dressed up in drag and Marilyn Monroe is sensual as the ditzy Sugar Kane. The three main leads interact well with each other despite rumours that there were problems between Monroe and Curtis on the set during shooting. A must see for all film buffs and lovers of romantic comedy films.
