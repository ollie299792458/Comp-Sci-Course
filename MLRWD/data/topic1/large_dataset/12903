This is an enjoyable and interesting movie. It is the work of Milos Forman of Amadeus fame. It is not the stunning, fast-paced and colorful display of Amadeus, but it is a fine looking and entertaining film chocked full of tasty historical and philosophical tidbits.  It also has that sense of mystery that made Amadeus so great.

I thought it would be more biographical, but it turns into an interesting story about the end of the Golden Age of Spain as well as perspective on the War of Independence.

I won't give the story away because it is much more fun for the viewer to be surprised at the interesting twists and turns.

The acting can at times be a little stiff, but once the story was completed I appreciated it as a whole. So be patient and let it unfold.

The portrayal of Goya is subtle. He is not lionized or trashed. Stellan Skarsg√•rd plays the role with a degree of sophistication and worldliness that is surprising.  The acting of Natalie Portman is a take it or leave it proposition. However, the Brother Lorenzo played by Javier Bardem is a witty and enjoyable villain on par with Maestro Salieri.  Randy Quaid is truly memorable as the aging, dimwitted King of Spain.

Many interesting historical events and artistic developments are on display in the film, so it is a feast for the lover of Spanish culture.

We can only hope we will see many more films of this kind.  The movies is hardly a slave to history or a slave to convention. In telling an interesting story, the film gets the facts over and implies a great deal about life in Madrid at the turn of the 19th Century.

I have the DVD on the shelf and I am anxious to show it to another friend who has not seen it yet. It really adds to a pleasant day and gives you and your literary friends a lot to talk about.
