We all know how great and brilliant the show itself is so I don't need to  get into that. And of course, it's great to watch the episodes in digital  format and be able to skip to any scene instantly, etc. Here are the  drawbacks: the audio is in Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround, not the superior 5.1  surround (even the Star Trek: Original Series DVD's come in 5.1 Surround,  and this show is from the 60's!) Also, there are only 2 deleted scenes,  both involving Scully's would-be boyfriend, in the pilot...THAT's IT! There  are no other deleted scenes nor outakes. Third, the seventh and last DVD  has 10 and 20 second trailors for each of the episodes but it is tedious to  sit down and watch each of these trailors one after the other. Instead,  each of the trailors should have preceded the actual episodes or succeed  the episode before (this is how it is actually done when you see the show  and when you see the DVD's for Star Trek: Original Series). But then, that  would leave Fox to find other things to fill the last DVD with :-).  However, overall, it is still great to have this collection of X-Files and  it takes up very little space (there are 4 episodes/DVD, unlike the Star  Trek DVD's which have two episodes/DVD and take up five times as much  space.
