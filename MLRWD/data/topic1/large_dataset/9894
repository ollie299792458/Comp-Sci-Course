This is my second favorite of the Star Trek movies.  It is so wondrfully done with imagination and brilliantly written dialogue.  A massive object is approaching Earth with a deadly force capable of wiping out the entire planet. It is up to Kirk, Spock and the crew to fight past its defences to descover its vulnerability and save the planet from untter enialation.  The score is beautiful, the costums are rediculas and the effects are masterful.  I think Gene would have been proud of how it was turned out after having so many production problems leading up to its initial release.  The did not take away from the movie at all-only added.  My only issue corresponds with some of the scenes that were cut from the full version.  Some of the greatest conversations were left out???  Anyway, a worthy movie that was missread by many Star Trek fans as they were expecting slam,bag,action instead of intelligence-the problem with most sci-fi movies these days including the last three star treks.  If you give it chance and follow the story and dialogue and character development, then you will hopefully appreciate a movie tha was very similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey.
