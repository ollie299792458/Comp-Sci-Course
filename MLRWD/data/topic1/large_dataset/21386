Although the product description relegates the tale of the Iron Monkey to the realm of "myth," it is actually based on the historical true life story of the very real Dr. Yang Tianchun and Nurse Orchid. Wong Fei Hung was also a real person in Chinese history and his later exploits in life are chronicled in both the old and more recent versions of Master Jackie Chan's "Legend of the Drunken Master."

Just to clear up the confusion, "legends" are based on historical fact, while "myths" deal with imaginary 'supernatural' beings like Osiris, Odin, Zeus or Jehovah.

"Iron Monkey" is a fun film to watch whether one digs kung fu or not; the humor is universal and the action sequences are well choreographed and beautifully filmed. The story line is uplifting and conveys a moral lesson as valuable today as when the real Iron Monkey fought corruption and decadence in Canton more than a hundred years ago.

In the end, the viewer comes to realize that Chief Fox knows more than one thinks he does.
