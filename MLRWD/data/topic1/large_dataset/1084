I watched these movies when they came out
Identity - meh
Supremacy - didn't score any points
Ultimatum - pulled the rug out from under me
Watched them all again and finally got it - a rare case of both sequels being better than the first movie.

How many action movies do you see in which the protagonist fights using a book, a magazine and a ball-point pen?
Or in which he goes through mayhem just to say sorry to a girl, for killing her parents?
Or in which he looks apologetic after just choking an assassin to death?
Bourne is no Bond...whew.

The guy has no snappy one-liners, no sunglasses, no sharp clothes, no cool gadgets, no fast cars, no techno-weapons, no beautiful women hanging off his arm, and loses his girl by the second act. He has no team to back him up, there are no mega-explosions or bullet-spraying gun battles, and he is not out for revenge or to save the world. Its about a man trying to understand who he is and why he's done the things that he has.

And all this wrapped up in incredible action movies that have the least staged-looking hand-to-hand combat scenes that I have seen (Supremacy and Ultimatum). Fights with no background music, no slow-motion, all the grunting you'd expect during such brawls and the fighters just trying to use what's around them to their best advantage - close to gritty, real-world stuff.

Downsides - some scenes look a little cheesy (Identity), some a little motion-sickness inducing (Ultimatum) and some repetitiveness (all 3).

But somehow I can watch these movies over and over again...and John Powell's music is excellent.
This is simply a unique series in the action movie genre. What else can I say except that Damon as Bourne will be missed - a flawed guy in a sea of modern-day superheroes. He was what he battles now - an assassin. I like that he's so human.
