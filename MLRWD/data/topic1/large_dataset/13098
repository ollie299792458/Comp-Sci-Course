I'm really not into comic book stuff, and I never did see X-men I. The trailers for X men 2, as well as my friends, induced me into watching it. Although I'm still not into comic book characters, this movie was quiet exceptional. The best part of this movie are the camera techniques that have been used. The underscoring of the movie wasn't so good at first, but it turned out to be ok towards the end. The lighting, parallel editing, and various shots such as high angle, medium, and long were some of the various techniques that helped to emphasize the fights really well. There was this once scene, where a shot of Wolverine's face dissolved into a wolf's, and then back again. I don't remember the exact word for that. There were times during the movie where I got bored, because some of the dialogue just seems monotonous. Some of the fights scenes, besides the angles being great, were sort of bizarre because the people were just twisting and turning in slow motion. If the music, along with the quick body movements are used to accentuate a fight scene, what's the point of showing the bodies flying around slowly?
I also didn't like how the trailers shows Deathstrike's power. It wouldn've been much better and more drastic if people just saw it for the first time in the movie. And what was up with tha guy without the shirt? Apparently he plays a big role in the comic book, but he's just shown two or three times in the entire movie.
I would definately recommend this movie to those who are really into fiction, but for those who are not, it'd be better to just wait for the video/dvd.
