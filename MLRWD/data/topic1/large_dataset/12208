I am autistic, high functioning, like Temple Grandin is, as well as being a visual thinker.  It is often very hard to explain to people in words what it is like, or why it's hard for me to do somethings NTs (neurotypicals or nonautistics for those that don't know) have no issues with, or why somethings bother me severely.  I usually get reactions that just being lazy or whining over nothing, when it's much more than that.

This film accurately captures what it is like for me, at least.  (Autism is extremely diverse, and what's true for one autistic won't be true for all)  And I finally have something I can show my friends and family and point to and say "This is what I've been trying to explain."

Beyond the fact that I can simply relate to much of experiences and difficulties (at least in relation to autism), this film is extremely well made, and highly recommended.  It is highly enjoyable and entertaining to watch regardless of whether or not you you have any connection to autism.  Temple's life and character is an inspiration to all, and the lessons of her life can apply to anyone across the board.

Do watch.
