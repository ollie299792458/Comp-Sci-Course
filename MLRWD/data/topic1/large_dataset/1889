The critical acclaim for this movie was unlike any given to a G-rated attraction in many, many years. Kenneth Turan described it as "the closest to perfection ever achieved in the making of a movie". Dozens of other reviewers declared that it was the first time that a film from another producer had matched the charm and inspiration of the first Disney movies (Snow White, Pinocchio, etc.)

This praise was wholeheartedly justified for a movie which deserves a place next to Disney's best and The Wizard of Oz among Hollywood's most beloved family perennials. What is truly marvelous is that the filmmakers had enough confidence in their story that they believe it can stand alone without the joke book jokes and phony Broadway type musical numbers that plague today's children's films. And that story concludes in a way so touching that it left tears in my eyes in a theater for the first time in my adult life.

It was wonderful that it received a special effects Oscar, but it was a crime that one was not awarded to Christopher Noonan. His direction resulted in the staging of scenes of such charm and visual poetry that they, in their own sentimental way, leave images as memorable as those from Ford, Hitchcock and Scorsese.

This is the first movie that my wife and I ever saw together, and I regard it as a once in a generation film that can create an atmosphere of love for anyone seeing it together.

(You will see a lot of reviews here with complaints about the advertising content of earlier DVD packages from Universal. The Blu-Ray can be purchased with complete confidence as the ad content is minimal and easily avoided.)
