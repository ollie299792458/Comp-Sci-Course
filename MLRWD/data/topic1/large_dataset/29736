Move over Luke Skywalker, the true hero of 80's sci-fi films is here!!! Thank God for sci-fi films, and thank God for "Flash Gordon!" One of the best, and most wildly entertaining sci-fi epics to ever be produced, "Flash Gordon" is a real treat. The film has everything that a moviegoer could ever want in one movie: lots of action(including a great battle scene involving the Hawkmen), humor, great settings & costumes, the single best movie soundtrack EVER ('Flash! Ah-a, savior of the universe!') and the wonderfully over-the-top Brian Blessed as "Vultan." I mean, honestly, is there any movie scene out there that compares to the thrills that you will receive when Vultan's legions of Hawkmen assualt War Rocket Ajax, and that kick-bum battle theme music from Queen kicks in? I think not!! Let's just thank our lucky stars that we have a movie that's the caliber of "Flash Gordon." This film is enjoyable on every level, and will surely become part of the sci-fi lover's home video library. I would honestly marry a woman in a heartbeat if she loved this film as much as I! Don't miss out!!!
P.S. Who knew that a New York Jets quarterback was capable of such amazing feats - honestly, could you picture Broadway Joe doing this? I think not!
