This movie should be mandatory viewing for every household that celebrates any holiday.  It is the perfect example of "there is no such thing as the perfect holiday".  Every December 15th I sit down with presents to my left, wrapping paper to my right, and turn on this movie as I start wrapping presents.  When the movie is over, I re-wind and play it again - and again - and again.  I've worn out three VHS tapes, and I'm working on my old DVD version.  I plan to get this new WIDESCREEN version as soon as it hits the shelves.  It keeps the holiday season in perspective for me - that there really is no such thing as a "perfect" holiday gathering.
Clark W. Griswold wants one thing in life -- The Perfect Christmas.  What he gets is an hilarious mixture of uninvited relatives, feuding in-laws, cheapskate bosses, yuppie-neighbors, rampaging dogs, feisty squirrels, insensitive visitors, a dead cat, and one heck of a wild ride on a bobsled!!!
For anyone that has ever wanted to have a perfect holiday, you must see this movie!!!  It will keep things in perspective for you.
