Ok, I had high hopes for this movie, especially being a cool plot idea where Allied spies infiltrate a hard-to-reach German stronghold.  Starring Clint Eastwood also added to this hope.  In reality, this hope was dashed by annoying acting performance from both Clint Eastwood and most especially Richard Burton, who now is top of my list of most annoying actors ever (alongside Hayden Christensen).  The problem here, is that Burton takes the lead in a condescending "father-knows-best" style, and isn't even cooperative with Eastwood in the movie.  For 2 guys that are supposed to be on the same side, I found myself asking through the entire movie what Eastwood was even doing there.

Pros :
- Breathtaking scenery
- Cool idea

Cons :
- Poorly executed
- Major historical inaccuracies (this is more forgivable since, afterall, it *is* a movie)
- No actual German spoken in the movie.  Subtitles are fine.  Why not use them?
- Eastwood hardly speaks in this movie, is portrayed as woussy second-fiddle to Burton, which is not Eastwood at all.  Eastwood should be the alpha male here.  Who knows why he took a backseat role in this movie.
- Burton = Stilted wooden vacuous acting.  To even call it acting is bequeathing Burton a glorious compliment that I don't wish to gift to him.  Annoying acting and voice.  The lines he utters when walking into the German training camp make me shake my head in disbelief that people like him can be regarded as quality by anyone of reasonable or greater intelligence and standards.

Overall, there's far better WWII movies out there (such as Saving Private Ryan, Kelly's Heros, The Dirty Dozen, and the Band of Brothers series), so I don't see any point wasting time with this one.
