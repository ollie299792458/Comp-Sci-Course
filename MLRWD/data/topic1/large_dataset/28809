From a political perspective, here's what I think of this movie. Even over a span of four decades its humorous plot
has stood the test of time. Those Russians, Chinese, British and assorted wannabes are still in the spy game with even
more sophisticated techniques. The CIA is alive and well. The only change in the FBI is a limit on its power and a one
term length of service for its director.

In 1967 when this movie was released Libya was already bugging the president even though this country was hardly a
blip on the world's trouble spots. How come Libya, not Russia or China was a cause of worry for the president? That's because, two years later (September 1969) an army colonel, Moammar Gadhafi (spell his name any way you prefer)
seized power and continues to rule in 2011.  Ask any theater goer when this film was showing where Libya was.  I'm
sure he or she would have to turn to a world atlas for assistance. Today, even our current president had to tell fellow
Americans why the U.S. has to drop bombs to help the Libyan rebels overthrow their ruthless dictator.

James Coburn gives a creditable performance as the self-assured presidential shrink. His own life begins to unravel.

He cannot turn to another psychiatrist for security reasons. A side plot to this drama occurs when Severn Darden, as
lovable Russian agent Kropotkin teams up with Dick Gregory our man from CEA to cripple that monopolistic
communications conglomerate which is every American's favorite whipping boy - TPC

Today, looking for scapegoats among big businesses continues. We have more entities we can vent our ire on - from
software giants to internet and cell phone service providers. And the list goes on. See this movie at least twice. You may even figure out why that fake British rock and roll trio called themselves  the Pudlians!
