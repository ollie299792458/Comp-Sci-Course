After reading all the reviews for this movie, I was not sure I really wanted to see it, even though I am a insatiable Colin Firth fan and cannot get enough of him. But I decided to risk it, and I am SO very glad that I did! This movie was so good! It was a very intriguing story, great acting, it held my rapt interest from beginning to end. I am not a huge Kevin Bacon fan, but he was incredible in this part, and, I may have to further investigate other things he has done. And of course, as usual, Colin Firth is extraordinary. The only negative thing I have to say is that the part of Karen O'Connor could have been better cast, I felt like Alison Lohman was playing a part in a school play, yeah, she's beautiful, but not up to the part of the journalist she played. That was a bit disappointing, but not disappointing enough for me to dislike this film. When I got the dvd and saw that it have been given "two thumbs up" by Ebert and Roeper, I knew I had a winner, as I rarely disagree with Roger Ebert. Its a great film, high underrated, IMHO.
