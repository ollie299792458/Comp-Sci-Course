Ok.. this movie has obviously caused some debate about the legend of joan of arc.  However, it seems obvious that debate was its intention.  I suppose there are those who honestly believe that joan was God's messenger.  And there are others who believe there must have been some other explanation. 
I think this movie can be described as the story of a girl who is so in love with god, and wants more than anything for him to be pleased with her, that she looks for his presence in everything that she encounters.  This love and desire for God is brought nearer to her, as she witnesses her sister's death and subsequent err.. violation.  She wants to know why the God she so loved would leave her alive, while taking her sister.  The obvious conclusion:  God needs her for something.  From this point, the film starts the portrayal of the historical Joan.  
Many things are brought into question, such as her motivation, the nature of her visions, and even the consistancy of her actions.  None of which are resolved to any specific conclusion, as far as i can see.  I don't believe there is any reason to assume that this film portrays Joan to be a lunatic.  It merely shows the character of Joan questioning herself about it, by means of her conscience (often humorously portrayed by Dustin Hoffman).  She questions her motives, as any right thinking moral christian would, after directly causing the deaths of so many people.  The conclusions that are drawn near the end of the film, are things that she comes to in her own mind, and nowhere is it stated that she was not sent by god to do her work.. only that she had personal motivation for it, and sometimes acted selfishly.  I came away from the film convinced even more that this was a woman with undeniable courage, unshakable faith, and truly, above all, a servant of the God that she spent her whole life trying to be closer to.  I feel that anyone who missed those points should see it again.
