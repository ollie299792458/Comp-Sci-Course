In brief, this is a story of a small group of English nuns working in India. The focus of the movie is on the inner struggle of the nuns to live a life of asceticism in an incredibly aesthetic surrounding. The movie was excellent even if the story could have been developed a little more. As a student of Christian theology and mysticism, I found it greatly intriguing, but any educated person should say the same.

I want to note that, yes, these nuns are Protestant not Catholic. To be specific, they are Anglicans who follow a branch of Anglicanism called "Anglo-Catholicism." The Anglo-Catholic movement was a movement within the Church of England in the 19th century to return the C of E to its roots in the early church and the medieval church. They promoted, among other things, a high view of the sacraments and the importance of ritual and beauty in the liturgy. Also, they affirmed the importance of the monastic life within the church, thus there are Anglican monks, friars, and nuns (albeit few). There is much more on the internet about Anglo-Catholicism: I'd recommend looking-up Project Canterbury (a website devoted to Anglo-Catholicism).
