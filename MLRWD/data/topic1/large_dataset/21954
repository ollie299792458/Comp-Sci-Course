I am very disappointed in WB for not putting out the extended editions.

To put the record straight, THERE IS AN EXTENDED CUT OF GOBLET OF FIRE!!!  Every time I watch ABC's Harry Potter weekend they add about 3-4 (or so, never counted) minutes of footage (i.e. Snape in the grounds during the Yule Ball talking with Karkarov and busting a couple in a car, Durmstrang students asking Hogwarts girls to the Yule Ball and bowing, etc)

So why is ABC family allowed to show this version if the director said he didn't want to do a director's cut?  He obviously already made one and these versions will be released in a year or two once the Potter Series wraps up and WB feels the need to milk a few extra bucks from the franchise.

Nothing in Prison of Azkaban, and I am all good with that, but to not release an extended cut of Goblet or Order when we know the footage is out there is insulting.

It's like the Special Extended Editions of Lord of the Rings, or Star Wars on dvd when George Lucas said he would never release the original versions on dvd, i bought the special editions, then two years later had to double-dip to buy the regular editions.

Why are the studios so intent on robbing us all blindly?  I own over 200 blu-rays, the format is really only 4-5 years old, and they're already doing re-releases on some of the title I bought a few years ago.  I feel ripped off, and I'm getting sick of it.
