For those of us who look back fondly on the good old days of science fiction, when movie setups were straightforward and understandable and didn't consume almost the whole movie, involuted puzzlers like this one may never be our favorite movies. We remember fondly those simple set ups that let us sit back and enjoy an edge-of-your-seat main body of the movie, culminating in a definitive ending. This more contemporary thriller is about an assassin sent from another solar system to kill a major world political leader on Earth. The way this assassin operates is to take over someone else's body and sneak in undetected under that person's identity. Things get really complicated when it becomes darned near impossible to tell if someone is his or her real self or an imposter assassin. It seems that all but the last minute or less of this film is setup. Then by the time the short climax comes, things are so contorted and ambiguous that the movie leaves us quite confused. Sometimes endings are ambiguous and that can be effective as a plot device. But when it's ambiguous as to whether things are even ambiguous or not, that leaves me longing a bit for the good old days. What does make this movie more satisfying that many another modern convoluted thriller is Gary Sinise's strong performance. Given the material he had to work with, he handles it at least as well as in some of his previous impressive roles, as in APOLLO 13 and FORREST GUMP. As the lead in this case, he keeps our interest, even as the plot at some times becomes exasperatingly elusive.
