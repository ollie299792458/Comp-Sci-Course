In this classic movie, I liked how realistic the shark seemed. Just as in "Moby Dick", man tries to conquer nature, in both cases a beast of the sea. This book may be taken to suggest that man can conquer nature, although incurring destruction in the process, but this is fictional story. In both stories, the beast means no intentional harm, that is just the result of its instinct. There are two technical errors in Jaws. It involves the initial harpooning of the shark to a barrel.  Even though Quint, an experienced seaman, notes upon the shark's first appearance that it is the biggest shark he's ever dealt with, he acts surprised when the shark submerges with one barrel and then with two barrels harpooned into him. After the first barrel is harpooned into the shark, it comes back at night and strikes the boat, with the barrel still on him. The next morning when the shark comes back, there is no barrel and no explanation for its absence. Those are just two minor errors in a great movie.
I found it ironic that Quint, the experienced seaman, the fearless S.O.B., is the only one of the three crew members who are killed by the shark. Also ironic is that the Chief of Police, the one least knowledgable about the sea and sharks and most afraid, ("You're gonna need a bigger boat") is the one who puts the shark to death.
This movie will be loved for a long time. The TV version has started to censor things it didn't before like swearing and violence, which I think detracts from the quality of the film. The sequels to Jaws just don't compare with the original.
