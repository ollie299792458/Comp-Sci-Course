Okay, so Arnold's not in it.  What's the big deal?  If Sigourney Weaver hadn't needed to be the star of the very very big universe that the "Alien" movies are set in, then THOSE flicks might not have gone so astray just halfway into the series.  Although Danny Glover has always been an excellent actor, the PREDATOR is the true star of these movies, and if there's one thing that both "Predator" films have established, it's that the Predators have been hunting on Earth for centuries.  "Predator 2" works very nicely as an expansion of the original concept (vs. being just another cheap knockoff with the same star for added marketability).  "Predator" is a concept which can span endless enviornments with endless characters, and I'm proud of the makers of "Predator 2" for taking advantage of that.  Taking the franchise to the big city of L.A. lends a dynamic that is wonderfully different from the first movie's more isolated jungle setting, and allows the story to be truly expanded by showing us more significant details about not only the hunting ethics of the Predators, but the fact that humans are aware of their presence and have (for years) been actively seeking to confront and capture them.  Rather than stagnating on the same old premise that was introduced in "Predator," "Predator 2" actually has the courage to evolve it (much like "Aliens" did for "Alien").  Sure, the basic idea is now familiar, and yes, the killings are more predictable and notably less suspense-inducing than in the original movie, but it's definitely a step in the right direction for the evolution of a fine movie series that hopefully has not ended here!
