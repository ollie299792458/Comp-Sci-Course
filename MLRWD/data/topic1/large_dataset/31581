I was really looking forward to watching this movie, yay, it came in the mail via netflix, the movie was interesting and drew you in, scary giant aliens, lots of action, lots of gross scenes with people getting eatin by the aliens, and their head ripped off, but the end, I was hoping the couple would make it and survive, but no, they got sucked into the mother ship, with more horrors to swait them, and visualize, then we tradgicly watch our poor leading mans head get ripped off, and inserted into an alien body, in which he then tries to protect his preggers girlfriend, then the movie just ends, WHAT???, again, WHAT???, what had I just seen, THIS WAS A HORRIBLE ENDING!!! when will these people get it, we want the people to survive and overcome, the aliens/horrors that befall them, cant we kick some alien butt too, just like Independance Day, we want to leave the movie with a smile and some kind of satisfaction, not ugh!!!, WHY, WHY??, BOO!!, and again, BOO!, then insult to injury, I went to watch the special features, which there was plenty, and of course I love commentaries, which this dvd also contains 2 commentaries, but when I went to click on all of the special features, and the 2 commentaries, I could not watch them!!, instead a message flashed on the screen, you cannot see any special features, as this is a rental, WHAT!, was this some kind of sick joke, is this the future, you now have to buy dvd/blue ray to watch special features, INSULTING!! AND PISSED ME OFF!! I not only had to endure a horrific ending, then I was slapped in the face, with  ha, you cant watch the special features, or hear the commentaries to understand why they went this direction with the ending, ugh, not happy, not happy at all.
