The movie itself was entertaining to watch. There were a few plot surprises but for the most part
it was pretty predictable. It was awesome to see cowboys and aliens in the same movie. The
movie focuses more on the cowboys and brings it down to earth with their individual human
stories. The characters were all believable. The aliens were pretty much just faceless bad guys.
They're just bad, there's really not much more to their characters. But that didn't matter too much
because we were watching humans either searching for redemption, changing their ways, or
becoming men.

The video was perfect looking. The scenery in this movie was beautiful. It had a lot more foliage
than other westerns that are pretty much out in the total wasteland desert. The surround sound
was extremely active and powerful. It was fun to listen to things happening in all the different
speakers.

The special features so far are really interesting. The interviews with Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford,
Spielberg, Olivia Wilde etc. were much longer than I thought they'd be. They are definitely not
the fluff internet interviews that tell you nothing.

Overall the movie was entertaining, but not amazing. I think I'm still coming to terms with how I
feel about the ending. It looks and sounds great on Blu-ray.

CONTENT NOTE: There is a scene that shows\implies what the aliens do to Daniel Craig's Character's wife when she is abducted that really troubled my mother.
