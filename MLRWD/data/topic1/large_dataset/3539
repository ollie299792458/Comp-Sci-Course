All I really have to ask is, "Why did it take so long for them to make a special edition for Raging Bull?"

Raging Bull is an American classic film that portrays the rise and self destruction of boxer Jake LaMotta (played by Robert Dinero).  Raging Bull is, in my opinion, regarded as great because it is tragic.  Most films of this sort will give you a happy ending where everyone is getting along in the end.  Raging bull, however, presents a more raw view of what can really happen.  Martin Scorsese does not shy away from showing us the violent and not so happy life that Jake LaMotta lead.  Also, Scorsese does a great job with the boxing scenes.  If you watch the shot-by-shot extra, you will see the extreme lengths that were taken for accuracy.

As for the extras, they are very good.  The disc two features are all worth watching.  The commentaries on disc one are pretty well done, but I was really hoping for one with Robert Dinero and Joe Pesci.  Despite this, Raging Bull is well worth your money.  Any movie fan must add this to their repertoire of DVDs.
