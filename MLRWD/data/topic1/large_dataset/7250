With the run of lackluster sci-fi flicks that came out one-after-another that year (Red Planet, Wing Commander, Super Nova, Battlefield Earth, Mission to Mars) -PITCH BLACK was bliss! Not that you are certain to agree... In fact, there's been a division of opinion on this movie. From what I've witnessed, you love it or hate it. I personally find that it rather easily takes it's place among my top-ten sci-fi favorites. And when you take into account its miniscule budget and unknown cast... this is quite a feat.
The plot could have used some tweaking, but the acting was quite solid, and I really enjoyed the characters, whose conflicts with each other (and within themselves) were engrossing. -Not to mention Vin Diesel, who makes a fine definition for the term "bad-...". Thanks to him, I found myself saying "whoa!" many times during this movie. He has quite a future ahead of him, I think, but his growl-of-a-voice (while very cool) needs captions -because you can't make out what he is saying at times.

The special effects were tasteful and in no way overdone -one of my biggest complaints in most sci-fi flicks. And although some found it too distracting, I thought the grainy camera filtering gave Pitch Black a nice gritty feel. It worked so well- I felt like I was trapped on the desert planet with them.
In short, this flick hit my buttons quite nicely! If you liked Aliens- Definitely give Pitch Black a shot!
