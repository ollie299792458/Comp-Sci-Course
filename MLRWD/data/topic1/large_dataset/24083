What happened to this Special Edition?  Amazon listed the release date as September 7, printed ads I saw listed it as September 7, and Paramount's website listed it as September 7!

As for the film itself, I loved it.  Although I would have liked to see both the classic & next generation crews all together, the story was good enough as it was.  Ever since I was a kid, Kirk has been a real hero - a larger then life character who, although flawed, could always rise above his situation and win.  This time, although he helps Picard win, he has given the ultimate sacrifice - his very life.

It is the way Kirk would - and had to - go.

As he pointed out to Picard, he had been 'saving the galaxy while you're grandfather was still in diapers'.  And save it yet again he does, tragically for the last time.

The film is a blast, and an excellent start for the Next Generation in movies.  Although some of the characters might be slighted there is every sense that 'the human adventure is just beginning'.
