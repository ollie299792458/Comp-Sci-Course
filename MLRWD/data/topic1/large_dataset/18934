I wasn't particularly impressed with this film. It's more like a mystery than a character study about the nature of love and betrayal: you'll be investigating whose words mean anything, looking for signs of true emotion.

We have four youngish, unattached people in the unfortunate, but hardly tragic, situation of being in relationships, but in fact "fancying" other people. For some odd reason, it doesn't occur to them to just simply leave the partner they are not interested in. One guy cheats on girlfriend for a year before he decides to leave her, one of the women actually marries a guy in the middle of her affair with another guy (don't want to give away the names here, it's part of the detective work).

The characters tell each other they love each other, while lying and cheating, so your detective work must go beyond the words. Another step could be to see who tells the truth to whom - perhaps that's a sign of true emotion. But one of the characters has no truth to tell (because he has no emotions I can detect) and another tells the truth to the guy she doesn't love.

Other reviewers called this a character study. True, there is no plot, but for an adapted play the characters are remarkably flat. Many talk about the brutal honesty of the film (yes, there is quite a bit of coarse language having to do with sex, but it doesn't bother me and I wouldn't categorize it as honesty), but there was only one split second when I, the viewer, was actually touched by what was going on on screen: the end of Larry and Anna's conversation in their apartment. Clive Owen is very good.

I investigated, figured things out and was left completely unmoved. In the mystery genre, I would have rated this film higher. In a character study about emotions, this was mediocre.
