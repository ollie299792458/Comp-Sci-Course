This is a retelling of Sir Walter Scott's epic of chivalry and knighthood. A lot depends on how you approach this and similar epics (e.g. Knights of the Round Table) from the Golden Age of Hollywood. 'Golden' is a suitable description of these epics because the colours are so brilliant and everything even the peasant's huts appear clean! The whole approach of directors like Thorpe and Michael Curtiz and the studios involved is to make the stories visually stunning and almost fairy tale like. Contrast this with the more graphic realism of Ridley Scott's 'Gladiator' or John Boorman's 'Excalibur'. The point being that for some audiences used to this more modern approach 'Ivanhoe' and other films from this period may seem artificial and tame but if your desire is to sit and watch a colourful, swash buckling movie with younger members of your family without worrying about unsuitable gore or sexual content then this is your kind of movie. Both Taylors are matinee idol gorgeous, George Sanders is suitably malevolent and supporting actors like Finlay Currie keep the standard high. Great fun!!
