Iron Maiden Videos of the past have often suffered from poor video or audio editing and rarely captured the energy of an Iron Maiden concert, but apparently those days are over.

Flight 666 hits you with some of the finest concert video ever captured by any band, and has the audio mix to back it up.  Thick and moody just like being there.  Steve Harris' bass will shake the dishes off your counter top if you've got the sound system to release it.

As always, Iron Maiden is just a fun group of guys to follow around, entertaining and candid interviews with all band members at various stages of the tour, and occasional comments from stage and support crew make for some of the best 2 hours you can buy if you're a fan of this band.

After 30 years, finally an Iron Maiden video that completely captures the essence, the energy, the massive sound, and the humor of the best rock band in history (my opinion, not theirs).

Even my non-metal friends have commented on what a great video this is, simply because it shows the humanity, and the pressure of putting together a tour of this scope... And in fact I've converted a couple non-Maiden friends into fans with only this Blu-ray.

If you're a fan, don't think twice.  If you're not a fan, hell, don't think twice, this will open your eyes to who this band, and their fans REALLY are.
