Nuclear weapons and opera.....one would probably think this an unlikely marriage and for certain, many people would say "Those two topics don't interest me, so why would I watch a documentary about such an opera?"  That's somewhat how I felt, yet this does turn out to be interesting viewing.  If you don't like documentaries a la "The History Channel" type DVDs, you probably won't like this movie. The opera, named Doctor Atomic, is about Robert Oppenheimer and the invention of nuclear bombs....the DVD is not the opera itself, but a documentary.  There is a decent portion of opera in it, but at heart it is a documentary.  The movie runs about an hour and a half.  I think the balance was right for me.....any more opera and I might have lost interest, but then I'm not an opera buff.

The opera, hence this documentary, covers the Manhattan Project, focusing on the final days leading up to the detonation of a nuclear bomb in New Mexico in 1945.

I found it enlightening, as it was an interesting and informative story that gives you a "behinds the scenes" look at the making of this opera, but in the end is really much more than that, providing an education on the development of the nuclear bomb.

Not being an opera buff, I cannot comment on the operatic portions other to say they were pleasant and would not deter me from watching the DVD again.  All in all, interesting viewing and certainly educational.
