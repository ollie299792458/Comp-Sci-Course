Although this movie is dated, it is an excellent motion picture.  Could this have been part of the motivation of the Cardinals to elect Pope John Paul II?  There are many parallels.  Coming from a communist country? The first non Italian Pope in many years?  Who can say maybe Morris West, the author, was prophetic.  There are differences.  The communist bishop Kiril Lakota is Eastern Rite, but that is to be expected if he is truly Russian.  The young priest Fr. David Telemond (Oscar Verner) who meets Quinn and brings him to the Vatican is an interesting character.  Some reviews likened him to Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, S.J. who had views similar to this young priest.  Leo McKern plays Cardinal Leone who is at first jealous of Kiril, but becomes his staunch ally after realizing Kiril's deep spirituality.  One scene I personally find facinating is one where Kiril "escapes" the confines of the Vatican and walks the city listening to the sounds of the street and taking in the smells coming from those cooking dinner.  He meets a doctor who asks him to fill a prescription and enters into a Jewish house.  Shocked to see a priest in their house and especially when he tries to give the dying man "Last Rites," the family announce their Jewish faith. Immediately Kiril begins to chant the "Kaddish" to the amazement of the man's family.  The movie is dated, but it is excellent.  The acting is excellent and cast superb. It is a must have for those who like religious movies especially those dealing with the Roman Catholic Church.
