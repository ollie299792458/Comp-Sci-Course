Allot can be said about the teen drama's that have ruled the airwaves for years now and here is my take of this teen drama. It seems to me that Roswell was trying to capitalize off the success of Dawson's Creek. Except this teen drama had a sci-fi twist. All in all this show was not half bad. It had it's hokey moment's and it had it's triumphs. Lead actress Shiri Appleby looked remarkably similar to Katie Holmes and the gorgeous Katherine Heigl used her looks and sex appeal often during the show just as Michelle Williams (Jenn Lindley) did in Dawson's Creek. The stand out performer in the show was William Sadler (Sheriff Valenti) which would not come as a surprise to anyone familiar with this actor and his work. The show takes some bizarre twists and ends up backing up on its self a time or two but was surprisingly entertaining. The complete three seasons is a bit of a wild roller coaster ride with quite a few surprises surprisingly. So you get the attractive cast with  Majandra Delfino who went from ugly and homely to knockout status in a span of a summer and the gorgeous Emilie de Ravin in her "Pre-Lost" days and the equally attractive male cast who actually did a fairly good job of acting. However this show was doomed from the beginning as the network and the creator/producers of the show could never agree which direction to take the show. This made for some fairly absurd story lines and abrupt endings to interesting story lines. This show was not sure what it wanted to be. But yet...it is a bit of a guilty pleasure in it's own right. The first season was the best and the show was fair to decent from then on with a bit of a disappointing series finale.
