I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and still can't stop thinking about it.  It reminds me of "Citizen Ruth" because it blasts not just the chicken hawks, but everyone on the other side as well.

First of all, let me just say, Malcolm Tucker.  Remember the "Blown Away Guy" ads for Maxell cassettes: a guy in a leather jacket wearing long hair and sunglasses sits in a chair facing a speaker.  His hair and necktie are wind-blown like he's in front of a wind turbine. (You can find him on YouTube, or on the package for Maxell UR tapes they sell on Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087NBW">Maxell UR-90 Blank Audio Cassette Tape, 7 Pack</a>.)  That's what it feels like to watch Peter Capaldi play Malcolm in this movie -- he's a torrent of bile.  Malcolm doesn't seem to care if or why we start a war, as long as everyone toes the line.

And for the other reviewers who object to the language in this movie: you know, I HAVE heard cursing in other movies and when it's lazy and done for cursing's sake, it's just boring.  These writers and actors elevate it to an art form.  One of the best jokes in the movie is that the biggest war-monger can't stand foul language.  That one and the line about lubricated horse anatomy.

Of course, the cruelest joke is that most of these political hacks are too busy worrying about moving up the ladder to be concerned whether young kids are going to die in a war (well, except for Simon, and he's still a tool).  If you're working in the State Department or a company that makes paper clips, office politics are the same.  You'll meet the same venal backstabbers wherever you go.

Can't wait to see it again.
