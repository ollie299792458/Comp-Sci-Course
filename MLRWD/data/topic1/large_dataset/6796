Although we are British and now living back in the UK, my 3 and a half year old son was born in the US and has avidly watched Baby Einstein from about two weeks old, (it was always guaranteed to calm him down during a tantrum within seconds).  When his sister was born early last year I got out all the old BE DVDs for her and my son has watched them again and again with her, so I was delighted to find a DVD had been made aimed at older children.  I must say Little Einstein has not failed to disappoint either my son or I, he watches it over and over again, we've had it for about a month now and I would say he wants it on about 3 to 6 times a week, (and he is in school 4 days!).  His school does a lot of music when they get to about 6 or 7 years old so I hope this will give him both a head start and encourage his interest.  He's also travelled a lot and loves looking at a map of the US while the DVD is playing, following the butterfly migration in the story, (as well as pointing out where he was born and places he's visited!). I highly recommend this DVD and look forward to there being another one available soon.
