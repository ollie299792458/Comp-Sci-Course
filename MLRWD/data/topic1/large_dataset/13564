This movie follows the lives of various individuals who were involved in the guerrilla war in Missouri and Kansas during the Civil War.  It is told from the southern point of view and examines the wide range of people who were involved, from the immigrant's son who was caught up primarily due to his friendships, to the rabid, bloodthirsty types who seemed to thrive on the violence and everyone in between.  The movie was shot on location in western Missouri where many of the events took place.  For anyone who is a Civil War enthusiast this movie is a must see.

Ang Lee did a great job of taking people I would ordinarly be opposed to in real life and making me care what happened to them.

As is often the case, the movie takes a few liberties with historical accuracy.  For instance, there really wasn't a battle with Federal cavalry following the burning of Lawrence, but the depiction of guerilla warfare and how the participants lived and acted in real life is very accurate from what I've read on the subject.
