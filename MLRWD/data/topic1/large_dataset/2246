I was actually surprised at the fact that I liked this movie. I'm not much for docudrama type movies, and if I'm watching one it usually has something to do with a subject I am interested in. Politics does not fall into this category. But, upon hearing of a George Bush documentary, the first thing that popped into my mind was, "I wonder if he says misunderestimate?" I was not disappointed. It went through his asinine years (that is, birth-end of presidency), but it kind of cleared up a few things for me. He might have been an alright president (in the public's eye) if 9/11 and all the war hadn't happened. I mean, c'mon, there is no way to get popular vote during a war. Unless you are able to defeat them single-handedly with no casualties while finding the cure for AIDS.
But, I digress. This movie was a rather enjoyable viewing for me. Josh Brolin did a fairly good job portraying him. Ears weren't big enough, though. Anyways, if nothing else, go give it a rent, pay per view, something of that sort.
