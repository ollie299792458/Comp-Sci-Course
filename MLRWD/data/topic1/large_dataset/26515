I was very fortunate to watch this movie on a VHS bootleg back in 1986, when Brazilian video rentals were fantastic candy stores filled with forbidden fruit from all over the world.

With a nice touch of abandoned dogs gone wild on the outskirts of a big city, Suburbia is a candid movie, honest to the core, about US belated punk generation, vaguely akin if still indebted to its UK predecessors. Sadly, it was Amerika's last dissent generation, the last one to have the guts before this breed of new conservatism took over completely. Watching this movie, one cannot but raise his hat as the last brave ship of fools sinks. Beautiful. Together with Repoman (a far more sophisticated and entertaining movie from the same period, which also echoes US punk angst), Suburbia is a memento of the USA I used to love.

Ironically, both movies are owned by two major American studios which today would never ever risk financing anything even remotely as quirky and uncompromising.

P.S. - As far as I know, Suburbia is from 1984, not 1982 as stated by Amazon.com.
