I loved this movie!  I had read the book 3 times and was always disappointed the the Stanley Kubrick's version strayed so far from the the book.  I was happy when this version came out because it was truly like seeing the book come to life.  It is quite a long movie (approx 3 hrs, 2 discs) but I have watched multiple times and enjoy it every time.  I actually got to go to the hotel where it was filmed in Estes Park, CO and take the ghost tour and see where Stephen King thought up this chilling story.

The movie is about a recovering alcoholic that takes a job as a caretaker of the Outlook Hotel (truly known as The Stanley Hotel, Estes Park, CO) with his family over the winter.  The hotel has its secrets that the son has a intuition about and can "see" the visions of them.  They call the visions "the shining".  The resident ghosts start to make their presence known through the father as they prey on his weakness as a recovering alcoholic and sort of make him go crazy and want to kill his family.  Due to the fact that it is winter time the family cannot escape easily so it truly becomes a hide and seek game.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a chilling ghost story.
