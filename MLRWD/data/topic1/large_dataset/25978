While Kevin Smith's basic premise behind his critically accalimed debut film is very formulaic, in it being a buddy flick, it is the way he does it that makes it a classic. As qouted in his newest dvd "An Evening With Kevin Smith" he says, "In my world, everyone has really long conversations about interesting [stuff] or just pick apart pop cultur to death and everyone talks in monologue,". That quote perfectly describes Clerks more than any othe Kevin Smith movie as whether they are talking about their sex life, Star Wars, or annoying costomers, they do it in not only an intellectual way but do it indirectly. Another high point of the movie is the social issues he tries to tackle, as even though he is a smoker, he makes a point about people's isues with smoking going as far as having a four year old succesfully buying ciggarettes at a point. Also, compared to other Kevin Smith movies there is less fart jokes. Overall, while the movie is great the extras are what makes this dvd. Even though Kevin Smith plays a quiet character in his movies, he is the complete opposite as he always talks and talks very informatively about everything. While the actual movie looks bad the deleted scenes are worse but are still entertaining. Especially the alternate ending as it is completely unlike Kevin Smith. Overall, get the dvd
