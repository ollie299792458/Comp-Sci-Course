In this third installment, Ethant Hunt tries to get hitched, and even his co-worker IMF crew knows that not the kind of life you need when your doing a job like this, but Ethan Hunt believes in honesty and learns that he can't even keep his true secret job from his beloved new wife when the eneny captures her and uses her as leverage to get to Ethan by getting what he wants, which is the Rabbbits Foot, which is a deadly explosive device that could wipe out all human living on the planet.

Like always its a thrilling and crazy stunt action that makes you grab your seat or book because you know there might be a chance that Ethan Hunt might die this time...I dont think so. LOL

This mission impossible was a wake up call for Ethan Hunt to get back into the field since he had been off active duty since the last Mission impossible, and was occupied training new IMF recruits, as Ethan has found out, the terrorists and all the other bad guys have changed over the years.

Great movie, a fine collection to include with MI- 1 and 2!

Will there be a MI-4?, I hope so! Tom Cruise is starting to show his age!, Better make another movie soon before they start hiding those gray hairs on his head.
