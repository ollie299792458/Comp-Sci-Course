Are you ever bothered when a person does not answer a question you ask? How about if they don't even acknowledge your existence like your presence is void? This feeling of which I meditate upon is exhibited by Dustin Hoffman's character in "Sphere" perfectly after his crew mates start going into "The Sphere" one after another. To truly enjoy this film, put yourself in the shoes of Dustin Hoffman, who is accompanied by other researchers but who is essentially alone once his compatriots are mentally transformed into simpler humans. The one crew member who has these effects down to a T is Samuel L. Jackson whose transformation is drastic from the well-mannered scientist to the overly happy crew member who almost becomes more of a liability than an asset to the crew. All the while monsters are aloof, striking at the crew in various awful ways. And if that's not great enough, just the idea of Queen Latiffa being killed by sea monsters just makes my funny bone tingle, hilarious. I say see this film, it is an enjoyable watch and certainly an eyebrow-raiser of the scientific sorts.

P.S.- Did anyone else really want to read 20,000 Leagues under the sea really badly after watching this film?
