Don't read any reviews but this one, too many of them stupidly (to appear in the know?) give the plot away, and all do it badly.  I guess everyone does see the same accident differently.  I really dislike people who call movies "excellent."  It's so affected.  But this flick was EXCELLENT.  It's less than 90 minutes long (I like short movies) which is enough, perfectly enough, wonderfully, tautly, excitingly written, and almost as deep as you can get after "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" (but don't let that nasty word "deep" turn you off).  The 3 principles are wonderful.  The guy was just sleazy enough, the young girl just sociopathic enough and Channing was perfection. And she can bark out the f-word with wonderful impact.  (Does the expression "f-word" tell you what word without telling you what word?  Prudery!  Phooey!)  It's a great flick, I may buy a copy of it, don't let anyone's synopsis spoil it for you, it does not begin where one "reviewer" says it does, it does not end the way another "reviewer" says it does and contrary to a 3rd "reviewer," there are no slow or dragging places it.
