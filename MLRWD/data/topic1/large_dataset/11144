When I read the reviews of "Scary Movie 2" I wonder..... DID THESE PEOPLE SEE THE SAME MOVIE I DID????? This movie was so not funny. The jokes all had to do with bodily functions, sex, and very tasteless other things. I guess that in order to make a few teens laugh, the only thing you have to do in a movie is make vomit, farts, and bowel movements the center of your story. I did not laugh for most of this movie. I will admit that there were some funny parts, but not very many. I was a very big fan of the first Scary Movie and had high hopes that this one could be as fresh and funny as the original. Apparently the best that the Wayans brothers could do was to use some of the same sight jokes as before (yes I will spoil it and say that Cindy does get splashed to a wall again with the "fluids of love") Unfortunately this was already used in the first Scary Movie and was not necessary for the next one. Is this to be a Scary Movie trademark such as Arnold's "I'll be back" line was for most of his movies? Let's hope that Dimension Films will realize that the Wayans brothers have pumped their wells dry and have no more funny things to say. Let's put the money into more creative and original funny movies. Not ... like this.
