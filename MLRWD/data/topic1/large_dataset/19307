I had forgotten how enjoyable this movie is, and with added scenes, it is better the 2nd time around.  My favorite scene in the movie is John Lee Hooker, this version has the complete BOOM BOOM, as raw as you will ever hear blues short of Maxwell treet and Robert Nighthawk, the extra little additions makes The BLUES BROTHERS grittier, more musical, speaking of which, I didn't expect the sound track to be much, man was I wrong.. its as good if not better then many new DVD's I have, much better. Kudo's to the engineer.  Did you know Jack Nicholson was in the front row during the great stage performance with Cab Calloway and The Blues Brother band.  Incidently, you probably know that the members are real bona-fide musicians, some playing with Paul Butterfield, Sleepy Le'beef, on and on. I saw Hooker many times but never with this raw  Maxwell sound which is where he is playing, take a good look, most of Maxwell Street has been mowed down, too bad, Muddy Waters, Houston Stackhouse, Howlin' Wolf.. most of the icons payed there dues on Maxwell Street.  I'm not a big R&B fan, Dirty ole' nasty junky blues is my occupation and enjoyment, but, the combination of styles give the R&B a back bone that you won't hear any place else and with Belushi and Ackroid together, it is up there with any combinations of comedians from the Marx Brothers to the THREE STOOGES with a sound track of juicy tunes.. listen to what I say.. I'm On A Mission From Gawd.
