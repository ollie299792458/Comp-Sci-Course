First, it's just cool they used cats as the animal in this film.  what other animal would be able to play jazz in such a swingin' way.  but seriously, did you notice how every cat was of a different heritage? Dutchess and the kittens, French, O'Maley (Irish) ... who had an incredibly long name (Abraham D'Lacy Geocept Percacey Thomas O'Maley, O'Maley the Alley Cat), which Dutchess noted "covered all of Europe."  When we're introduced to his friends, we have a Fats Domino type chubby gray trumpet playin' "Scat Cat."  The bass player's from Eastern Europe, Russia perhaps or in the 70s would have been USSR?  The hippy guitar playing cat with big glasses and beads, the possibly Swiss cat on accordian.  They're all "cats" but of different places, all jamming and all linked to O'Maley enjoying life together.  As this movie was comin' out of the late 60s, Disney's showing America that anyone, from where ever they're from or however they talk, can all be friends and hang out.  Unfortunately, they give the British a hard time, with the fun loving gabbin' geese who inform the audience that in being british, they aim to "keep things proper."  The butler, too, was British, I believe.  Poor guys.  Not only that love everyone and have a ball attitude comes off the screen, but the movie also encourages practicing and teaching the arts-painting, piano, singing (even with the proper syllables!  ("do me sol do re fa la it goes.... when you play your scales and your arpeggios....") what a cartoon!
