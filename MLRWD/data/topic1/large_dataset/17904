A shocking movie.  George Brent plays a drunken bum with a shady past.  He takes advantage of a pathetic, very confused, borderline psychotic girl young enough to be his granddaughter.  This is regarded as noble and beautiful, despite the fact that the child obviously needs psychiatric care, not a drunken, lecherous old man slobbering all over her (their scenes together are nauseating).  The leader of the region, played by Maria Ouspenskaya, rewards Brent by taking him on as one of the planners of the new state after the devastation, because she has "faith in him."  Why?  He's a drunken, disgusting old pervert.  Brent's former girlfriend, Myrna Loy, who apparently has had a few boyfriends, but is nowhere near as reprehensible as Brent, is presented as the epitome of evil.  He is a saint, she is a sinner.  Ouspenskaya demands that Loy be thrown out of the country, despite the fact that Loy has totally reformed and is working day and night in the hospital helping flood and plague victims.  My, what a bad girl!  Shame on her!  She must be punished!  Of course - - spoiler alert - - she has to die (but not before she has blessed the union of Brent and his childfriend), so everything turns out okay and India is saved from wicked women and made safe for child molester perverts.
