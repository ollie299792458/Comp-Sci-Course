Call it what you want--a horror movie, a psychological thriller, an anti-war film--but after seeing this film, there is much more behind the blood-drenched trenches and the rotting corpses.

At the end of the film, it's clear that this movie is more than a simple hack and slash film. Sure, it takes place during WWI, and sure, there's something creepy out there that is scaring the crap out of these guys. But more importantly, hidden behind these gruesome images is a movie about judgment. Borrowing some ideas from "The Sixth Sense," the company of soldiers are already dead when they come across the French trench. While stuck in the trench, one by one the men become insane and even start killing each other. When one of them is left, he is pulled underground to find all of his dead friends sitting around a fire and playing cards as if nothing had ever happened. When the last surviver sees himself sitting around the fire, he exlaims "No! I'm not dead!" and finds a way out with the help of the French soldier that he helped save. He climbs his way out of the trench and into a thick fog.

It is clear that the trench was Limbo for these soldiers. They were all tested, and each one of them failed, and were pulled into the ground. The pure heart of the main character saved him from his judgment, which is why he was led up the ladder, and out of the trench. This movie may have been played up and disguised as a horror film, but there are hidden meanings galore that when spotted, leave the viewer very satisfied with this creepy, albiet low budget, horror film.
