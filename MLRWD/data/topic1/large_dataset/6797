This is exhiliarating filmmaking. Gorgeously shot and masterfully directed, Martin Scorsese teams up with screenwriter Paul Schrader to create a tale simliar (yet strikingly different) from their first collaboration, the amazing 'Taxi Driver'. Comparisons between the two films are inevitable: both have lead characters near the point of breaking who patrol the streets nightly (De Niro is a taxi cab and here, Nicolas Cage in an ambulance) briefly walking into people's live, each unable to connect with anyone. Cage's character spends each night patroling the streets of New York City, trying desperately to save lives but failing. He has been on a bad streak, patients seem to keep dying on him. He is haunted by the ghost of a young girl who shows up in front of his eyes, almost constantly, asking 'why did you kill me?'. He is assigned to increasingly unhinged partners (John Goodman, Ving Rhames, and Tom Sizemore... all perfect), begs to be fired, and falls for the daughter of a stroke victim (Patricia Arquette, convincingly torn and broken). It is a harrowing film, complete with many grisly scenes, and could easily be the most depressing film ever made. But Scorsese has other plans. The film is very much about redemption and salvation. About saving one's soul and how hard it is to do just that. Carrying us through it all is Nicolas Cage's wonderful performance, a walking time-bomb fueled by guilt and lonliness. The DVD edition is super-light on extras. No commentary track, just a few trailers and interviews. But the startling picture quality is enough to warrant it's purchase. A film this alive and hallucinatory benefits from the clarity of DVD. This is Scorsese's finest work outside of his usual ganster foree and should be seen by his fans and non-fans alike. It is a nightmare of a dream come true.
