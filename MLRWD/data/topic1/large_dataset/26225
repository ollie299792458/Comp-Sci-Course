When they talk about the golden age of Hollywood pirate movies, this is the movie they're talking about. 26-year-old Errol Flynn stars as a compassionate surgeon wrongly accused of treason and condemned to indentured slavery in the West Indies, where he leads the other brutalized slaves to steal a ship and take to piracy to survive, the only means of livelihood and liberty open to them. This idea of oppressed men choosing the sea over a life of servitude is historically realistic and emotionally stirring.

The youthful Flynn (so early in his career he has not yet grown his trademark pencil-thin moustache) commands the screen in the role that made his name synonymous with romantic swashbuckling. He's as stirring in the shipboard action (and there's plenty of it) as he is soulful in the dramatic scenes.

Unfortunately, the lovely Olivia De Havilland is stuck playing the standard pirate movie heroine: the disapproving noble lady flouncing around in her petticoats while the men go off and have all the fun. She's spirited enough in her compassion for Blood, the slave, and her rebuke of Blood, the pirate. But women with red blood in their veins will long to see a gutsier, less conventional heroine winning the outlaw captain's heart. Still, for its complex characters, thoughtful plotting and cinematic dash, this classic should be numero uno in everyone's pirate movie archive.
