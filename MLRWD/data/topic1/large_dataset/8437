To give this less than 5/5 would be downright mean. In a world where a mass-produced urinal is the most significant work of art of the century, and a paint-spattered piece of canvas is worth $140 million, this masterpiece has to be recognized as one of the greatest and most dramatic works in movie history. The story is sheer magic: tragic, touching, wistful, it has a meaning all of its own. It is an eloquent, elegant summary of the human condition. Where are we heading? And why? Who is there to help and guide us? And how will the fish factory in Des Moines carry on without us? A boy, a girl, unrequited love: the old, old story.  Thank heaven there is always someone either less, or more, intelligent than ourselves, who either does, or doesn't, know the score. Who can remind us how to forget. The silhouettes of the legionnaires at sunset were downright poetic. The misfits of humanity, caught up among the squads of the regimented, are poignant, yet heroic, souls. The spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes. And what unfathomable genius did it take to dream up a horse with its moustache growing over and above its nose?  Eat your heart out, Salvador Dali. Back off, Bunuel. When the sands of time run out, that harvest moon will still be shining over the desert.  We shall not see its like again. PS. I laughed quite a lot.
