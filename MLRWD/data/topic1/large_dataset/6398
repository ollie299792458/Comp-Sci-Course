I must say that you don't have to be from the sixties to love this movie (I was born in '85). This movie captures the innocence of childhood and the bliss of ignorance being taken away by war (Vietnam in this case- Iraq in today's world). This is the first time I have ever experienced "Hair," and I hope that it won't be my last! John Savage is perfect as Claude- he tries to act dignified and thinks himself above the group of hippies, but really he has a lot to learn about life. Treat Williams shows a stunning performance as Berger (the last ten minutes of the movie made me cry! Why BERGER?!). The movie shows an "innocent" America being dragged through the mud by a war that shows everyone how real death is. There are some very funny parts like when Berger and his friends sneak into a high class, rich party, and the song "Hair" is wonderful, and also the song about white boys and black boys was very funny. If you don't cry at the end of the movie, I will be very surprised! The choreography in the movie is breath taking and the music wonderful. The DVD is ok but not exceptional because it doesn't have that many extras. The Special Features contain an "Original Theatrical Poster Gallery" in which you can browse through different posters for the movie, and there is also the "theatrical trailer." If you don't want to buy the DVD, I highly recommend at least renting it like I did! I'm thinking about buying it now. VERY BEAUTIFULLY DONE!!!
