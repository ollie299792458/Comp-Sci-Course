"Assault on Precinct 13" is essentially what it sounds like, a blaze of bullets and blood. This isn't the best film of the year, but it certainly could've been worse.

Updated from John Carpenter's film of the same name, "Assault" deals with an understaffed, isolated police station that goes under seige on its last day. The film deals with the simplest goal of all: let's just try and survive. The cast is pretty impressive, Ethan Hawke, Laurence Fishburne, Brian Dennehy, and as I expected, Fishburne was the best part. His acting still has a bit of that post-Morpheus tint to it, but it didn't seem horribly out of place. It's still fun to watch him perform, but let's hope that he doesn't stay in the same spot forever.

I'm not trying to say that "Assault" is a mindless shoot-em-up. It comes close, but it's not totally mindless. It attempts to create characters with clear motivations, a feature lost in the earlier Carpenter version, and the "New Years" theme of change is pretty interesting. The plot does zig-zag a bit, however. Finally, my big complaints are that the characters curse way too much and the director seems to have fallen in love with the shot of a character with a bloody hole in the middle of the forehead. By the fourth time, I was wondering if the director had forgotten he had a similar shot three times before.

"Assault on Precinct 13" could be considered an update or a remake. Either way, it doesn't really gain much ground over Carpenter's version. As films, they're essentially the same: entertaining, but without much substance.
