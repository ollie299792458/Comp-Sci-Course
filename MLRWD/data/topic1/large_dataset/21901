After reading the reviews of this movie I was expecting an action packed thrill ride.  But sadly I was left very disapointed.  To add more salt to the wound I am now out $18.  The description says, "A modern throwback to the "B" movie exploitation films of the 50's-70's, mixing beautiful women, fast cars, big guns, nasty tongues, outrageous action, and jaw-dropping eye candy."  Beautiful women yes.  Fast cars no where to be found, no car chases.  Outrageous action, I've seen more of that watching two monkeys throw feces at each other.

The majority of the movie takes place at one spot in the desert.  Every 10 to 15 mins there is a flashback that looks like it is shot in front of a green screen, which really makes the movie look cheap, and gets very annoying. While I enjoy watching scantily clad women running around throwing buckets of water on eachother I would probably get more of a plot watching a soft core porn.

I'm no movie critic but I know a good movie when I see one, and this movie sucks.  Biggest movie dissapointment I have ever experienced.  Whoever wrote the reviews below must have something to do with the movie.  You want a good throwback movie watch Grindhouse, and Plant Terror.  If you still must see the movie send me a message and I'll sell it to you.
