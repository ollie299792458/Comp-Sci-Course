The movie is beautiful. I loved it. Really! The story line (described above) is pretty far-fetched, but the characters are believable and call our deep compassion and understanding into an active participation. Aristotle would have loved the possibilities for catharsis in this film!

My only lament is that they desperately needed to hire a good dance coach. The dancing is mediocre--at best. Even worse, there are many obvious errors a good dance coach would have caught: teaching triple rhythm swing and calling it Lindy-hop; teaching slow waltz, and then playing a Viennese waltz while they danced slow waltz; etc. I'll stop picking at it before I ruin it for you...

Two points of redemption keep this high on my dance movie list: The characters find and vocalize a passion for dance. Every serious dancer or dancer want-to-be will identify with the "I need my dancing" aspect of this film. Second, there is a wonderful picture of a go-a-second-mile sort of forgivenness that calls us all to be gracious and good to one another.
