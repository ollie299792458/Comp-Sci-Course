Like every Pretty in Pink fan I was excited about the up coming release of the Pretty in Pink Everything's Duckie Edition, the previous DVD edition was lacking in any features. More over I thought I would finally see the much talk about original ending with Duckie and Andie Dancing to "Heroes" by Bowie; well even thought the packaging says "THE ORIGINAL ENDING: The Lost Dance" in big bold letters, this is not the case. The only thing they show of the original ending is footage of them shooting the original ending and brief bits footage at that, the rest is just the actors and the director talking about the original ending. TALK? Is the footage lost? After all the hype online about finally being about to see the original ending and some very deceptive packaging this is a huge let down. I am happy to see this movie get a better DVD treatment, but the other great features on the disc seem over shadowed by this lacking feature that seemed promised. If this is the only reason you are planning on updating your disc is to have the original ending, be warned, if you want interviews with the cast and director than the DVD delivers.
