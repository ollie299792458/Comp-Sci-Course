I've watched most of Segal's films, and I own several as well. But this film is one of the worst films I've seen in the last ten years. Excepting for a chance to look at Jacqueline Lord (a Catherine Zeta Jones look, act, and dress alike) for a little while, and her acting wasn't very good most of the time, there are no redeeming aspects to this film.

For a film in the action genre, it consists of ALL bad elements.  The plot actually had potential, except the dialog is on the level of a bad High School film.  Segal is so over-weight that you can tell he's struggling to do even the most basic martial arts sequences.  Unless he can lose weight and get into shape, this is the last film of his I'll spend any time watching.

Unfortunately, the sets, the action, the dialog, the acting, the directing, and so forth, are all between the D+ to C levels of quality.

I'd rather have seen a corny Kung Fu movie. At least there would have been some excuse for so many bad elements in one film.

Avoid this film totally.
