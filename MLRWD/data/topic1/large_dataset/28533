I thoroughly loved Stieg Larsson's MEN WHO HATE WOMEN, but feared a movie version of it would probably be butchered. I am thrilled that this was not the case. THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is an excellent adaptation, and Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth is eerily accurate in her portrayal as a brilliant, somewhat naive, vulnerable, computer-hacker with a haunted past, and a core that's stronger than steel. The direction, cinematography, and overall acting is top-drawer as well. In fact, Michael Nyqvist as a rail-roaded journalist is nearly as good as Rapace. Of course, a few people will be put off by actually having to read subtitles, but after watching Rapace's performance I can't really picture anyone else as Larsson's heroine ( Hollywood, has to try though... ).

There is plenty of suspense, a superb plot, and a pretty satisfying conclusion in this first movie in the series. This is not a movie for kids. There is nudity, and more than a bit of torture, with some gruesome murder thrown in.
