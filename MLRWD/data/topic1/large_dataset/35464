I read the play for a project in theater and fell in love with the characters. Rosencrantz is a loveable, naive man who really can't figure anything out and Guildenstern analyzes the smallest of details and makes everything more confused (but you love him anyway). Since Hamlet is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays I thought Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead would be a pretty interesting play to read. I was wrong. It was wonderful.

And when I heard that Stoppard directed a film version, I had to watch it. I waited for months until it was on tv and I've been obsessed ever since. Oldman is a genius and he plays Rosencrantz as if he was born to play the part. Roth is great as the dominant, ever analyzing partner and Dreyfuss is brilliant as the Player who actually seems to be the only one in the whole thing that knows what's happening.

If you've read the play, go watch this! It will make the play make even more sense (if that's possible due to the general confusion that exists) and if you've seen the movie go read the play because some of the best conversations between Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have been left out.
