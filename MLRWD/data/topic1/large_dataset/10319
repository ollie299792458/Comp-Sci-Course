OK, here's the thing, I'm sat on a Jumbo Jet flying to Toronto on business and I see that on my DVD player I can watch a whole heap of films. I normally have a rule about not watching anything that I may want to watch on the cinema when flying on a plane because of the small screen but I saw 'Bruce Almighty' and thought "What the heck". I am soooo glad I did. Jim Carrey hasn't been this funny since... Well... Ever! This film was written for him through and through, playing up to his stregnths, and using his talents to the max. OK so the ending is slightly cheesy, but hey Its a family movie (although has a few swears in there). I thought this film would suck... But it really didn't, it is my surprise hit of the summer, and I recommend that anybody that HAD considered going to see it/rent/buy but didn't because of some bad press, should re-consider, you won't be dissapointed. I guarantee many many laugh out loud moments!!
That's me done... What are you still here for... Go rent it... Go on...
