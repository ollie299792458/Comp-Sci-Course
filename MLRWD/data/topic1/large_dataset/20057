I was fully prepared to dislike this movie since my only reason for watching it was Jensen Ackles. Shallow I know but I'm a Supernatural fan and I even watched 'Devour' which was horrible. To be honest I wasn't very optimistic since my last animated Batman was 'Batman-the animated series' and I'm an anime fan, meaning I dislike the animation style of most american productions.

BUT I LOVED IT!
The animation: There were a few car chases which looked too simplistic and too computer clean but the rest was a joy to watch. The fight scenes were impressive, my favorite one was definitely the Red Hood against the four asassins, the character desgin was great and the overall atmosphere was very dark and moody. It's a shame that they didn't go beyond a PG-13 release and did a more bloody, realistic death scene but you definitely get the feeling that they were trying to include as much blood as possible.

The voices: I didn't watch anything besides 'Batman - the animated series' so it didn't bother me that they had different voice actors for this Batman movie. I liked Batman's voice, LOVED the Joker's and the Red Hood's and although he played a very very minor part,I loved Nightwing, he had just the right amount of ligtness and humor to counter the darkness of Batman and the Red Hood.

I liked this movie so much that I finaly dared to watch other DC/WB movies like 'Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths' (Great animation but horrible voices for Batman and Superman), 'Superman/Batman: Public enemies' (great voices but horrible animation) and 'Batman/Superman World's Finest' (great voices and good animation). I have to admit that 'The Red Hood' is my clear favorite since it did a great job with the animation and the voice acting.

So please more Batman movies like this one!
