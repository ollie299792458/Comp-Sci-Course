This is a movie of a bygone era. Today the plots are all either paper thin or incredibly complex, but they give you enough clues to figure it out. This movie is so complex and has so many twists it is awesome but you might don't feel like it is handed to you. This is a product of a bygone era and the car chases are the best since bullet. Realistic yes, the stunt drivers knew their stuff and they performed excellently. The shooting is done quite realistically, and the guns are interesting and exotic (foreign) as well. It is cool too, to see Europe but a different view than most, we see some of the slums and regular parts of Europe. All-in all this is an amazing movie with a great plot, great acting, and great action. This is not for the casual Hollywood inaccurate action/suspense flick guy. Well, this is for everyone; but those who know stuff about guns won't be disappointed because there are no inaccuracies. Those disappointed by the surreal car crashes in Hollywood, will find solace here, with three realistic ones. Those that hate the paper thin plots will feel alive with this movie. Two-huge thumbs up!
