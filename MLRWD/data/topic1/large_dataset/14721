For the sake of space and time, I'll limit this review to what I consider the best of the Airport quartet, Airport 1975.

  The plot is summarized in multiple reviews surrounding this one... no need for further repetition. As for the production, it's full of over-acting and hyperbolic machismo. Unexplainably, this compliments and enhances the action. The cinematography is wonderful. The action and the human drama are cartoon-like, but the classic adventures of the screen are always a flesh and blood reflection of cartoons. In that light, I have no problem with Sister Helen Reddy singing a syruppy Up-With-People ballad to a sick little girl.
  The special effects are as convincing as props from a Broadway stage, but such was the standard in 1974. The under-achieving reality of the rear-projected mid-air pilot transfer is somehow endearing in its simplicity, and is a welcome refuge from modern eye-busting super-busy computer graphic overkill.
  Speaking of eye-busting, the Terminal Pack version is missing at least a few frames of film. In the scene where Karen Black is in the cockpit holding the Captain's discarded coffee cup, I recall her looking into the cup to discover a bloody eyeball. This explains two things... #1 why there is a scene of her holding the cup... #2 the look of disgust on her face in said scene. Granted, I'm relying on memory from viewing the original release in 1974 as a 12 year old kid. I reckon 12 year olds find severed eyeballs quite memorable.
  All spoofs and criticisms aside (just and otherwise), Airport 1975 is a film that offers a rewarding avenue of escape. That's what good movies do.
  As for extras, there is the theatrical preview, and that's it. Be thankful for that much, considering this DVD set is from Universal, the fortress of young suit-and-tied corporate sharks who could care less about historic cinematic artifacts and such.
