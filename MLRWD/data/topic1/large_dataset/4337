When I think of the most impressive coming-of-age movies, Say Anything and Wild Reeds (95,French) will always come into my mind first. Both movies are so truthful, realistic and deliver the emotion in such a natural way with  quiet but amazing depth.
I checked out Say Anything without knowing  anything about it, and ended it up with such a pleasant surprise and became  a Cusack fan ever since. The more I watch it, the better I feel about it.  
Made in 1989, I found this movie not only a stand out in 80s teen  movies, but also exceeded most 90s teen movies. This is a movie I can watch  over and over again without getting bored. Sadly say, most 90s teen movies  are only worth seeing once.
The break up scene is one of the most  touching ones in its genre. "I feel like crying... She gave me a pen,  I gave her my heart, she gave me a pen." Cusack made Lloyd one of the  remarkably endearing roles in all teen movies.  Lloyd is far from a hero,  he is a "champion mediocrity" (Diana's Dad's quote) who has no  career goals except being a kickboxer.  Normally this kind of guy can not  win my heart.  However, Cusack made LLoyd an awesome one. He made her  laugh, he pointed out the glass for her to walk around, he said the thing  that he really meant it,...I never realized that all those trivia can be so  powerful to a girl until I watched Say Anything. 
"One question: you  are here coz you need someone or coz you need me? ... forget it, I don't  care."
A must see!
