I purchased several movies from this vendor, last year when I was in the Army...big mistake. Each movie that I purchased claimed to be "brand new" and "factory sealed" bull...I got them, and noticed that the artwork on the box (as well as the pamphlet inside, and even the art on the discs) seemed a little...dark and grainy. Like it had been printed off of regular printer paper. I must've been right, because Cinderella won't even play. When I try to play it, it just has some wierd screen that i've never seen before, that to me looks like it was a copied disc that got messed up...I thoroughly believe that every disc this vendor sells (at least the ones I got) are bootleg copies. I do not suggest purchasing from them...spend a little more and buy from an honest vendor.

The complete list of dvds I received from them (and all look shady to me) are:

.Cinderella
.The Lion King
.Aladdin
.Peter Pan

P.S- These movies spanned two separate orders, however, they were only a day or so apart, so I hadn't received the first batch, yet. Otherwise I WOULD NOT HAVE USED THIS SELLER
