I've seen this movie a couple of times and everytime it leaves me with the same reaction....impressed with the acting and shocked from seeing such sadness. Without writing a long paragragh about the storyline which you'll be reading in other reviews I'll just say that this movie covers many subjects. It shows poverty in its most vivid reality. It has abuse, rape, gangs, crime, suicide, hate, disrespect, dysfunctional parenting etc. It also shows love, pride and a respect for tradition and history of their people and ancestors. The problems of the Heke family are vast. You don't have to live in New Zealand to experience them. I live in the U.S.A and poverty and all it's baggage are living here as well. Also, in other countries I am certain. I applaud all the talented actors in this movie. They had my emotions all tangled up. That is how I know that I had just seen brilliant acting. Unlike many abused wives who stay with abusive husbands, I was happy to see that Beth Heke finally walked away. It was sad that her awakening happened to late. It cost her a child. I have seen only one other movie that left me with the same feelings as I felt with this movie and it was a titled "American History X". It is also a must see!
