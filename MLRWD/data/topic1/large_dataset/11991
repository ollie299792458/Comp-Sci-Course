This is Scorsese's finest moment.  A poetic work that mixes the deeply personal story of a boxer with unbelievable directorial style.  The movie's fighting scene's are something to behold.  We get almost a dance sequence  of poetic movements and violence. There is also a religious underplay in  the movie (Scorsese is a devote catholic) which is shown through the final  boxing bout, where DeNiro is 'crucified' on the ropes.  Aside from the  black and white photography and expert use of the camera, the movie's real  focus is not boxing, but masculinity.  LaMotta feels somewhat inadequate  sexuallly and as a man.  He has to constantly prove that he can fight and  be a 'contender.'  He is violent and a bad husband because he is constantly  beating himself up.  He struggles with the notion that his girl finds  another boxer attractive.  His response is mauling him in the boxing ring  so that he is not a 'pretty boy' anymore.  Another conflict exists  between LaMotta and his brother, who is played brilliantly by Joe Pesci. La  Motta suspects and eventually accuses him of sleeping with his wife. By the  end of the movie he is a pathetic performer.  A man who is now paid to  provide cheap laughs.  A man who was never knocked down by one of the  greatest boxers in history.  He is alone and decreped.  Overweight and  driven to a life of sleazery by his own paranoia and narcoticism.  Scorsese  is showing us that it is LaMotta, and not other people, who keeps fighting  himself.  This movie is a touching and brutal look at a fighter.  It is  a hallmark movie in terms of its style and film work, but more improtantly  it shows us the tragic fate of a man not being able to come to terms with  his own worth and manhood.
