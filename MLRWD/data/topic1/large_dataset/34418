Belive me, I am being generous in giving this 2 stars. If it wasn't for CUTE little Maggie I would give it 1 star. In the first place, I don't like the whole concept of the movie. Peter Pan isn't supposed to grow up. That's the whole point! Sure, this movie has some good stuff in it but there's so much bad stuff it's not even worth it. Also it had a lot of bad words and gross insults. Tinkerbell and the Lost Boys (Rufio most of all!) were very irritating. I mean, skateboards and graffiti in Neverland? And another thing: Tootles was very, very creepy. The two best parts in it were when Moira was telling Peter Banning how little time they have with their children, and the other was when Maggie says "Look what Jack drew!" That part is really funny. I know some friends of mine really like this movie, so maybe it's a thing where you either love it or hate it. If you want to watch a Peter Pan movie, don't watch this (especially not with your kids): instead, watch P.J. Hogan's MASTERPIECE Peter Pan from 2003.
