I've been waiting to see Pontypool for sometime and now that I've seen it, I can say it's one to strangest and more unique horror films I've seen in sometime. The film focuses on a shock jock radio host in the small Canadian town of Pontypool. Turns out that his mouth has gotten him kicked off the airwaves and he's getting one last chance in the only town that would take him. While on his way to work he almost hits a woman who's wandering about in the snowstorm. As he checks to see if she's unharmed she mumbles something incoherently and disappears into the blinding snow. Our hero continues onto work just a tad bit confused.

  At work he goes through his usual shockjockery but decides to share his run in with his listeners. "what should I have done?" he asks "call 911?" "keep driving?" Suddenly his show is unraveled by reports from his "eye in the sky" helicopter reporter that the once quiet town of Pontypool is being overrun by a mob. They all seem to chanting in unison and tear into their unsuspecting victims with reckless abandon. The mob is growing, and heading straight for the radio station. As the radio host and friends make preparations and baton down the hatches they slowly discover the strange reason for Pontypool's decent into madness.

  Pontypool is a solid if somewhat unfocused "zombie" film. I say unfocused because I found the reason for the outbreak to be poorly explained and just a bit absurd. The film's best qualities are it's ability to keep you engaged and guessing. Pontypool plays its cards close to the chest and the it truly holds the film together. I enjoyed Pontypool and it was entertaining enough for me to overlook some of its flaws. If you're looking for a unique spin on the zombie genre then Pontypool is essential viewing.
