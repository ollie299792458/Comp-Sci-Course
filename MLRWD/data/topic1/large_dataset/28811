If you like watching Big Fails this is for you.  The documentary left me with a really strong desire to know who the other members of the more successful team were and how they achieved navigating the dangerous  waters of the world and arrived at their destination in one piece.  I was especially intrigued by the team member who decided not to be first and went around the world again.
  Crowhurst obviously overestimated his skill level at the very beginning, in all  appearances wanted to abort the race, unfortunately too late, leaving a wife and family by his own hands.
The emotional toll of the  ups and downs of this race clearly left its mark on one of the Crowhurst Family members-a part i certainly did not find entertaining. I thought Mrs Crowhurst accounts were very interesting. It is  amazing  his trimaran still remains grounded and rotting.  Crowhurst as a man is not so unusual,he is just a man who needed some success- who got in way over his head and way underestimated the power of the publicity machine hungering for a big underdog story.  A+ for  film footage and editing-just not my kind of story.
