the same thing happened to star wars episode 1

every one said it was OK,

but they like the old star wars better.

after episode 2 to 3 every one loved it.

the thing is some people don't like change

I respect that,

Im a big fan of  the tenchi series

it was the best anime on cartoon network,

and reminisce  the old show on DVD,

but I also like to see more.

this new ova is not a made up for USA

like robotech 2 the sentinels

it is a true continue  done by the same

people that did the anime series,

it's about 10 years has past

in the story.

plus voices actors have to get into

there characters and that will take about

 some episodes,just check how deferent

they are in the first episode on tenchi muyo ova

and the later episodes.

and funimaton try to get most of the cast

to make it a part, not an adaption like "batman the animated

series" and "the batman."

I know about ryoko's new voices

but you don't know if she will be back

to do the  rest of the ova.

the thing is tenchi is back

and I as well as others

want to see how the story continues.

if people that give it a bad rap

funimation might not finish the rest of the episodes.

for the Engilsh speakers,

and we will never get to see how it ends.:(

only to wach the old DVD'S and wonder.

I'll find out from manga comic,

but I rather enjoy it on DVD to add to my

tenchi collection.
