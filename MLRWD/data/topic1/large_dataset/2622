Foreign films have always had an intrigue to them that has kept a small, loyal audience begging for more.  Small treasures like "Funny Games" is what holds that loyal audience so strongly.  Absolutely captivating with its innovativeness, "Funny Games" takes you on a disturbing journey that certainly makes you think twice letting a neighbor's congeniality make you invite them in.
Beautifully directed by Michael Haneke, "Funny Games" is the strange tale of a pair of teenage rebels who invite their way into a family's home -- only to torture them relentlessly.  Graphic in its depicition and utterly captivating in its grip, the story unfolds into a shocking tale of violence.
The film's most honorable trick is that of manipulating the audience.  While not showing any direct violence (considering the actual graphicness of it), it makes the audience want to peek around the corner.  "What happened?  What did they do?"  The viewer is, ironically, just as guilty as the murdering party -- a strange twist that Michael Haneke choreographed so well that it is impossible to notice he even did it in the first place.
"Funny Games", as mentioned before, is just one of those small treasures that needs to be experienced by oneself.  No, it is not for everyone -- but no movie is.  It is graphic, disturbing, and utterly enthralling.  A movie most certainly not be missed.
