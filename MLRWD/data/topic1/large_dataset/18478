I try to warn people if they are truly going to waste their money on a film, but I see that this little mess is down to seven bucks or so, and it's well worth a two dollar rental out of silly fun.  I suspect that the high ratings here are the result of appreciation for the violent sexual content of the film, but be honest; it was a low-budget, meaningless, badly-acted pile best watched while drunk.  I gave this film one star based on the dvd cover - it's scary, perfectly composed, and beautifully uses lighting and color.  Remember, I'm talking about the cover there.

The talking werewolf sounded like an idiot and only a high-schooler would find those puns amusing.  David Naughton (who still looks pretty good) and Clint Howard showed up for their paychecks, albeit briefly.  What does that stepfather do in order to afford a two-million dollar home?  And why does he have enough time to wander around?  What is with that 70's haircut?

I suppose the most annoying thing is that the movie starts very briefly in "Equatorial Cameroon" and that caused a nagging feeling that wouldn't go away.  Would you let your lovely sister-in-law marry a murderous lunatic, knowing full well that the lunatic could rip apart her, your precious nephew, and dozens of other victims?  There you are, Charlie (yeah, you loser of a character), out being a tough guy hunting in Africa, and you just accept the killer and your brother's death with aplomb.  I suppose you couldn't do anything about it.  Oh, no, I suppose you couldn't find a use for that high-powered rifle just then.  You are only puttering about in the dark in a dangerous country where no one ever asks questions and you could have easily stopped it all with no problem.  Then again, if that happened, then we would have been deprived of brief titillation and sad humor.
