If some of the reviewers of this show strike you as a little immature, don't let that turn you off from this very good adventure series with substance as well as action.
This show's plot has a certain trait that not all shows possess, even in the generally-superior writing we see in anime.  That trait is character development.
Outlaw Star has been compared to Cowboy Bebop, with Bebop being generally considered better.  But read Charles Solomon's candid review of Bebop on this site, and see the part about character development.  The characters of Bebop, such as Spike, are generally static, whereas there is definitely development of OS's main character, Gene.
So while Bebop has the edge in style, soundtrack, and animation, I have to say that the ending to Outlaw Star is very much more fulfilling.  You finally realize at the end of the last episode that Gene really has changed (how, of course, I will not say).  But it's an inspirational moment, to be sure.  There are very few shows that left me feeling so satisfied.
I also want to point out that the first episode isn't very representative of the series as a whole.  The entire tone lightens up after around ep. 4, which is actually appropriate in retrospect, as it is at that point that Gene begins to leave his gritty, earthbound life for the wonders (and dangers) of outer space.
A reminder, to parents and younger viewers, that this is not the more kid-friendly show aired on Cartoon Network.  The content in Outlaw Star, if airing in theaters, would be rated at least PG-13. But I highly recommend it for older teens and up (younger viewers won't fully appreciate it anyway).
