Honey stars the beautiful Jessica Alba as of course Honey Daniels; a struggling dancer who works at a club as a bartender to dance. She is then caught the attention of Mike; a music video director. So she is brought on the set to the new Jadakiss and she pretty much steals the show. So now, she is famous, but while doing the music videos, she leaves behind a dancing class where she catches the eye of kids who are interested in her class. Some of the kids are not doing so well in life; one of them is a drug dealer for a small drug kingpin but eventually he gets caught up while his friends leave him hanging. Eventually as Honey gets known in the music video world, Mike then makes a move on her which Honey is caught off guard, she then tells him to shove it and leaves him at this party which she canceled plans with her best friend Gina to go to Atlantic City. Now when she gets back to work on the new video, she is fired and replaced. So now, while on her way of buying a new studio, she is then put into a financial crunch, and she decides to do a fund-raising dance show so that she can get the money to buy the dance studio. Then comes Missy Elliot to Mike, she didnt like the dancer he has, until he comes back to her like a poor dog looking for food from his former master. Eventually like all Hollywood endings, it ends on a good note. 
The movie is good, but I felt some of the writing was a little poor, but the performances from Jessica Alba was strong. Not Acamedy Award strong, but this is worth checking out.
