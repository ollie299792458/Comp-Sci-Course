I understand why some people didn't like the movie.  I however LOVED it.  It starts off slow; after the first five or ten minutes I was ready to play a video game or something, but I figured that I paid to rent it and dammit I was going to watch it even if it killed me.  I wasn't disappointed!  The movie keeps you guessing, wondering what's going to happen next up until the very last minute.  Then you realize that what happens next doesn't matter when you're in HELL!  I was glued to the screen after the first death.
I agree that this movie could have been done completely separate from the Hellraiser storyline.  Fans of Pinhead are going to be disappointed since His appearance is rather brief.  He also is identified as the Engineer (one of many names, he implies).  It's been a while since I watched the first movies, but weren't Pinhead and the Engineer identified as two separate characters somewhere along the line?
I would consider this movie one of the best in the series.  It's something new, not just a rehash of the same stuff we've already seen/heard.  And incidentally, the inDUHvidual who whined about it being subtitled 'Inferno' but it was snowing all the time needs to get hirself to a library and read (as in a book) some Dante!
There were a few weaknesses, which keep me from giving it 5 stars.  The first few scenes, though necessary to set it up, dragged.  The voice overs by the main character at the beginning and end weren't top quality; they sounded like he was reading them from a script.  (I mean, I know he *was*, but it shouldn't sound like it.)  Pinhead's appearance was briefer than I liked.
Other than that though, fantastic movie, I hope #6 is as good!
