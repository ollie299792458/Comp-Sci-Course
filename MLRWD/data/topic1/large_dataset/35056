"Ordinary People" strikes a cord deep in family issues that most keep hiding forever
 in their hearts - forgiveness.

 Death in the family is hard enough to deal with, but "Ordinary People"  shows us its possible to
 even forgive someone, like your own mother, for not expressly her love for you like you feel
 it was expressed for an older (or younger) sibling.

 Mary Tyler Moore does a supreme job playing the unforgiving mother, while Timothy Hutton
 won the best supporting actor award for the role of Conrad who is riddled with guilt for
 the death of his older brother and pays a price for it at the hands of his mother.

 Forgiveness is one thing many of us will never be able to experience, because so many of
 us never even forgive ourselves for our shortcomings.  This film is so solid, it was won
 the Best Picture Academy award in 1980 - a year that most experts thought would be
 won by "Raging Bull" - but "Ordinary People" won because this film is about finding solace
 in a world riddled by humanity as being "unfair to life" - and where "Raging Bull" loses is
 where it dwells on the negative results of life and "Ordinary People" wins with compassion,
 forgiveness, and the hunger for inner peace inside our souls we so crave when we stumble
 in our own weaknesses.
