Much more than a story of a champion fallen. This could be the story of so many men (titles not withstanding.) I was incredibly moved by this documentary. I had an eerie feeling from the directors' interviews -- how he revealed his motivations for befriending and peeling back the layers of Mike Tyson. [Just my opinion: More for his greed than for his art.] As for the subject of this film, whatever you walk in thinking about him, he will show you more of both -- good and bad. I feel this film could do a lot for so many of our young men - especially those who are engaging in violence [of any sort] to cope with their feelings; feelings of love and feelings of rage and their juxtaposition. A sum of many parts: this is a story of what child abuse can cause any boy in our society and one man that found a way to endure into his 40's. Activists and the social services address much about what girls and women endure, but this time we witness the possible result of the neglect, the lack of nurturing, the missing identity and the poverty in every manner endured by our boys -- and THAT IF they survive the hell -- will become our men. And, this is a story of redemption (the motives of the director aside.) If the director intended to exploit Mike Tyson, Iron-Mike dodged the jab. For women who have endured abuse by a wounded male or their own wounded father... you may find empathy-if you will. The reality that they abuse because they were abused isn't an excuse for their behavior -- it's an understanding that may bring you hope and healing.
