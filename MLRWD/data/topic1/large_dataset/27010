The new version of Pat Garrett, which has the scene where James Coburn visits his wife, restored to the first act is in no way an improvement over the last version.  The previous version which was derived from a previewed version of the film is vastly superior.  There was a  reason why this scene was cut from the preview version, and that is because it plain didn't work, and killed the first act stone dead at that point.  One has to believe that Roger Spottiswoode knew what he was doing when he prepared the "preview version", he was, after all, one of the editorial team on this film.

Having said this, at least the earlier version of Pat Garret is included.  If you have not seen this film before, watch that one first!

As to Ride the High Country, it would be nice if the telecine operators of this and the previous Laser Disc version of the film  would actually listen to the dialog as well as just looking at the pictures.  There are around five scenes that were shot "day for night" that the telecine transfer has managed to turn back into normal day scenes, which makes them seem kind of ridiculous!  People just don't sit round a camp fire and talk about where they are going to sleep, in broad daylight!

"Legendary Westerns" they are all indeed, but a little more care in preparation would not have gone amiss.
