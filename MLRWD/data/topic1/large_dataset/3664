This is a movie about the student experience under the exchange programs made possible by the EU. As someone who has studied in the U.S., Germany, France and now the UK I know first hand what it means to adapt to different cultures, how important it is to overcome stereotypes when dealing with others and how full of funny or slightly awkward situations life in a multinational environment can be.I can truly say that the movie in parts describes exactly what I experienced throughout my student life.

I was disappointed to read that the film was considered 'predictable' by another viewer. Firstly, i dont necessarily believe this person is right, secondly, the director is attempting to portrait the life of a group of multinational exchange students in a more or less realistic way whilst simultaneously making those people laugh that have never experienced life in such a context. Therefore, of course common stereotypes or misunderstandings have to be dealt with as this is what it is like in reality.

I would recommend Auberge Espagnole as an introduction to anyone who is planning on spending a year abroad (please do so, it is the best experience you will ever have!) but also to those who just want to learn about what it feels like to have one foot in your home country and one foot somewhere else in the world.
