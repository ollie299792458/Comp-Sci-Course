Brosnan has certainly stepped down from his 007 roles - he's very bad in MATADOR, both literally and figuratively.  Despite what other critics have said, I found his performance to be only mediocre.  The character portrayed, Julian Noble, is a sleaze who suddenly, but strangely, develops a conscience after years of killing people for a living.  He meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in a hotel bar, and tries, very stiltedly, to form a friendship.  As an assassin, Noble hasn't really had many of those over the years.

The two part ways, and six months later, Noble appears on Wright's doorstep.  He's disoriented/paranoid, and he tells the Wrights that their home is the closest thing he's got to a real home for himself.  He needs Danny's help to get himself out of a predicament.  Unrealistically, Danny accepts.

This whole movie was shallow, dark, twisted and full of bad acting.  Pierce Brosnan gives up his tough-guy attitude with gusto in this movie, and instead moves on to creepy, desperate, whiney and perverted.  The character of Julian Noble is badly written, combining one part crazy madman with one part of childish neediness with yet another part of self-absorbed jerk.  In my opinion, the character could have used a good dose of Xanax and a healthy rewrite!

Peppered with meaningless, shallow sex scenes, heavy doses of the f-bomb, and illogical-acting characters, MATADOR was a big flop!  Even the name alludes to the strangeness of the film!  There was a short scene with the characters at a bullfight, and, after the obvious correlations are made between the main character and the matador, the comparison is later lost, and never resumed - much like many of the other threads of the slapped-together plot.
