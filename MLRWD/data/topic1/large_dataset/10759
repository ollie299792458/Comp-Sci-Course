This is an enjoyable sequel to Meet the Parents that suffers the same fate as many sequels (especially comedies)- it's just not quite as good as the original.

In the first film we meet the bride-to-be's parents, played by Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner. It's only natural that the sequel introduces us to the parents of the groom (Ben Stiller), played by the perfectly cast Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman.

I'm not a big fan of Streisand's film work, but this is a wonderful "comeback" role for her. She is so good as Mrs. Focker that at times I forgot I was seeing Streisand the star on screen. Hoffman is great as her husband, too.

The movie is worth a look just to see DeNiro, Hoffman, and Streisand on screen together. DeNiro's character is an uptight former (?) CIA agent, while his future in-laws could be described as new age or hippies, depending on your age... certainly the opposite, which is the source of much of the comedy. I'm pretty sure this is the only movie with all 3 of them, and the only one Hoffman and Streisand have done together.

Although this film stands on its own as a story, I still suggest seeing Meet the Parents first for those who have not done so.
