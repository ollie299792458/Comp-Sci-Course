Truly, Madly, Deeply (TMD) is an excellent movie.  I saw this movie last week for the first time.  I had read reviews of the film on other websites and wasn't sure that I would like it.  The film sounded weird to me and  when I went to video stores, it was placed in the COMEDY section!  First  thing I would like to say is that this movie is not a comedy.  There are  aspects of it that are amusing, but if you are looking for "My Best  Friend's Wedding", do not rent this movie.
However, this is a  beautifully affecting film, unlike any other I recall seeing.  The best way  I can describe the emotions the film generates is that TMD is what  "City of Angels" wanted to be.  The love that is between the two  main characters in the movie is so deep and moving, and the loss so  profound that I do not recall having such a reaction to a movie in quite  awhile.  
The acting is superb-from all the actors in the film.  I must  admit I am not an Alan Rickman fan, but he does an excellent job.  My  friends call me hard-hearted because I do not cry in movies, but this one  got to me.  I've heard some compare this movie to "Ghost."  Ghost  is vastly inferior compared to TMD.  I think a better comparison is to  "Wings of Desire"-which is one of my all-time favorite films.  The substance and direction of the two films are different, but they both  concern mortality and the celebration of life.  Definitely watch this  movie!
