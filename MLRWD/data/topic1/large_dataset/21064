First off, I would like to state for the record, because people seem to be having a hard time with this one, that Kill Bill Volume 2 is NOT a sequel.  It is the second half of one absoloutly amazing epic.  One review declared that this movie was nothing but a rip-off of old kung-fu movies and spaghetti westerns.  Hello, half the point of this movie is that it is a tribute to all of Tarantino's old favorites, styles and directors, which is clear if you stay through the credits and read the thank yous.  This review had the gall to say that they thought that Uma Thurman wasn't right for the part... Quentin Tarantino WROTE the part for her.  To demean this film by calling it anything less than genius is a flaw that only the "Steven Segal" fans of this day could commit.
Uma Thurman positively shone as The Bride, and Daryl Hannah was spectacular as Elle Driver (not to mention the beauty of a little poetic justice), and Michael Madsen was as bad-ass as Michael Madsen always is.  And eloquent would be a severe understatement in describing David Carradine's performance as Bill.  The editing, the banter, the raw emotion worked so well that you will find yourself paying to see this movie more that once.  Kill Bill Volume 2 is an absolout masterpiece.
