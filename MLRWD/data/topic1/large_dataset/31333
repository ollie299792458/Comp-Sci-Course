This show is definitely aimed at a younger audience (as most Animes are?), and I would like to say that it's also aimed towards a female audience as well... but it can be enjoyable to both.  As a guy, I say that it's a very enjoyable series.  I gave it a 4/5 star rating because it comes off as a little boring, and there is a ton of content that isn't necessary.  I find some jokes are way too overused, some characters have personalities that you never get used to (One of which is a main character.  It's irritating that I just can't like her), and the show itself has a very slow pace.  It's as if each person can't be bothered with whatever they're doing.

Revolving around friendship, each character aims to help another person with whatever they seem to need help with, provoked or unprovoked.  Friendships blossom, and people learn to break out of whatever shells they had been stuck in that held them back from socializing.

If you don't like stories that are purely about nice people doing nice things and making friends, then this show isn't your cup of tea.  I personally didn't leave the show going "I want more!" and foaming at the mouth (Such as "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KO1JRQ">Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (Anime Legends)</a>" did to me... I loved that show) but I did enjoy it for what it was.
