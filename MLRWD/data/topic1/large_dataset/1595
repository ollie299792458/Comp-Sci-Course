I am nearly 20 weeks pregnant and have been using these workout DVDs since early on in the pregnancy.  I love how Lindsay Brin combines fairly serious weight work with some low-key cardio.  Brin has also written <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452296854">How to Exercise When You're Expecting: For the 9 Months of Pregnancy and the 5 Months It Takes to Get Your Best Body Back</a>, and her plan in that book says that she would alternate the workouts on this DVD with cardio every other day.  So for those who are disappointed that this DVD is not intense enough, Brin intended that it be used IN COMBINATION with walking/running/elliptical/etc.  I found that the first trimester workout was a little too short and easy for my taste, by the second trimester workout was just right.  I also enjoyed the fact that she includes a separate yoga practice tailored to each trimester.  The only other criticism that I have is that the set and image quality of the DVDs are a little old-school, but that didn't bother me.
