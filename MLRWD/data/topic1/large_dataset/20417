I'm like many other reviewers in that I remember watching Ruffian's match race.  The beauty of watching her race and the horror of watching her not only breakdown during a race but also refuse to stop racing are indescribable.  Did the movie capture that emotion?  No.

I found the movie to be too melodramatic and overly sentimental.  As some other reviewers have no doubt mentioned, they didn't get horse racing exactly right, but I am always willing to forgive them that.  What I regret is that they never seemed to manage to capture the spirit of Ruffian - her fire, her drive, her incandescence.  That was the essence of Ruffian and why she was not just another fast horse but a legend, even before her death.

But if you have any fondness for horses or horse racing, you should buy this CD any way for two reasons.  One, it includes a Sports Century Flashback of the match race, including interviews with Whiteley, Vasquez, Janney's son, and exercise riders who were around Ruffian.  The Sports Century show hits all the notes that the movie some how misses.

Second, if the pain of losing Ruffian leaves you in tears, you can ease the pain by watching the video of her races and appreciating just how special she really was.

If you want to read more about her, I strongly recommend Schwarz's excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XUAD1S">Ruffian: Burning From the Start</a>
