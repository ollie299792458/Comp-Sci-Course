I absolutely love this movie! I was glad that the producers decided to go with a respected actor like Mr. Damon, instead of some B-Movie beefcake with great abs and little acting skill. The movie is a pleasurable experience and is done in such a way that it prevents the film from feeling dated. The amnesic assassin is considered cliche, but that does not keep the movie from being entertaining. Ms. Potente has good chemistry with Matt and movie does not turn overly sappy with the love interest element in the story. The movie has one of the most enjoyable car chases in movie history. This too is done with such style that it keeps the viewer from feeling jaded in the "seen this before" sense. If anything, I wanted the movie to have a little more action. My only real complaint is the waste of Julie Stiles in this movie. The very beautiful and talented actress is in perhaps 3 scenese. She plays an espionage tech operator in the search for Jason Bourne. I rate this one of the classiest and excellent spy noir films of all time.
