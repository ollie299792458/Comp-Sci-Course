Like many of the other reviewers, I have loved The Flight of Dragons since childhood when I saw it on TV. I taped it at some point in my youth, then something became of the tape--it likely got taped over by accident. When I was in college, I stumbled across a copy of the tape in a store and nearly cried as I snatched it up. I still have the tape, and now my three-year-old daughter is completely enamoured with the movie. All I ask is that it show up on DVD, and fast...before my tape wears out!

Too many fantasy movies and TV shows today are skewed either to sappy-sweet childish themes that leave adults wanting to, at the very least, roll their eyes, or, at worst, gag; on the other hand, many other fantasy movies/shows have such dark, violent or sexual images and themes that I don't feel comfortable exposing my three-year-old to them. The Flight of Dragons, however, is a wonderful movie, a suitable companion to The Last Unicorn, and excellent for all ages. My daughter, husband, and I watch it together with the same enjoyment level, though I'm sure our types of enjoyment vary. My favorite parts of this movie are the excellent scripting (some parts still bring tears to my eyes) and the beautiful, haunting theme song, the words of which I never forgot, even in that long dry spell between losing my homemade tape and finding the "real" VHS in the late 90s. I highly recommend this movie to anyone with or without small children, though the value of this movie as an incredible family fantasy cannot be overrated.
