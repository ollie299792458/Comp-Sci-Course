Out of fairness, I've watched and read several 'left-leaning' views.  Although some may tell their side of the story with eloquence (and some, not so eloquent), I am still left with the same opinion.  Contrary to a seemingly popular belief among liberals, we were attacked by those whom, for the most part, we never would've imagined.  They lived among us, shared our pleasures and freedoms, and yet, despite all that our great country offers, these terrorists insisted on choosing the path of extremism, using our own planes as guided missiles and killing thousands of innocent people.  I have listened to the complaints of how our government (left and right, by the way) have harshly chipped away our freedoms solely for the sake of discriminating against one culture or one race.  For all your griping, however, I've yet to hear a clearer or more approachable alternative to tracking down a terrorist.  Other than grossly alterating our lifestyles, which by the way, will never be a viable choice among the majority, what do you suggest we do in the name of security?
