Every time I read a negative review of the original Lonesome Dove (although there are VERY few bad ones) it makes me want to reach through the computer screen, grab the reviewer by the shirt and say "what the #@%$!! are you talking about?!?!?!"

As long as we're talking about the original 360+ minute miniseries, starring Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, then we are talking about one of the greatest stories every put to film.  The story, the characters, the acting are all top notch.  The production values, even from a 1989 TV event, are all on par with most theatrical movies, except for a few very minor "special effects" sequences which show some signs of age and budget constraints.

In my life, I have never seen a better, more human, more realistic, more emotionally connected story than Lonesome Dove.  Most Westerns, while they may have their dramatic merits, are unfortunately poor portrayals of the American West as it was in the 1800's.  They are almost always overly romanticized, melodramatic stories which have little resemblance to what it must have actually been like.

Lonesome outshines them all, finally presenting the Old West as it probably truly was.  A wild country filled with REAL people, living hard lives with real relationships, adventures, emotions and heartbreak.  In fact, Lonesome Dove outshines most all movies and series in general, not just westerns.

And don't get me wrong, while it certainly has its share of death, sadness and hardship, Lonesome Dove is a wonderful viewing experience, full of life, humor and adventure.

Lonesome Dove is my favorite movie.  Please give it a chance.
