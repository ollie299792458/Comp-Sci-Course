This is quite simply one of the best suspense films I have ever seen.

Hithcock is obiviously the master at this, but I think this film is near perfect, bringing everything that Hitchcock is great at together in a tight, tense atmosphere.

Personally, I believe Cary Grant was never as captivating then when he revealed that dark, insecure yet sauve side of himself in Hitchcock films (Suspicion is another great example of this). Grant's performance of Devlin is wonderful. Devlin refuses to let himself fall in love with a woman who he must convince himself is a partier, a drinker, and definately not a lady. In forcing himself to believe this, he manages to push Alicia further and further into danger.

Ingrid Bergman is nothing short of stunning as Alicia, definately a perfect performance. Alicia sense of guilt over her father's war crimes and her guilt over being the daughter of such a man, lead her first to drink and then, through Devlin, to become an American agent. Throughout the film she tries to redeem herself in her own eyes, that of the country she loves, and in the eyes of Devlin. She sacrifices herself, stepping right into a deadly affair with Sebastian, all the time hoping Devlin will admit his true feelings.

Claude Rains is excellent as Sebastian; who is so consumed by his feelings for Alicia, that he ignores the dangers of the men he is working with and the dire and jealous warnings of his mother.

The dialog in this film is beyond compare. It is sparse, dark and biting, like the film itself to thicken the cloud of suspense wrapping around the characters and the audience. Hitchock takes Grant's unique inflection and beat that helps him to literally be a "smooth, fast, charmer" and gives his words a darker tone. It sends shivers down the spine to hear Devlin speak.

This film is stunning. Hitchcock's best and one of my all-time favorites!
