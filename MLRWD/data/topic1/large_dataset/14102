Although it has been decades since I first saw "Fiend Without A Face",some of the film`s grotesque imagry still remains with me. This film is your typical "B" movie(sci-fi/horror genre) of the 50`s/60`s...complete with stilted dialog and generic characters.Actually a fairly well-made "B" movie that puts a nice twist on the tired "man-made or mutated nuclear moster" theme. "Fiend" has an interesting story and some very graphic effects,that can still hold their own. NOTE:See the other reviews for the plot/story outline,please. :) The stop motion photography of the animated brain/spinal cord creatures ambulating like inch worms and leaping onto the necks and heads of their victims is way over the top! The use of a hideous slurpping/sucking sound effect for the feeding Fiends is downright nasty! Adding to the surrealism of the Brain & Spine munching Fiends(they`re little more than mobile human brains themselves),are the TERRIBLE screams and moans of sheer agony that come from the victims while they are fed upon.  One scene,especially,is haunting.One fellow trys to outrun the things and is overrun  by 4-6 hungry brains,all of them greedily jostling for position on his head,neck,and shoulders. Quite vivid.In summary: Not the best "B" film made,but certainly one of the most unusual and most haunting. I`d like to see John Carpenter or maybe David Cronenberg remake this film sometime. Anyone else and it would become another cheesy moster gore-fest. Thanks for reading my review.
