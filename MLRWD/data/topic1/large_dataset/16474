This is a war movie.  It reminded me, in ways of some of the war movies of Vietnam, such as Casualties of War, except that it was far less violent.  Rapes are hinted at, but not graphically shown.  I was pleased not to be overwhelmed with bad language, as some films do.  People are brutally killed, but not every graphic detail is shown.  I thought it was appropriate in what it showed.  A good war movie, but not out to super-shock the audience.  This movie tries instead to entertain, and succeeds well.  Both my husband and I really enjoyed the acting by Bruce Willis.  The movie has plenty of action, but doesn't overdo it, concentrating on the drama of trying to rescue doctors and missionaries from a clinic.  Instead, the main doctor won't leave without all her patients coming along.  Bruce Willis tricks her by telling her they will take the patients, only to grab her, and leave the patients behind.  He then changes his mind, against his commander's will, and he and his team are then on their own to try to walk everyone through the jungle to safety, showing all of their numerous difficulties along the way.
