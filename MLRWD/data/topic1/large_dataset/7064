My personal all-time favorite and widely considered to be one of the best film noirs ever made, I envy anyone who has yet to see this film. Complete with story and plot, mood and atmosphere, twists and turns, this film picks up the audience, completely surrounding it so that nothing else matters, and takes control of the collective mind from beginning to end. 
Laura's beauty and character touched everyone who knew her. The acerbic columnist, in love with her and willing to do anything to keep her; the good-for-nothing heir, keeping up the pretense of living of another's fortune; the aunt who hated her for her beauty and wished her dead; the maid who worshiped her for her kindness; the hard-boiled detective in love with the portrait of a dead woman.
And then there is Laura herself. Beautifully played by Gene Tierney at the height of her career, we are at once drawn to her and once we have seen her, nothing else matters. The shy advertising artist, the blossoming career woman, and finally, the self-assured beauty that is worshipped by those around her--and we are there to witness the transformation. But it is not really a transformation; we are just beginning to really understand her.
In film noir, the opening scene is critical and often plays with the mind of the audience, where nothing is as it seems. And this film is a classic example. It opens up with a haunting scene in the outer foyer of Waldo Lydecker's home with his voice-over "I shall never forget the weekend that Laura died..." Beautifully acted, scripted, and directed, this is a must see for classic and noir fans alike. Get set. You are in for a real treat.
