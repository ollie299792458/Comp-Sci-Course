There are lots of films that explore the medium of film (De Palma's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JPJHL0">Blow Out</a> and Fellini's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U6DVQM">8 1/2</a> particularly come to mind), but none do it in quite the same way that Michael Powell's classic Peeping Tom does.

Peeping Tom is a roller coaster ride all the way through. Unlike many of the thrillers (especially the British ones, like this) from its time period, this film moves incredibly quickly. Though it's only 101 min long, there's a ton of material packed in. It's a showcase for all sorts of different emotions from fear to desperation, temptation, and even joy. You feel all sorts of different feelings and really get into the mind of a killer. As it turns out, this is a frightening place to be.

Though Hitchcock's classic Psycho (also a must-see) is credited with revolutionizing horror cinema, I believe this, which came out just months before Psycho, also deserves much of that credit. Together, these two films pioneered the audience incrimination techniques, as well as the archetypal "charming, quiet, young man" as serial killer that has since become a staple of the genre. You must see this film, and if you do, this is the edition to see.

Though I desperately want a Blu-Ray transfer of this film, the DVD will have to do for now. As always (or at least since about Spine No. 50 of the first editions), The Criterion Collection and Janus Films have supervised their own brilliant restoration and transfer of the film. It preserves the original (and slightly exotic) aspect ratio of 1.66:1 and looks marvelous. Of course, as always with the Criterion Collection, the special features are top notch as well, although there could be more. This is just about perfect.

Pros:
  + A great film by a great director.
  + Transfer faithfully preserves original aspect ratio and colors.
  + Awesome special features.

Cons:
  - Pricey, especially for a last-generation copy (the packaging template has changed since this was released).
  - By the Criterion Collection's standards, there are very few special features here.
  - It's not available on Blu-Ray, nor are there any immediate plans to create a Blu-Ray version. (I guess this isn't a con so much as a reason to buy the DVD).

Overall: JUST BUY IT!
