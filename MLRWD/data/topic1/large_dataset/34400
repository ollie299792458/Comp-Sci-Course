Like Water for Chocolate.... the only connection is the fluidity of the element... even that is a lie.... chocolate is oily, rich and thick... Water is none of these things... In life, if you try to substitute water where the situation requires chocolate, well... in a recipe the same goes.  The cake will fall flat... the lovers will run away.... Life will be unhappy.

Recipes are passed from generation to generation, from mother to daughter most often, or perhaps from aunt to niece, whichever, food and love go together as inherited traits in our character.

This movie generates many emotions and should be watched with friends and lots of popcorn!

Purchased as a gift for a friend who confessed she has not really taken time to watch movies over the last 20 years but wanted to begin.  I felt that she should watch at least one foreign language film to begin her film appreciation stage.  It takes some time to get accustomed to reading sub-titles, but there is something alluring about hearing another language.  I suppose this version may have had English dubbed over, but since it was a gift I did not open the package. It camed sealed same as if purchased in store.  It is a Christmas gift for 2008 and so we'll see what she thinks after the new year.
