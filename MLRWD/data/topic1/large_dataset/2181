What makes this film stand out is its humanity.  The most successful independent films are those that have well-rounded characters, and this is a stellar example.  Read some of the reviews here:  the authors have read so many different insights into these characters that you'd think they were talking about real people!

I liked this film when I first saw it, but when I caught the end of it on cable last night it brought me to tears, and here's why:  it's one of the very few movies I've ever seen that really comes to terms with our mortality.  A lot of people get killed in movies, but few confront death the way living, breathing people have to.  I'm not just talking about death, whose imminence hovers over Joy and the whole family through the movie; I mean the the experience or possibility of failure in the face of one's most sincere and heroic efforts, which is April's life story.  Every movie out of Hollywood tells you that you can make it if you just try.  This movie holds you in suspense with the possibility that failure may be unavoidable.

Maybe it resonated for me because, as a spouse of a disabled person, I've had more contact with our human limits than most people my age.  But I think anybody who has tried as hard as they can to reach for something or somebody and still come up short will recognize the pain of real life in these flawed, very human people.
