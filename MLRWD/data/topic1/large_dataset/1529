After the lackluster and somewhat disappointing blu-ray for "Destroy All Monsters" and the defective dvd of it, I was beginning to lose faith in Tokyo Shock/Media Blasters. Other companies like Magnet/Magnolia and Well Go USA are putting out some stellar transfers for foreign film gems. But Tokyo Shock/Media Blasters has stepped up with their legitimate dvd release for "Godzilla vs. Megalon". I watched the film on a upconverting dvd player in 1080p with surround sound on a 55" 1080p LCD hdtv. I must say that I am very impressed with this transfer. The quality of the a/v presentation is some of the best I've seen in the dvd format for kaiju and tokusatsu stuff. As far as "Godzilla vs. Megalon" being the worst film in the franchise, I can't really say that; although Gojira riding on his tail and drop-kicking was a little ridiculous. After watching the original Japanese language version of the film, I have much more appreciation for the film. With the dvd looking this good, I can only imagine how the eventually released blu-ray version will look.
