Since purchasing this set, I have watched it through twice and some parts three or more times.  It is both entertaining and gives a good overview of Beatles music.  The real strength of this set is the range of music it includes and the very fine video from televised performances, newsconferences, reporting, documentaries, etc.  The film clips are very good.  I also liked the special features extremely well, particularly the feeling of the remaining Beatles (three at that time) about arranging and recording John's "Free As A Bird" and "Real Love" tapes.

The film gives only a very general chronology.  It also addresses some controversies in passing, but the main focus is on the music and the sensation that resulted from it as well as recording the individual personalities of The Beatles.  Ringo probably talks more and is more open in the interviews on this series than I have ever seen him.

I found that the series fed my desire to explore specific topics of Beatles history including the Hamburg experience, Stu Sutcliffe, Pete Best, Brian Epstein, George Martin and Goeff Emerick at EMI studios; Cynthia Lennon and Yoko Ono.  So, it's not the whole story, but the central portion of it--the boys themselves and as musicians.  And I take it as a very strong complement to these materials that I was encouraged to look deeper.
