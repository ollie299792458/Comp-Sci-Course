This was the most accurate portrayal of hacking I have ever seen. The speed at which they are able to connect via analog modem was also very accurate. I thought that the personal, proprietary browser and instant messaging technology added a very interesting aspect to the film. If it wasn't for this movie, I would never have seen those kickflippin' graphics with the jail bars that load so quickly when you try talk to a corporate computer. The soundtrack also very accurate, as well as the references to the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture, were a real testament to the research the film company had to have done. By far, the most impressive and accurate character in this film is Mr. The Plague -- as a security expert myself, I felt the portrayal of his work environment could have itself been a picture of my very own work! (Except my work environment sadly does not feature Penn of Penn & Teller, nor is my skateboard quite as retro, but still)

The fact that prompts are plain text now but in 1995 they were huge, wavy, green letters just goes to show the degree to which Microsoft has slowed progress in the computer market.

I think this film wholly does inspire us to 'hack the planet'.
