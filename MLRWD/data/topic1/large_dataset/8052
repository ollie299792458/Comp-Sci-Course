I think some reviewers missed that this film is a playful and satirical take on 50's high fashion, American tourists, Parisian clich&eacute;s, folk singers, beatniks and (pseudo)intellectuals. There are a lot of clues early on but the biggest one is when Kay Thompson's character is told everyone is wearing pink (as she has instructed) - why isn't she? Her reply: "I wouldn't be caught dead!" And then there's Dovima as Marion, playing up her Queens accent against her exotic model persona - she is funny and perfect! Every time I watch this film, I catch something I previously missed: the twelve little girls in two straight lines at the church, how the final scene becomes nothing less than an impressionist painting, Richard Avedon's hand and eye throughout (the opening titles turn out to be the Quality Magazine covers on the walls.)  Quirky things about Kay Thompson's jewelry and shoes throughout. The clothes! The music! It is so correct in its details and yet so over the top as a whole - fun!

I agree that Astaire was nearly too old for the part but he's Fred Astaire - who cares?  Audrey Hepburn was one of the last great Hollywood glamour-pusses and was paired with a number of aging stars, for instance Bogart in Sabrina and Cary Grant in Charade. Rex Harrison? Gary Cooper? Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday was a pretty close match, but she seldom had an age appropriate leading man. Maybe part of the problem is that she was just so lovely, she never really seemed to age at all.

Bottom line: this is a film to lift the spirits.
