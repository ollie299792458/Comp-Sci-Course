This film had high expectations given the cast Gosling, Dunst, and Langella, but the story, some of the editing, and the utter lack of explaining or atleast a fictional theory of an explanation of what the director or the writer thought that happened at some key plot points were almost non existant. Maybe they wanted to leave a lot to the imagination, but the last 30-40 minutes of the film could have been cut down quite a bit.

People just seem to pop in and out and some of them don't even have names.  Like I stated before the acting was great, but as far as character development, which is what a film like this needs was non-existant. You need to care what happens to the characters in order to want to watch the movie.

In my opinion the director knew this and just put a random nonsense nude shower scene of gosling and dunst just to make someone waste a few bucks to see some cheap thrills.  This is the only reason to even instant watch this movie if netflix even desides to aquire it.
