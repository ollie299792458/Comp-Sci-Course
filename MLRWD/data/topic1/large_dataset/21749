Bursting with action, "Zulu" can easily be considered a fine war film.  Personally, I feel it is one of the best of its kind.

  Set against beautiful Africa vistas, "Zulu" guides the audience through a small British garrison that's in the process of being beseiged by thousands of bloodthirsty Zulu warriors.  However, the Brits don't budge an inch, for they are well-disciplined.  The Zulus respond with constant attacks(in the form of wonderfully-filmed action sequences), hoping to break the spirit of their enemy.  What follows is an exciting look into events with historical significance.

  This was, I believe, Michael Caine's first film, and he does well as Lieutenant Bromhead.  Stanley Baker, who produced and acted, is equally good as his superior officer.

  The DVD version of this film does not represent "Zulu" with any bonus features, save the theatrical trailer.  On the other hand, the picture is good and the sound is fine.  Certainly better than the VHS version.
