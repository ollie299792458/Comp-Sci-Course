I can guarantee that this will be one of the most powerful, riveting, important films you've ever seen or ever will see. I know people who have told me their lives were literally changed by it. DO NOT be put off by what you may think is the gruesomeness of the subject matter; yes, this compelling tale is horrifying (though not as horrifying as the reality of stoning), but is also surprisingly uplifting and even laced with moments of beauty. I promise that you will not regret owning this film.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the direction by screenwriter/director Cyrus Nowrasteh is outstanding and the acting is Oscar-worthy throughout - and not just by Shohreh Aghdashloo (who plays Soraya's aunt) or Mozhan Marno (Soraya).  Navid Negahban is one of the all-time best cinematic bad guys as Soraya's ruthless husband.

This is based on a true story that took place in the decade or so after the Khomeini revolution in Iran in 1979, but astonishing as it may be to believe, stonings still take place there despite an ostensible 2002 "moratorium" - just as they continue to take place in other places where sharia law rules: Nigeria, Somalia, Indonesia, etc.  So this movie is more timely and necessary than ever. Don't miss it.
