This was an interesting flick that tells the tale of growing up in a catholic school.  It uses an interesting method of storytelling, as it interweaves cartooning and live action drama to tell the story of two boys growing up, causing mischief, and just being boys.  
The animation is done by McFarlane Studios, who, if you don't know, produces/produced the cartoon series Spawn.  Personally, I didn't really appreciate the animation scenes as much as I could have because I almost felt they took away from the drama of the movie, but the QUALITY of the animation was still top notch.  
The story was interesting, at the very least, humorous at times, tense at times, and even sad at times.  It's a good film to watch, but I don't know if I'd recommend it to everyone to buy.  The acting is great in this one, with standout performances by Jodie Foster and Vincent D'Onoforio (sp). 
As I said, I don't think I'd recommend this film to EVERYONE to buy, but I enjoyed it and it was well worth the $8 I paid for it, though I wouldn't give it "rave" reviews either.
