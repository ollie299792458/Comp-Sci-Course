Many people do not realize that Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" was mostly written by Arthur C. Clarke. The collaboration actually was more dependent upon Clarke than Kubrick. The sequel was also based on the written work of Clarke, and the film, to be a worthy sequel, did not necessarily require Kubrick's touch (as special as that touch is). The first film (and the first book) were meant to stand alone -- there was no plan for a sequel. Therefore, the original works could not readily be expected to furnish the expository material that a sequel could ably do. Thus the sequel seems less vague and more "conventional" than the original. But this does not imply inferior! Upon the conclusion of "2010" I was in a state of rapture -- the film truly was a DIRECT descendant of the original! Clarke wrote the sequel within the same philosphical context with which he had written the first work.
 The production of "2010" is on a fairly grand scale and does not in the least disappoint as a sequel to its Great Predecessor. The two films could be conjoined and shown as one (long) film -- as far as I am concerned.
 Peter Hyams must have had some reservations about following Kubrick in this project, but his success is complete! The direction, acting, effects and filming are all superb. We truly owe him a debt of gratitude!
