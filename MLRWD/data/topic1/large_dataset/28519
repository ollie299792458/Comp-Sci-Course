I did like the movie. I loved the amazing make-up works on the actors who played the apes. VERY REALISTIC! :) But come on, did they HAVE to do the ape sounds??? I grew up with the original Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston and I fell in love with the whole series because it had a Twilight Zone/Outer Limits feel to it. I loved the feeling of being surprised and weirded out at the very end of the first movie of the original movies. Charlton Heston finding out that he was on the planet earth the whole time. FREAKY! :)

But the renewed version and how the actors acted like....well....apes, was a bit much. Another thing, they left a movie with a possible sequel. Something of which Tim Burton rarely does. But at the same time, the movie wouldn't have the right feel to it if someone else directed the movie. Look at the Batman movies. The first two were great, then they went downhill from there. Tim Burton directed them and the second movie, people practically begged him to do it. What I'm trying to say is, you can't direct a blockbuster and expect someone else to pick up the tab. So a sequel to Planet of the Apes is pretty much nil.
