Honestly, "hackers" does not capture the true cultural aspects of the technological underground. nor does it contain many accurate technical references. however, it did, in my oipinon capture the idealistic  view that many people of my age group (16) share. what fun one could have  beeing free of all technological restrictions and limitations. If you dont  have much of an interest in computers or technology i wouldnt recomend this  review. while it tries to appeal to a brauder audience by leaving many  technical elements out, i feal that it only truley captures computer  oriented watchers. as for myself, comming from that sort of backround, i  love this movie. i too have the DVD, and have watched it so many times i  know every line (seriously). this movie is too many computer kids, what a  movie about michael jordan and his close group would be to kids striving  for excelence in basketball. "hackers" is an energetic look at  teenage life in a big city, where children living in a society more and  more controled by computers are searching for a medium through which they  can excersize their own authority... give it a chance?
