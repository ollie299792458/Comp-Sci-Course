"The Robe" is a great film showing how Christ truly can change an individual--and Rhichard Burton's character goes through a remarkable change, almost Paul-like. The special features on the Blu-ray Disc are sweet! (especially the times 2, as the film was shot simulatneously as widescreen and full screen)
