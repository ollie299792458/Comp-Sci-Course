I've seen this movie every year since I was in grade school. Unfortunately, with all the politics on what can be broadcast on tv, this movie has been "shelved" for several years now.  My son is now in the 3rd grade and is asking a lot of questions about what does Easter truly mean.  The first answer that came to me, was the movie, Jesus of Nazareth.  I ordered the DVD right away.  Within a couple of days, we had the movie and we both watched it in complete awe.  This movie is so beautiful, touching and extremely spot on to the Bible.  I would HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone who is curious about the life of Jesus Christ.  Jesus of Nazareth is beautifully made and answered so many questions that my son had.  We even went back to the Bible after the movie to verify the relativity of some occurances and gladly found that the movie depicted what the Bible stated.
Now when we go to Mass and hear the readings, my son understands and wants to learn more. This movie will always be my favorite!  It is a "must have" for all Christians who want to know and see our Lord!  It is amazing!!
