I enjoyed this movie very much, but then I'm a sucker for dance movies. Channing Tatum, the male lead has once again changed his spots.  He's been a basketball player(Coash Carter), a soccer player(She's The Man), an angry/abused tough kid(A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints and now a streetkid/dancer in this movie.  These are just a few of his roles and I think that he pulls this one off very well.  The two leads, Ty and Nora come from two different worlds, but are brought together because of their love of dance and each other.  You get to see a lot of dance, hear a lot of music ( I reccomend the soundtrack) and of course a happy ending.  And "widescreen a must" because when you see it on tv, and then you see the dvd on widescreen, you realize just how much you really do miss.  On widescreen you get to see so much more of the final dance number.  So if you are in to music, dance or love stories, I highly reccomend this movie, but watch it on widescreen if you can...but ignore Nora's friend Lucy, she is so fake!
