I am aware that the DVD is not yet available.  This is a review of the Concert that it was taped at.
The AOL Concert for Schools on the Great Lawn of Central Park was nothing short of spectacular.  They started the show with "Don't drink the Water" and over the next 2hours and 45 minutes played hit after hit including: Crush, Warehouse, All Along the Watchtower, Dancing Nacies, Tripping Billies and so many others.  The set design was fantastic and their production team deserves a great deal of credit for the work they do.  They do a tremendous job of using the lighting on and around the stage to enhance the music, and it works very well.
The best part about the concert was ofcourse the band.  I have been to concerts given by U2, Bruce Sprintsteen and Coldplay and I can safely say that the Dave Matthews Band have a well deserved reputation as the best live band in the world.  Their performance was so *tight*  It's really clear that they love the material, and love performing it even more.  They had 70,000+ people, (who had all been standing, crammed together on the lawn, for several hours) wanting more after the concert was over.  It was really just a tremendous show.  I would recommend it to not only a casual Dave Fan, but to anyone who loves great performances of good music.
