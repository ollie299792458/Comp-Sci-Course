This is one of the finest black comedies to come out in years.  Director Danny DeVito plunges into a dark and corrupt world of children's television in New York City.  Robin Williams gives an intense performance as a popular performer for children who loses his throne in disgrace, and is supplanted by an arrogant hippie who tries to clean up the way business is done.  
The caper soon involves multiple plots against the life of  "Smoochy," the mealticket with a conscience.  Involved in the intrigues and counter-intrigues are cynical network executives, the Irish mafia, a villainous charity organization, and a disgraced performer who is now homeless and deranged with anger.  Meanwhile, the granola-brained Smoochy (played by Edward Norton) conceives of a narcissistic and horrendous ice show that completely sends up our culture of spectacle and self-involved commercial "art."
It is a wicked, no-holds-barred, brackish comedy with laser-precise comic timing and a dark, dark satire on American culture.  I missed lines because I was laughing so hard.  Highly recommended.
