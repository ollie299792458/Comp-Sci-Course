This is one cheesy sci-fi movie that is uncanny interesting and entertaining.  My mind went numb and became observant when I watched such unorthodox screenwriting.  Many other reviewers are comparing the "Returner" to the like of Americans' movies of the "Matrix" or "Terminator" which is somewhat only proportional true.  Maybe the plot wasn't too original, time-traveling to save the past, but the style and flow fair more favorable to an Anime style.  Japanese's' acting and culture is somewhat profoundly different from Western's culture.

The acting in this movie even with the goofy storyline and characters' role was actually good and believable.  You got the prototypical Japanese female star character, Anne in this case, that is reservedly spoken, seamlessly helplessly defenseless, but featuring some unique superpower. She possesses a time forcing mechanism.  The typical male character, Takeshi, is a gung ho cowboy-like loner with mad combat skill.  The Villains providing most of the cheesy factor were comically evil.

The industrial and science lab scenes were fairly detail and enticing.  The CG was pretty cool with a mechanical dragon alien that look like Sky Lynx.  Even though the movie has a tint to it; the film quality was not great, a little grainy.

Without analyzing too much and overlooking cultural acting style, the "Returner" is an entertaining movie for the open-minded.  I would not mine buying this movie when the price drops some, because it was interestingly different.
