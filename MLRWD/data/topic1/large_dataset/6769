I have been looking forward to this DVD for a very long time. I received it yesterday and all my expectations have been exceeded. Where do I start? The video quality is superb; in fact probably the best live performance ever captured on a DVD. I am lost for words,  the audio quality is also impressive to say the least. The actual performance by Whitesnake was flawless, Coverdale's voice was better than ever. Doug Aldrich's guitar performance was awesome, he is in my opinion one of the most underrated guitar players in the world. In point of fact, he does a much better job than Vai did while playing guitar for Whitesnake. Doug is an extraordinarily competent guitar player. The crowd was truly enthusiastic and excited.

The song selection was good as well. The band played all my favorites: Is this Love, Fool for your Loving, Here I go again, Love Ain't no Stranger and Still of the Night. I have nothing else to add besides the obvious that this is a must have even for those who are not ardent fans of Whitesnake. All music lovers should add this DVD to their collection. It is a masterpiece.

BUY!
