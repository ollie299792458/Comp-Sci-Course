I'll start off by saying that not all of this movie was good,  sometimes the murders were over exadurated (like the hot tub scene) and Michaels knife did not look half as powerful as the filmakers made it. However, there were many good qualities of the film.

1: John Carpenter made it so it would start at the last three minutes of HALLOWEEN I and after that it would go to Michael Myers perspective and finally end up in the hospital.

2: No movie had picked up where the last one left off since the mid thirties.

3: Michael does not accomplish what he intended to, but Laurie does... mostly and so does Dr. Loomis.

4: Makes it so Michael seems dead in the end when he's really not and neither is Dr. Loomis.

5: Made you have no clue who was going to die even through the end.

6: Great acting.

7: Michael looks freekier than ever.

8: This is much better than 3,4,5,6 and 8.

9: Scared the hell out of me.

If you love halloween than you should have already seen this, if not than see it anyway, it's one hell of a movie.
