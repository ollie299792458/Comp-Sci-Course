I'd heard about this film a few years ago, so I picked it up and watched it with my two boys.
It was interesting to see WWII from the German side of things, especially their view of the Russian Front, an idiom all-too-often imagined by us Americans, rather than seen or experienced.
*Stalingrad* follows a German lieutenant and his squad from their R&R in Italy to their ultimate deployment in the longest, largest and most costly battle of the war.  The other recent film about this battle, *Enemy at the Gate* is a slicker production with a bigger budget and recognizable stars.  But it catches only brief glimpses of the situation's intractable desperation.  *Stalingrad* packs more emotion and spirit, its protagonists more real, more flesh and blood than *EATG*.  There is no romantic subplot to distract from the Germans' struggle against their two inevitable foes---the Russian soldier and the Russian winter.
As they change from an elite and well-equipped Storm Trooper unit to becoming a rag-tag band of starving deserters, they  search for a safe haven in a world where everything else is the enemy.  
The squad unsuccessfully grapples with contradiction while Humanity takes a backseat to the German War Machine.  One message is made clear:  the German soldiers possess far more compassion than the Nazis. 
*Stalingrad* has lots of blood and guts a la *Saving Private Ryan*. Although Stalingrad's battle-gore FX are far less realistic than those employed by SPR, it's not for the squeamish viewer. 
My sons and I were emotionally affected by this film.  We saw how War is not always fought on bright summer days and is not as glorious a pursuit as we may have imagined.  But most of all we learned that our enemies aren't all Nazis or zealots or villains.  The poor fellows freezing in the trenches are human beings just like us.
