This is a film about angels in Berlin before the wall came down. These are angels that Rilke would have understood.  Not sentimental like It's a Wonderful Life, and infinitely more intense than it's wannabe remake as  City of Angels.
Peter Falk plays himself in a way in, well, you have to  see the movie to understand, but it is one of his best roles, and I don't  want to give away any of the incredibly rich plot. 
Part of it's charm  and intensity are in the conversations between the angels and also how they  try to help us on the plane of thoughts and emotions. These angels go  everywhere, even to the circus, where some small children even see them and  they nod to each other. Oh, yes, and who can ever forget the scene in the  library where the angels hover above readers of all ages, listening to  their thoughts, wishing for them, it seems....
And listening the the  thoughts of the young streetwalker, the man about to commit suicide,  anohter whose mother has just died, an old poet in the industrial  wasteland, observing a certain shift of light in the afternoon....
In the  midst of these conditions, one angel played by Bruno Gans, falls in love  and decides to become human, to become mortal, to become vulnerable in all  senses. 
This and its sequel are two of the great ones of the last twenty  five years, maybe in in movie history....
