This was great, but I think it could've been twice as long and still have been fascinating.

The most affecting part, I thought, of the whole documentary was when Keith and Anita start to talk about his developing (worsening?) heroin addiction during that time. This should have been explored more--Keith's comment about how he was 'tired of having to be somebody else all the time' made me genuinely sad. But the topic is quickly dropped, and everything seems fun again, which is too bad--could've been really interesting to learn more about this, and on his habit's effect on the band, etc etc.

In general, I thought that Anita's perspective should have been more highly developed--that could have been possible in a longer film.

And the seemingly random testimonials at the beginning and end of the film should've been totally cut. With the exception of Don Was, Martin Scorsese and maybe Jack White, those people should not have been included. Why should we care what Benicio Del Toro, Sheryl Crow, and the dreadful will.i.am think about 'Exile'? I definitely don't care. Thankfully, their comments are brief.

But these are nitpicky points--overall, it's really great, I thought!
