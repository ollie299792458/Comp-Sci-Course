I had to write a review of this DVD right away as I was so disappointed.  I love Kylie Minogue.  She has that air-brushed look of beauty and perfection about her; and while she can sing, this DVD is absolutely horrid.
Pros:
Kylie Minogue is beautiful and very sexy.  If you only want beauty and sexiness this DVD has it.  There are many costume changes throughout the concert.
Cons:
You can hardly hear a word that she is singing.  The background noise and orchestration is way too loud, drowning Kylie's voice out.  Unless you know the words to the songs, you will hardly be able to understand anything that she is singing.
The dancers are awful.  The dancers' costumes are awful.  I do not know about you, but I do not find men dancing around in stockings and skirts in any way sexy.  The women are wearing these awful body suits with black circles covering their breasts and a black brief built into the suit.  As bad as this is, they are wearing white wigs and horrid makeup.  In short, they look like clowns.  It seems as if Kylie goes out of her way to make everyone else look awful except for her.
While I believe Kylie obviously has dancing ability, she apparently can't sing and dance at the same time.  She hardly moves throughout the concert other then to gyrate her hips or to move her arms like a stupid robot.
There's nothing special about this concert at all.  I was very, very disappointed.  I love Kylie's music, but I would strongly suggest sticking to her CD's and her music videos.  At least in her videos, she's able to dance without worrying about the sound of her voice.
