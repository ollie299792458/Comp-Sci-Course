I remember seeing Trancers on cable back in the mid-eighties. This film, although a very cheap B-movie, has got so much style that you can't help but love it. Obviously, the movie "borrows" much of its style and visuals from Blade Runner as well as the characterization of the protagonist, Jack Deth, but even so, Tim Thomerson's performance, a brilliant soundtrack, and a VERY original plot and story line combine to make Trancers a cult classic. The sequels never quite measured up to the original (which is usually the case), so the first film alone is worthy of any DVD collection. Aside from occasional foul language and "suggestive" sex scenes (no nudity), the older kids might be able to enjoy this one with mom or dad who probably remember seeing this one back when they were teenagers.

Bottom line: if you like action films, you gotta see this one. If you like sci-fi films: you gotta see this one. If you like Tim Thomerson, you gotta see this film.

What are you waiting for?
