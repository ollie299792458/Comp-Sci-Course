Last night I saw Sahara...the first movie that came to mind was National Treasure. While they are both similar with the 'treasure hunter' style/concept and the group of characters, I think they are both great.

Sahara is one of those rare movies that are appropriate for most age categories. The plot is a bit shaky. It goes back from one thing to another, and the end came quickly with some rushed 'tie-ups'.

There is a decent amount of action in this movie as well as mystery. Not orthodox suspense, but getting there. The movie starts with a bang, which really catches the viewers attention.

I think that I also liked this movie because of the humor in it. One of the characters is those funny/stupid personalities that really fits. For example, they're being chased by boat. One character gives the other a flare gun. The man replies To signal for help?....of course not! To shoot the guys with guns! See what I mean?

overall, this movie was great. I would definitely classify it in the category of National Treasure (also a great movie). If you liked National Treasure, you'll like Sahara.

I'd suggest seeing it on the big screen, while available. I think the price of admission is completely worth it.
