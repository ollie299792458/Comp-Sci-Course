Clue is a one-of-a-kind comedy bursting at the seams with laughter, lust, and back-stabbing suspense! The amount of talent brought together on camera in this film never ceases to amaze, nor disappoint, its viewers. Tim Curry  stars along with an incredible cast of big names living up to their fame  and, most certainly, having a great time together in doing so. This film  spin-off of the Clue board game brings to life all of its shady ,  high-profile characters and tosses them into action at a mysterious evening  gala. Blackmail is the central theme of the gathering, and all guests have  invitations to come settle their affairs with their would-be culprit... at  least, that's the basic theme! Things heat up when the resident help and  the imposter (or is he?) host soon fall victim to murder, and the entire  party bands together to do some hilarious misfit sleuthing. Sherlock Holmes  rolls over in his grave, but you'll be rolling on the floor laughing at the  seemingly endless barrage of puns, gags, and some of the best one-liners in  movie history. All in all, this film combines hilarious and witty comedy  with a surprisingly intricate twisting plot, delivered by the unforgettable  performance of the perfect cast. This is a must for Tim Curry fans, and any  lovers of truly pioneering titles in comedic art. Enjoy!
