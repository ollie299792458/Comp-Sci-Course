I was astounded that Disney could make a film that had been big-production into something more understated and downright beautiful. Disney had  intended to make "Annie" into something more realistic and  uncartoonish, and when I read about it at the Disney website I knew they  had succeeded. However, I love every version of "Annie" (even  "Annie: A Royal Adventure), and for those of you who can't believe  that is possible, you really should try to keep an open mind.  The acting  all around is wonderful. Alicia Morton makes Annie very sweet but not  fiesty, which is astounding because of her young age. Kathy Bates is  perfect in the interesting takeoff on Miss Hannigan, as older and  man-hating. And Victor Garber, what can I say? I greatly enjoyed the fact  that he LOOKED young enough to be Annie's father, which actually helped  make him more convincing because the character development suffers a bit.  He may have a fairly understated acting style, but when he sings  "Something is Missing" to Annie and asks if he could adopt her,  it makes for one of the most touching scenes in the film! Audra McDaniel is  perfect as Grace. Andrea McArdle makes a strong and sensational appearance  as the Broadway wannabe singing "NYC". "Easy Street",  and the people who played Rooster and Lily St. Regis, are top-notch.  Everyone sings marvelously, and the people who think they can't are way  wrong! All in all, I give this a 4.
