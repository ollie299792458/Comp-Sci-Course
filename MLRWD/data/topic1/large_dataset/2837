Wow what an accomplishment, forty years and twenty James Bond films. This is the longest running movie franchise in history. Other franchises could learn a thing or two from the Bond Film model. The Ultimate Edition is a must for any James Bond movie fan with all kinds of interesting "making of" and "behind the scenes" documentaries. As well as interviews and audio commentaries. Though I was disappointed that the "Inside..." documentaries featuring Patrick Macnee's narration stopped at License to Kill, there are enough extras to nearly make up for this oversight.

This bundle of box sets is really the way to go both for price and the fact that you get all the films at once. I really do not understand why the marketing "geniuses" at MGM/Sony pictures saw fit to place the movies into sets in such a random way.

The films' restoration and release to DVD may be a prelude to a Blu-Ray Disc release so you might be wise to wait awhile before buying the Bond films. Though if you are a big fan and can't wait this is the best way to buy them.
