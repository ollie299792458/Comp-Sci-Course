I bought this based on the many positive reviews here and at IMDb after hearing about it on an episode of Amazon's Fishbowl (Bill mentions it to the Indigo Girls).

It was a good movie but I highly doubt I will ever watch it again. It is too disturbing to enjoy watching over and over again. Most of the film is very slow-moving. My wife even called it boring though I wouldn't go that far. She said "There was no suspense, no action, not much story and hardly anything happened."

While I disagree, it wasn't as interesting as many reviews have you believe. Mostly, it is the story of a group of four guys who want to get away from it all for a weekend ride down the river with nothing more than nature. They bump into some people who disrupt their trip and change the stakes. Then there is some suspense in wondering who will kill whom, or if they will all get away safe in the end. That's pretty much it.

While it is a good look at the nature of man and what fear can do to even the best of us, I recommend renting it if you can rather than buying. Unless you have some extra cash to throw away, and then it's only a few dollars wasted I guess.
