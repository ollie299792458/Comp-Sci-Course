I saw this on Sundance and had to write this - I'm really not a big Wilco fan, I like their early stuff but found YHF unlistenable and self-absorbed. (I actually traded it in after I bought it). I really didnt have a problem with Tweedy in this - he struck me as a very low-key guy actually. As far as being a control freak, if he is, he has a right to be - the songs are HIS. But the major thing I wanted to write was the post-split speech given by Jay Bennett "It's obvious Jeff Tweedy feels threatened by me"... is one of the most hilarious spinal tap real-life moments I have ever seen!!! I almost hit the floor it was so inappropriately funny and off the wall. In my view the main personality in this movie was him - he showed himself to be a whining, threatened, control-freak poser. HE was the one who felt threatened, he played lead guitar and keyboards and the band had hired a guy to play keyboards (and who could also play guitar) - he simply couldnt handle it, he was trying to overcompensate and prove himself in every way. And, what was up with that HAIR??? He looked like a fat Minnesota housewife who just got back from a Jamaican cruise, lol. That one scene of him alone explaining his side of getting fired from his self-important, overly dramatic point of view, made the movie really.
