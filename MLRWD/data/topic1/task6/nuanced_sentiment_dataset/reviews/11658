I thought this was going to be total (...) like part 4, but I'm actually surprised. Though its connections with part 2 are not there (besides the now dead Grandpa and Leatherface-obv), we still get that good ol' 'Texas Chainsaw' madness we've all come to love and loathe. The acting isn't special, nor is the script, and Leatherface isn't nearly as eerie as the one Gunnar Hansen portrayed in the original, but this sequel/rehash is just good dumb fun with a fair amount of gore (sadly I do not own the uncut version). This is one of those franchises that cannot do much in the way of sequels, I mean you've got the first barbaric (and often funny original), then the crrraaazzzyyyy part 2 and the 'new family' of this instalment (oh and the terminally stupid part 4). Overall this film is nothing more than a toungue-in-cheek horror flick, but it's definatly not a bad film. I wonder if it will get a release here in Britain? Not that I care as I bought a copy from USA (God bless America)
Leatherface fans be sure not to miss out.
