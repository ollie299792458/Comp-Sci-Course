I would hate for anyone to miss out on such a great movie.  To say what happens right here in a review would be a crime.  Basically, the movie is about a photographer, L B Jeffries (James Stewart), who is stuck in his apartment due to a broken leg from his last assignment. To pass the time he turns to watching his neighbors.  This boring lifestyle is begining to make him sick, until something very unexpected happens.

After just watching Psycho and North by Northwest, Rear Window is definately my favorite.  Yes, Psycho has some unforgettable scenes and yes, North by Northwest is an exciting cross-country pursuit, but none of them have the same kind of suspense as Rear Window.  After all, "there is no terror in the bang, but in the anticipation of it" Alfred Hitchcock.

Following many of the usual Hitchcock themes, this movie turns out to be, objectively, his best.  If I had to recommend one movie to someoone who wanted to experience Hitchcock for the first time, this would be it.

Aside from the actual film, the picture has been restored very nicely, to make a great movie perfect.
