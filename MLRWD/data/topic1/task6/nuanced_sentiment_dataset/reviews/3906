I had a "cleaned up" version of this on video tape from when it was broadcast on TV years ago.  Was very nice to see the whole film not cropped.  It is so well done and so well produced it's uncanny!  Clothing, vehicles, music - everything.  Interior scenes.  It is EXACTLY what it was like in the 80's!  And the antics the lead character goes through were so similar to what I went through it was scary!  I just kept thinking over and over again, "That's Me!" The wild 80's clothes.  Bleaching the hair.  It was like watching a mirror reflection of my teenage years.

Coming out in the 80's wasn't easy and it sure as hell wasn't accepted!  It sure as hell wasn't as easily obtained either!  You did have to go on body language or eye movement or whatever.  There was no internet or dating websites or any of that crap.  The only way you knew who was gay was by word of mouth.  Just figuring it all out on your own and there was a certain beauty to that.  With today's internet, ANYTHING you have ever had a thought about is within 2 clicks of a mouse - BAM!  Right there on your computer screen.  There's no guesswork or fumbling.  You know it all before you even get out and try it.

The 80's was the last of the "innocent" eras.  Watching this movie my chin was on the ground because it was so realistic and it was so interesting to think, "Wow!  I had that sweater!"  or "Wow!  I had that record!"  The "new wave" music that was used is EXACTLY the same music I listened to back then which was considered "gay".  It was interesting to see that the same things you thought or experienced, somebody else did too during that era.  Coming from small town America it was thrilling to watch this movie and see the similarities even in a larger city.  And I even worked in an amusement park too!  So it REALLY was like telling the story of my life.  Cute, funny, serious - it handles all the topics tastefully and very well.  KUDOS!
