After watching Capote, I found myself on a Philip Seymour Hoffman kick. Having enjoyed his performance in Boogie Nights, along with the rest of the film, I decided to watch Magnolia.

I wasn't disappointed.

Magnolia has one of the most interesting openers a movie has ever had. An opener that warns us that coincidence and fate have a peculiar method of showing themselves sometimes.

And that's the theme of the movie. This movie presents us characters, who are in some way connected to one another, either by family means, personality traits, or just fate and coincidence.

I came into this move just for Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting skills. I was rewarded with that and so much more.

Every performance done in this movie are performances to be admired. Yes, even Tom Cruise's.

Tom has been getting a lot of bad press lately, but don't let that affect your judgement in watching this movie. In fact, you won't care about Tom Cruise's mishaps, you'll care about Frank T. J. Mackey's.

I believe Tom does his best performance in this movie. One scene in particular, Tom shows was he's capable of in a matter of seconds.

And the rest of this great cast all have their moments to shine. John C. Reilly as a down on his luck cop, Jason Robards as a dying tv. show producer with a lot of regret, his wife, played by Julianne Moore, Philip Baker Hall as the TV host with a skeleton's in his closet, William H. Macey as the run down old game show quiz kid, and Jeremy Blackman as the new game show quiz kid.

Paul Thomas Anderson's wonderful follow-up to Boogie Nights has been overlooked by many.

And that's a shame.

What happens towards the end of the movie is worth the price alone.
