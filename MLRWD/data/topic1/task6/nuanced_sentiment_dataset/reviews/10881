The film is great and would have received 4 stars alone for the film.  Unfortunately this DVD version does not do much justice for the film.  I would recommend getting the Criterion DVD version of this film instead of  this particular DVD release.
I say this due to the fact that this  particular DVD version did not offer too much extra in comparison to the  VHS version.  The qualities of the DVD version are the standard DVD  advantages of clean picture and chapter index.
There were not too many  extras -- all it had were the trailer and recommended film section which  quite frankly, was hokey (stillshot of 3 movie boxes).  The advantages of  DVD with all the extras beyond subtitling and extra trailer were lost on  this copy.  An example would be the fact that Rushmore has a *sweet*  soundtrack but no advantage was derived such as a seperate soundtrack  section with lyrics or contact info for the bands (lost marketing  opportunity there).
Anyway, get the the Criterion collection version of  this film because it does more justice to the film than this DVD version.  If you just want to watch the film without all the extra goodies that DVD  provides then buy the VHS at the lower price point.
