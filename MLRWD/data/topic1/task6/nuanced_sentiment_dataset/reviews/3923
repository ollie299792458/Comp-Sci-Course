Discouraging for any fan of the film.
This is an excellent work that deserves a better transfer.  Despite extras, including director commentary, after waiting years for this to be released on DVD, I read the box with dismay that the film was presented "Matted" widescreen, basically it appears that the top and bottom portions of the film are cut-off to make it appear widescreen.  It gives the film a claustophobic look and was truly irritating when the top of Sean Connery's Head was lopped off in one scene!  It's hard not to cry "For Shame" after such a long wait.  It amazes me that this was not released in proper anamorphic widescreen.  Heck, even a standard format probably would have looked better!
My only hope is that a few other films have been re-worked later, such as Stephen King's Needful Things, which was first only released in Standard Format and Later Given Proper Widescreen Release.
Film itself is still a marvelous and under-rated masterpiece, and extras are very good, so I gave 3 stars, but whoever apparently decided to crop the film should be tried by the Holy Inquisition and burned at the stake (or at least forced to re-release properly). This is blasphamy to collectors and we take no pleasure from this defect!
