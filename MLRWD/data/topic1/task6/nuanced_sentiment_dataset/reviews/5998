As the Coen brothers did in Fargo, Affleck does a wonderful job of making the place character in the movie. High speed chases down narrow Boston streets and the feel of the Charlestown community let you know that this is a story about a place and not just people. But, apparently unlike 90 percent of other viewers, that's about the extent of the praise I can offer this film, one I really wanted and expected to like.

It simply crumbles under the weight of its implausibility and unbelievability. The smart girl gets blinded by the love for an outlaw theme is really played out by now. Like Tara in "Sons of Anarchy" Claire makes me want to hit her over the head more than connect with her. I guess Jon Hamm is just too good looking to be portrayed as a bumbling lawman on the tail of a cunning criminal, but that's almost the impression one gets. There's just too much that doesn't makes sense about these two characters to accept what happens in the story.

The ending, if you can call it an ending, while it seems touching on the surface, leaves at least two very important unanswered questions that one has to ask when following through the result to its logical conclusion.

The lead and supporting performers are all strong, and Affleck's handling of the place and action were well-crafted. He needs to pick a better story (and possibly another lead actor) for his next directorial effort though.
