It is worth reminding what the real heroes of those events thought about the movie. When it was first screened in St. Petersburg, the survivors of the nuclear submarine disaster could not hide ironic smiles, yet at the end of the film, the veterans rose to applaud the fantasy-filled story of human courage. The craft's navigator, Valentin Shabanov said that only two things in the film were true: the bottle of champagne did not break when the submarine was launched and an accident with the reactor; the rest "are tales from Uncle Sam." Although the plot is based on real-life events, producers added psychological drama to the storyline by clashing hard-nosed captain Ford against his more compassionate second-in-command in a stand-off culminating in a riot. "For the crew to disobey the captain. It is unthinkable," said the craft's powerline supervisor Boris Kuzmin. "There was no panic at all. And the guns -- they are sealed in a safebox and few people know where it is. As for handcuffs, in 1961 even police did not have them. Forget about the submarine." The Russian sailors said they had vetoed the first script of the film, which contained such scenes as a Russian officer sitting on top of the reactor and drinking vodka. Even the Director Kathryn Bigelow, admitted that the team added imaginary conflict to the story for the benefit of the viewer. Despite their reservations, the K-19 veterans were unanimous in giving high marks to the film which for the first time in Hollywood history portrayed Soviet servicemen as heroes.
