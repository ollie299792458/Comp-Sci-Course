TOTSM tells the always-timely tale of greed and treachery that is often told but never heeded. It tells how men who start out with good intentions can become blind to gold and material wealth. It is one of the best films to tell this tale. Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs is his greatest role. Bogart's greed is contrasted by Walter Huston's Christ-like figure (he is treated as a savior by the farmers) who has seen what "gold does to men's souls" in his long life. Howard has a clear conscience, no need for material wealth, is more concerned with helping save the young boy and loves the simpler things in life. Tim Holt's Curtain becomes Howard's apostle who starts out green and naive and is tempted at times but is influenced more by Howard's wisdom and morality than greed for gold.  
The snap-n-crack dialog would make even Quentin Tarantino envious. Some of the best lines ever written. 
*Hey mister can you stick a fellow American to a meal?
*Waters precious sometimes it can be more precious than gold.
*You gotta know how to tickle it so she comes out laughing.
*When are we going to start dividing it up?
*If you know what's good for ya you won't monkey around with
  Fred C. Dobbs.
There are many more. Alfonso Bedoya's "badges" line has got to be one of the most quoted ever. This has been #1 on my DVD release wish list and I can't wait to get it. Modern remakes have been done but go with the original. If you like this watch "The Man Who Would Be King" also directed by John Huston which explores similar themes.
