Had this movie been released 5-6 years ago, it probably would have made a huge impact in both story and technical achievement.  Unfortunately, we've seen this movie many times before with the likes of Madagascar, Over the Hedge, Shrek, Hoodwinked, and even the 2d animated Emperor's New Groove .  Animals that venture out into the woods to learn 'valuable life lessons'(Madagascar); the big calm, collective character vs. the small annoying, hyper character (Shrek and Emperor's New Groove), and animals constantly finding themselves out of their habitat (all of the movies).

  Not only is the storyline hardly original, the main characters played by Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher don't quite gel together well.  Funny moments are few and far in between.  The animals (skunks) with the stereotypical 'black attitude' formula has been beaten to death in this movie as well.

  Sony, along with Pixar need to put the 'animals in peril' storyline in the shelf once and for all and start coming up with fresh ideas.  The last great 3d animated experience that was released as of late seems to be last years 'Monster House'; technically astounding and original storyline, not to mention very funny HUMAN characters.

Don't get me wrong, the 3D movie studios are great at what they do.  Being a student of 3d animation myself, I can certainly understand the hard work they go through to make movies like this.  The truth remains, however, that beautiful 3d images and animation alone don't make for a great movie.
