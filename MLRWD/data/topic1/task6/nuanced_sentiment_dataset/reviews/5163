Okay, let's make things clear:  This movie isn't perfect.  It's a big bloated explod-a-thon, similar to the Transformers movies.  It should have been MUCH better, considering the source material.
That said, it IS pretty good.  If you go into it expecting it to be just as good as the movie in your head when you read the comics, you will be disappointed.  But, it's far less cheesy than the cartoon, and hits a bunch of little easter eggs for fans of the comic.  A few examples: In a flashback, we see Storm Shadow fleeing after 'killing' the Hard Master - except that we don't actually see him make the kill.  We just see him running away, and he could easily have been chasing someone.
Another tiny little nod - Breaker steals a piece of double-bubble gum from Duke.  It makes no sense in the movie, unless you know that Breaker eats bubble gum in the comic, and they constantly had ads for double-bubble within it's pages.
There are lots of others like that.  In fact my one big beef with the movie is their handling of the Baroness at the end, and mainly because it completely violates the established canon.  The Baroness is supposed to be evil, without excuses.  They make her only evil because she has been 'brainwashed.'  Insulting to the character.
Still, for Joe fans, it was certainly worthy of the name, and I hope they make the sequel better still.
