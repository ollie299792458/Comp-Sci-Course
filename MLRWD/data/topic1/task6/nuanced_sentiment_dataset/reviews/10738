When I first purchesed this movie I was so exited, little did I know that it was less then steller. I wanted to think that the other reviewers were exagerating how disappointing it was.  But I found them to be correct.  Don't get me wrong if you are a fan buy it, it's still a fun change from  the monotony of the series. I just want to warn the non avid monnie fan to  watch the R movie before this one and not to expect it to be great.  The  storyline was also hard to follow ,and the voices of the outer sailors were  pethetic. Why mini moon? Sailor chibi moon/rini is called mini moon what  moron came up with that. It was still fun to see the outer scouts attacks  and tranformations.  And you get to see luna as a human,they should leave  her that way.  As a jupiter fan I was unhappy that she had very little talk  time.  The movie again focused on serena and darian's love.  Their in love  enough already.  I would like to see the other scouts get the spotlight for  a while. So I want to caution potential veiwers you won't really fully  enjoy this movie unless you are a hard core moon fan.
