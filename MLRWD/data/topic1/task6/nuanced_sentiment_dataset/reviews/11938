So as far the the blu-ray itself goes its a nice product! The video and audio are done very well. Some of the special features were nice, but none were anything I'd watch over again. As far as the movie itself... I give it a big thumbs down. The way the movie started I literally new in the first 5 minutes exactly how this was going to end. My girlfriend did not believe me, so I wrote it down on a piece of paper. At the end of the movie she opened it up and guess who was right!? Me! If you've never seen a "twist ending" movie before then maybe you should watch this cause it "might shock you." If you are a movie person I think you will be very disappointed by this. It was EXTREMELY predictable scene after scene after scene and reminded me of SOOOO many other movies. This gets 3 stars because the cinematography was beautiful and the acting was done very well! All in all however unless you have a crush on Leo, I'd rent this movie on blu or dvd (cause the visuals weren't THAT astounding) but I'd avoid the purchase. If you wanna buy a Leo movie I've gotta suggest What's Eating Gilbert Grape; Blood Diamond; The Deprated; or even Inception.
