For once Karajan does something I can stand.

OK, that's not fair, he was good at live precision-comedies when he was young, and his ROSENKAVALIERs and FALSTAFFs are standard-setting.  Let's say, for once ELDERLY Karajan does something I can stand.

The main thing this performance gets right is the weakness of the characters.  Furlanetto is not a power-singer nor a giant nor even a true basso; his King's principle emotion is fear and his impotence is evident from the first note.  It's OK, the King is weak, but it's supposed to reveal itself gradually.  Jose Carraras' weakness is more appropriate.  Even Piero Cappuccilli's Roderigo seems worried and depressed rather than reckless, as if he knows what's coming.  Self-confidence is reserved for Matti Salminen's super-athletic Grand Inquisitor, and Franco de Grandis' Old Monk/Carlo Quinto.  Grandis is one of two singers this performance introduced me to that I'd like to hear a lot more of; the other is Fiamma Izzo d'Amico.  Every sound she makes is gorgeous and she's SOOOOO hot.  For once we can see, rather than imagining, a young Elizabetta.  (There's another good thing about Karajan--his long series of proteges specializing in ultra-feminine, ultra-vulnerable heroines.)

I don't know how old Agnes Baltsa is but she still has her gifts.

The staging and costumes are excellent too.
