I stayed away from the theatrical release of Chronicles of Riddick. At the time the reviews made it clear the studio executives ruined a good premise by hacking it down to appeal to a teenaged audience. However, I picked up the "unrated directors cut" hoping that it would be good, and I was right!

Maybe it was my lowered expectations, but I thought this movie was awesome. For me, this was the best epic, pure escapist Sci-fi I've seen since "Empire Strikes Back". The visuals and sound was top notch. The concept of a marauding army of half-deads converting and killing whole planets is straight out of "Heavy Metal". Riddick was exactly as I remembered him - hard core. As in Pitch Black, it becomes clear in the end there is a heart beneath the cold-blooded exterior. I've read a lot of the reviews here, so I won't repeat what's already written. I will say that if you grew up loving "Heavy Metal", "Conan the Barbarian" or other escapist "B movies", you'll get a huge kick out of this film. I know I did.
