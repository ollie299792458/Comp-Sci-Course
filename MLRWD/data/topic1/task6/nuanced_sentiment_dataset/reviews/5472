Why would I give dreck like "Hollow Man" two stars?  Because, simply, it shows that you can have the best special effects in the world, and it doesn't mean anything if you put them in the wrong story.  Here's the thing: I *love* the concept of the Invisible Man for a horror movie.  It lends itself to perfect, Hitchcockian suspense: you just point the camera at a person alone in their room, doing ordinary things, and the audience will go out of their minds wondering if that person is as alone as they appear to be.  No special effects whatsoever are necessary.  "Hollow Man" by contrast, has some really amazing special effects.  I will give it that much, but so what?  The whole point of having an invisible man is not knowing where he will be at a given time.  This movie actually goes to great pains to make damn sure you know exactly where Kevin Bacon is at all times, and left me wondering why invisibility, specifically, was the plot device.  It could have just as easily been, say, super-strength, and the plot would be essentially no different.  I figure that if a great movie featuring an invisible man is ever made again, it will be made by low-budget moviemakers who simply can't afford special effects.
