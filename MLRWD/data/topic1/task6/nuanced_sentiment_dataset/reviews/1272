Good Will Hunting is one of those films that I wasn't expecting much, since the writers, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are so young.  But surprisingly this young duo was able to write a sophisticated script that, with the direction of Gus Van Sant, became an Academy Award winner.  Those awards, Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Screenplay definitely show the movies strong points.  Unfortunately the acting is a little wooden and awkward at times, but is forgivable.

Luckily this movie has great bonus features including my favorite, audio commentary with Gus Van Sant, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.  Also included are 11 deleted scenes with audio commentary, production featurette, and "Miss Misery" music video.  In other words this DVD is loaded.

Overall, with all the bonus material and sophisticated story this is definitely a great rental.  If on the other hand, you are huge fans of Ben and Matt, and have already seen it and loved the movie, then it really is a no-brainer, just buy it.
