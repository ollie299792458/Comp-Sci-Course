The stress of family and in-laws during the holidays and how we wish we could avoid it on full display. This is not an Oscar caliber movie at all but was an entertaining holiday family reunion comedy. Reese & Vaughn's chemistry was funny but seemed to be weak in the romance area. Only a mild spark came through the screen. They didn't seem to fit romantically real well but was not a serious flaw. Fit as good as some real life couples I know so not unrealistic.

Vince and the vomit scenes are just too funny. He does the manic goofball well here. Good cast executing a silly comedy in a respectable way. I like most all of Vaughn and Reese's work to date. There is more to these two than a lot of other Hollywood types.

This not a classic but still a cut above some of the junk coming out lately. Some story plots telegraphed but this is seems to be the norm too often, including big budget and acclaimed movies too. Hey movie makers we're not stupid and can handle a surprise! (Even been known to be able to follow a book) Light fun with good supporting cast.

Give it a look and you will be surprised. Solid 4 stars. (To some other reviewers: one star, really? 2-4 range I see but one?)
