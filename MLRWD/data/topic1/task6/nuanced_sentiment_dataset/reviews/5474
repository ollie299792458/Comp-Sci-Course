This travesty ranks right up there with such notably disastrous stage to screen transfers such as A Chorus Line, Mame, Man of La Mancha, Hello Dolly, Camelot, South Pacific just to name a few.  The sad thing here is this could have been an extraordinary classic movie musical considering how wonderful the original stage version was.  It's as if the producers and director got together to purposely turn this into a cheap, ugly sideshow.  Nothing, absolutely nothing works.  The added songs are unbelievably bad, the choreography is appalling!  Did you notice the dance number in Warbucks house where you can see the girls underwear during some of the kicks? Shocking!  Bernadette Peters and Carol Burnett are rediculous due to bad writing and direction.  Aileen Quinn is about as likable as watching OJ Simpson on the golf course.  I remember when I saw this film in the theatres when it first came out and sitting there with my mouth open in disbelief.  What can you say about a director who takes the most popular song in the show and only uses it over the main title?  Thank God John Huston did not direct any other musicals!  I am not too keen on the Disney version either but it is far superior to this garbage.
