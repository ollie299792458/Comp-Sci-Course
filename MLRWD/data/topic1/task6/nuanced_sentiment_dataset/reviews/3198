I deleted my original review. I was so shocked by Angelina Jolie's appearance, or changed appearance is more accurate, to settle down and "taken in" the movie as I might have. The one thing writers and directors strive to impart in their characters is to bring out at least one facet in the role that the viewers connect with or find appealing...in other words, the good guys are suppose to be liked by the audience on some level. This film role for Jolie was flat and single faceted...no emotional or kindred spirit the viewers could have invested any rousing interest in, or even like very much. Her wardrobe was as flat and benign as her role. One would not have been surprised to have it suddenly revealed that she is really an emotion less clone of the real woman she is supposed to be. I couldn't help wondering what the director was aiming for...certainly no positive connection with the viewers. The plot of the film is very good and deserved a much better delivery from the director. THAT much I DID take in. Johnny Depp? Looking unkempt and careless with his grooming works for Pirates of the Caribbean. All it does in this film is sharpen the contrast between his character and Joli's to the point of being an impossible to accept. I think it was the hair growing over his lips and his truly nasty looking stained teeth that plopped him into the "yuck" category. What a shame all the way around.....when the characters are directed in such a way as to distract the viewers from the actual plot, well...you end up with a great plot that remains unfulfilled and dead in the water; one not all the action/special effects scenes can keep afloat.  As for the reviewers who found Jolie and Depp's performances captivating enough to hold their interest, may I suggest "Pee Wee's Big Adventure", and  "Muppet Take New York'? Trust me, you'll be glued to the screen.
