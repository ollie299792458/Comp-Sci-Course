Yes, there is the scene where Omar Sharif makes love to Lesley-Anne Down in the dark, taking advantage of the fact that she does not know that he is not Clouseau.  HOWEVER, in the original film (previously issued on DVD, and now missing), Sharif then sings to Down "Come to Me", which is the set-up to the joke at the end when the real Clouseau sings to her in his own bed, and she comments on his voice, noting in her surprised reaction how different it is from what she heard before.

So, what's the problem with releasing an entire movie on DVD, instead of additional selective edits?  There are certainly no shortage of substandard "director's cuts" where we get everything that should have remained on the cutting room floor, but for a modern classic, why do this???  And where's the disclaimer on the box that warns the consumer that they are NOT getting the entire original movie?

With decisions like this, Hollywood deserves every lost nickel of revenue from writer's strikes, actor's strikes, etc.
