Having thoroughly enjoyed the films of Wong Kar-wai, I rented Eros primarily to see "The Hand," a short piece which Wong contributed to the anthology. For fans of Wong, and, for that matter, cinema in general, this segment will not disappoint. Indeed, "The Hand" is a classy, erotically charged and truly heart-rending exploration of the director's favorite themes: unrequited love; memory; and alienation. Well casted and beautifully choreographed, Gong Li and Chang Chen positively shine through their character's respective sadness. It is, quite simply, a phenomenal short piece, and, while it may not approach the brilliance of full lengths like In the Mood for Love, 2046 and Chunking Express, it clearly stands above all of Wong's other short film projects.

The second segment, Steven Soderbergh's "Equilibrium," pales in comparison, but, all in all, it is an enjoyable, if overly campy, short revolving around one man's attempt to interpret an ethereal and mildly romantic recurring dream. Tragically, the final piece, Michelangelo Antonioni's "The Dangerous Thread of Things," isn't worth the film stock it was shot on. Boring, shallow characters act out an unnecessarily drama-ridden, forcibly arty and utterly dull tryst which marries unengaging, unadulterated soft porn with failed, overblown symbolism. All things considered, there can be no disputing the fact that Eros is an utter failure when viewed as an anthology or portmanteau film; that said, "The Hand" is worth pursuing, irrespective of how it is presented and/or packaged.
