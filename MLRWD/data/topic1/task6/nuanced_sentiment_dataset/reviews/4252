From someone who read the novel first, the movie didn't shock me as much as it has some of the other reviewers. The overuse of indecent language was to be expected from a story so full of sexual innuendo. Raquel Welch, who is so stunningly gorgeous for a transsexual in this film, and Mae West tried so very hard to save the movie. The scene in which the two share dialogue is confusing though, partly because the camera never spans so that you can see both women on the screen. The intense close-ups on the two women make it seem as though they were shot separately. Despite being mildly entertained by film's portrayal of Hollywood in the 1960s, Mae West's musical number was one of the two things that kept me going through the entire film, other than the random implanting of classic film scenes throughout that would jar me from my blank staring. &#61514; This movie might be considered great for those who enjoy the loathsome films of that era, but for me, it just didn't do anything. Well, ok. It did do one thing. It made me laugh. But I wasn't laughing with the film, I was laughing at it. ;)
