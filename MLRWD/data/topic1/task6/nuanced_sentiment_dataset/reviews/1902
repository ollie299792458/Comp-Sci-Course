The first story arc of the anime, Bleach, is one of the most unforgetable and captivating stories I have ever seen in an anime. Ichigo, who along with  some members of his family, possesses the unique ability to see lingering spirits. This ability however gets him into trouble whenever an evil spirit called a hollow comes after him looking to devour his soul. He is saved by a Soul Reaper named Rukia, who is badly injured in the process. Soon enough the hollow comes back and the only way Ichigo can save his family from the hungry spirit is to become a soul reaper himself by sapping the powers out of the incapacitated Rukia. However in doing this he gets a lot more than he bargained for. Because Rukia gave him her powers of as a soul reaper she is unable to perform her duties(killing hollows, sending spirits to the other side, etc.) and Ichigo must do it in her stead. This series of events sends him on an unforgetable roller coaster ride of adventures that eventually brings him to the gates of the spirit world. If you are a fan of good anime, this is a season you absolutely have to own. Buy it, its worth the 70 dollars(psst dont buy it from amazon. u dont need to pay 200 dollars! your local best buy has it for 70!) Look forward to the release of the boxed second season. It is way better than this as hard as that is to believe, but trust me you will thoroughly enjoy this animme.
