Based on the classic novel by Charles Dickens, this is a modern version of a story about infatuation, obsession, love, heartbreak, the realization of dreams and the value of loyalty.  As a boy in a small Florida fishing town, Finn meets Estella, a pretty, but cold and distant girl who becomes Finn's complete obsession.  Years later, as young adults in New York City, Finn and beautiful Estella meet again.  Finn's passion for Estella fuels his ambition to succeed in life, and he believes his success will draw her closer to him and ultimately win her love.

This is an amazing movie that hasn't received near the attention that it deserves.  It shows all emotions to the fullest, especially the intensity of passion and the pain of heartbreak.  Both women AND men would enjoy it because it affects the emotional characteristics that are in everyone.  It was filmed in such a way that it could be described as a moving work of art, with beautiful use of light and the color green, among other eye-catching features.  The actors did a fantastic job playing their characters, including Ethan Hawke as the ambitious and passionate Finn, Gwyneth Paltrow as the stunning and unfeeling Estella, Anne Bancroft as the eccentric and bitter Ms. Dinsmoor and Robert De Niro as the intimidating yet compassionate escaped convict.  This is a must-see for anyone who enjoys a good story told on a deeply emotional level along with the visual beauty of great filmmaking.
