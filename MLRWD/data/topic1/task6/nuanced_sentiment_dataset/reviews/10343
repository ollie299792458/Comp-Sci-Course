A History of Violence is a thoughtful, if violent movie. It serves as proof that Viggo Mortensen can act outside of Lord of the Rings, and features other great performances from a talented cast, including Maria Bello, Ed Harris, and William Hurt.

Set in a small-town Midwest setting, the story starts with an attempted robbery in a diner (which most certainly would have ended with the death of the patrons and staff of the diner), and leads into the unraveling of main character Tom Stall's (VM) life, as big-city mobsters are drawn to the small town by the TV coverage, believing Stall to be a long-missing mobster. Tom's family structure is put under ever-increasing tension by the presence of the obsters, their allegations, and the growing suspicion within the family. Throughout, Stall fights for the family life he has built over the years.

The movie is well-directed, with tension building and building, along with our sympathy for Stall. The violence shows up infrequently, but with a stacatto-like precision that does not relieve the tension, but rather adds to it. In the end, there may be hope for Stall, that his family may pull itself back together, and this is a fitting closing.

Howard Shore did the soundtrack for the movie. It's a good soundtrack, but since I did know this going into the theatre, I found it a little distracting, as sometimes there are (perhaps imagined) echoes of the LOTR soundtrack.

This is not a movie for young children. Once again, I was disturbed by how young children were in a movie with brutal violence. When you hear a five-year-old ask "Is that the bad man?" in the theatre, you have to wonder.

A definite recommendation here!
