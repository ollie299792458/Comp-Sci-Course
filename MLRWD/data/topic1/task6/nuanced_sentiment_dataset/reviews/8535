Not being fond of any form of jingoism, the sight of the American flag in the very first frame of this film had me reaching for the "Off" button. However I persevered and found this to be a competent but not particularly inspiring film about a couple's view of what an all-American family should be. The script is functional, production values OK but acting in this film was very uneven. Its not so much that the protagonists were not particularly engaging, but that Jim Carey in a minor role - an actor whose work I hadn't much liked till now - showed a real depth of interpretation that was well beyond anything achieved by any of the other actors.

I think the ground covered by this movie has been covered much more competently by other movies such as Todd Haynes' beautifully filmed Far From Heaven [perfect American family disrupted by husband's homosexuality & progressive wife's relationship with her gardener in a less tolerant age] and the well scripted and acted French film Just a Question of Love [self-oppression and parent's difficulty in accepting their gay son - don't be put off by the schmaltzy title.]

In comparison, Doing Time on Maple Drive is inoffensive but pedestrian.
