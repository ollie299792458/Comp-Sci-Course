If ever there was a movie deserving of all that DVD has to offer, this is it. The Abyss was neglected upon it's original theatrical release and it was only the later released special edition, restoring (and completing) the finale that gave this sci-fi/romance masterpiece the attention it deserves.  If you have only seen he theatrical version and dismissed it as "ET underwater" or "Close Encounters of the Wet Kind" then you owe it to yourself to enjoy this movie the way it was meant to be seen.  Beg, buy, borrow, or steal this DVD to see the Special Edition in crisp clean digital picture and mind blowing sound.  The bonus material will keep you busy for hours including the one hour making of documentary as well as nearly 30 chapters of information on every aspect of filming from casting to the restoration.  Each vehichle/submercible gets it's own chapter as well as the famous wave sequence and a truly amazing (and sometimes humorous) look at the creation of the pseudopod sequence making use of DVD's multiple angle feature to allow you to switch between storyboards, raw footage, in process effects shots and the final footage.
Aside from marveling at the amount of care and detail that went into making the film, the special edition also brings even greater resinance to the love story- the true heart and soul of The Abyss.  Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio have never been better.  Watch the special edition movie on disc 1 then dig in to the ultimate DVD treat on disc 2.
