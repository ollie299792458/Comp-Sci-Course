"Rushmore" and "Bottle Rocket" the two most sincere movies of the 90's I believe. They are so true to life and have so many good actors in it. I'll start with "Bottle Rocket." As I was  watching this my father said, "This is horrible acting." The  later he said,"Wait...they aren't acting. They're being human."  And that's what it is with both of these movies. Being human...showing life  for what it is and not what you see in the movies and on TV. Life isn't  perfect...but it sure as hell can be funny. Wes Anderson is brilliant. In  Bottle Rocket Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson are great. One of my favorite  movies of all times. Then there's "Rushmore"...it is my favorite  movie of all times. It's so sincere and real, and touching and funny and  it's a blethera of emotions. I felt sorry for the characters, I laughed at  them, and I felt their pain. Love stinks. Jason Shwartzman is great as Max  Fischer, and Mason Gamble is great as his little fried...I see he's moving  on to good roles from "Dennis the Menace." Bill Murray shows his  true acting talents for once. I mean, Bill Murray was hilarious  before...but now he's respectable. Olivia Williams is pleasant as the  teacher both of them are ga-ga over, but she doesn't really have that much  to do with her role. The whole movie leaves me with a smirk on my face.  Life can be funny is what both of these movies teach us. It can be really  funny. Bad things happen so later in life we can make jokes about it. And  that's what these movies show I think. They are real as you'll ever get, no  Hollywood BANG! This is life people, and you will crack up at it. Just see  these two movies. They will make you actual use your brain when you are  watching a comedy.
