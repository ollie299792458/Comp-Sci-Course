Guess what, men can be just as vain about our looks as women.  True we do not like to be seen as preening ourselves in front of mirrors.  And there is belief of the ruggedly manly looks of an outdoors man.  But if we admit it to ourselves when a man first sees the tired sag in his jowl line, the beginning of crow's feet at the corners of his eyes and the lines at the corners of his mouth growing.  Well, most men will at the very lest begin to wonder where the years have gone and is it down hill from here.  Will he end up wearing his father's face?

Come on guys, we all know when we start to reach a certain age that is in the back of our mind.
