I won't do a movie review, since that has been done by many others, but I do want to comment on the DVD.  I did not get the 25th anniversary edition (no booklet or commentary), but I did get the wide-screen version.  I had the video version, but could not bear to watch it because of the full-screen aspect and the things you missed.  I have seen the movie before, in a theater.

Saying that, I was really dismayed and disturbed by the lack of quality of the transfer to the DVD.  The sound quality was the worst, with background noises completely drowning out the conversation (and I am careful not to include the scenes where that was intentional--there were a number of scenes on the DVD where you literally could not hear the dialogue because of wind noise, door slams, ice clinking, etc.).  There were times when the sound just blared at you, and other times you had to strain to hear, sometimes in the same scene.  Again, I know when a director is intentionally using sound to set up a scene, and I have seen this movie before, so I know what it is supposed to sound like.

The quality of the picture was lacking at times as well, but the biggest gripe is the sound.  It really distracted me from the movie, and is a reason I am giving the DVD away.  I want to have the movie in my collection, just not this DVD.
