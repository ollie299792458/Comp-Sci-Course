The story was weak, the acting was terrible and the dancing was awesome. This move got high ratings for 3d. My opinion? the 3d sucked. I have a 100 inch screen and my 3d is done with a projector and a 3d converter. 3D movies look awesome with my setup. Other 3D movies I bought from amazon is "Under the Sea", "Legends of the Guardians", and "Alice in Wonderland". These movies had awesome 3D effect.

This Stepup movie 3D was by far the worst out of my 3D collection. I was tricked by other reviews saying the 3D in this movie was on par if not better than Avatar. Lies. Unless Avatar had sucky 3D! Maybe it's just me but I watched this entire movie almost cross-eyed. The 3D effect was maybe too strong? When it popped, it was too double imagey and it gave me a headache. There were moments in my other 3D movies in which I saw double but not this much. It was like the whole film and I wanted to watch the movie in 2D instead but the problem is I would be stuck with a crappy movie in 2D instead of 3D crap. Putting crap in 3D automatically makes it better normally. Not in this case.

So I'm stuck with a horrible movie with horrible 3D with the only redeeming value is the nifty 3D cover. I wish I could rent 3d movies from netflix.
