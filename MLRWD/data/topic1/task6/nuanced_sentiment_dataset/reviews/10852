It's hard to believe that this movie was produced in 1945, a year which introduced Americans to the twin horrors of the Nazi concentration camps and the effects of the atomic bomb. Although the later two concerns have been greatly distanced from our current social and political conscienceness,  the widespread plague of alcoholism remains painfully relevant.
  Being a recovering alcoholic myself, I am amazed at how openly Bily Wilder shows us the uglier sides of the alcoholic personality: the lying, the stealing, the self-righteous anger towards anyone or anything that interferes with our drinking. This movie goes WAY outside the comfort zone of American society at that time. The fact that it was a box office success and won 4 Oscars cknowledges that, even then, America knew that it had a problem of epidemic proportions on its hands.
  All of the grim realities of a binge are portrayed here: the blackouts,  the depression, the panic, even the DTs. Ray Milland gives the performance of his life in the Lost Weekend, a man perched on the perimeter of his own damaged psyche. This film, much more than many of the preachy videos curently employed in treatment centers, can help a struggling alcoholic  to take a hard lok in the mirror, and possibly help them want to make a change for the better.
  Several modern films  may capture the details of alcoholism more acurately (Leaving Las Vegas tops the list), but none of these would ever have been made without the groundwork laid by The Lost Weekend.
