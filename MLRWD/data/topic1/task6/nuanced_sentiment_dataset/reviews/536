Overall, Teens 14 and over should be fine, and so sad, but kids 10 thru 16 are gonna make this huge on DVD

You talk about a series that has run out of steam. I did not laugh once during this terrible movie. I didn't think I'd see anything as unfunny as Scary Movie 3, but boy was I wrong. First of all, you can see these jokes coming a mile away, and then you hear them delivered with no feeling or emotion at all. It's as if the actors knew this wasn't funny and just wanted there paycheck. This will be ranked #3 in my top 10 worst of 2006.......so far!!!
