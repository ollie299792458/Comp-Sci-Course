Anyone who calls this a snooze fest is scared to death of themselves.  This is a true love story.  Its about a romance that keep people alive whether they dream of it or in this case actually get to live it.  I hope someday to meet Mr Eastwood and Ms. Streep and thank them for doing this movie.
Watch the movie, read the book and dont be ashamed to cry and to dream and cry some more.  It's ok.  It's a beautiful story of something so special that few us ever get to feel.  I am a deep romatic and love to write love songs and play them on my guitar.
I have been married to my wife for 26 yrs.  We dream of finding someone who really cares about us and appreciates us and doesnt take us for granted. Some people are threatened by those who can openly share there dreams and secrets.  They are ahsamed of being.  I dream of true love and romance.  To find someone to slow dance with under the stars to the music of each others hearts.....  Someone to hold hands with, and feel so damn happy you pray to God it will never end.  Thats what this movie and story does for me.  Cheers.
