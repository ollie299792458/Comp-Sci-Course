Kikujiro is the only movie that I can remember ever pushing the fast-forward button while watching. Perhaps I have come to expect too much of the Japanese cinema over the past few years, or perhaps my desire for new stories, an intelligent script and good cinematography has left a cold rock buried in my chest for anything less than excellent, but I would consider Kikujiro far from mediocre, and that is being generous. 
Kikujiro is an old story that is told around the globe at least once a year. It has been a long standing theory of mine that a child as the main character of a film can either make or break a film. In this case, the young boy "Masao" breaks the film. Masao has one reaction to every single interaction that takes place in the film: he bows his head, lowers his eyes and sticks his lip out. This is what the boy does during the entire film, and by the 20th time within the first five minutes of the film you can't help but wonder if there is anything more to the character of this child and the film itself. There isn't.  
But to blame the blunder of the film upon this one child would make me a simpleton. The script to Kikujiro is not clever. Some films show their mastery through their ability to communicate through short scripts (Kurosawa's "Madadayo"), but Kikujiro's two page script is short of a soul. This film moves slowly, not carefully or beautifully, and the different scenes are completely non sequitur. The film unravels across the screen not like the graceful steps and movements of a Kurosawa film, but much like a hippo in a tutu who has had one too many cups of sake. 
If you're in the mood to see a touching movie about an unlikely relationship between a hurt child and a hardened adult, and if you want to keep your hope in Japanese cinema alive, don't watch Kikujiro.
