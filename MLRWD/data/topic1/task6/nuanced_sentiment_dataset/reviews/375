I saw this in my early twenties in the mid 90's and though i see myself or saw myself in the macho male role, I was not only mesmurised by the flim but in tears at the end, and in other parts of the flim.  I recenlty bought this flim on vhs from ebay, i belive that it like most classics these becoming rare to find.  What moved me was the story completely, the idea is that you will find the one person whom will love you for all eternity and no barrier of time or death will stop this, again the preocupation with life and death lies at the back of the flim, though ultimlty its a tale of eduring and eternal love which we all look for..The ending was dramtic at cape cod done with great gusto and i like that the shots around new york are made to look like a canvas. Also for a  flop at box office its still won at the oscars, though now its reconised as a classic of its kind....I would hope that eben adams would find jennie all through his life and the flim echos this stentiment...in all the flim is a wonderful and romantic love story with a supernaturel flavor which with a haunting score by debussy echo's through me every time a watch the flim. I will try to find this on dvd but its very difficult to find..
