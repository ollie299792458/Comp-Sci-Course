Ever wonder and question religion?  Question the New Testament and its many conflicts and holes?  Shake your head at the ludicrous comments and statements from the religious?  How about question the actions of muslims, catholics, mormons, etc?  Even if you never have you should still watch Maher's documentary.  Maher touches on all the subjects I have wondered about, the debates I've had with other religious people.  Maher talks about them and so much more.

Among some of the highlights are the comparisons between Jesus with Mithra and Horus and so on, showing the copycat nature of religions through the ages in order to gain credence and acceptance, gain a wider following.  Virgin Birth?  Nothing new there.  Resurrection three days after execution?  Already taken.  The documentary is checkered with these comparisons and they are well executed and supported.

What really made this documentary humorous was the little comments by the religious men.  Such as the muslim in a mosque talking about respect for women and their equality with men.  His point?  Look at the respect we have, we have a little corner over there where women can come and pray.  Or the hispanic man who claims to be the second coming of Jesus.  Not christ take two, according to him, but a descendant of Jesus.  Who, by the way, says that he is the first christian.

Additionally, most of the interviews are of people who have strong beliefs, and incidentally sound crazy.  But Maher has a fantastic interview with a Vatican Priest and a Vatican Astronomer, who were very insightful and how religion should be, rather than what it is.  Acceptance that the Bible is not fact but a moral guide.  Definitely recommend to everyone.

5 stars.
