This movie tries a new cause/affect, and location for the zombie genre as we are taken deep into the forest to escape from humans turned into zombies by tree sap from genetically modified trees. While it tries a new approach, it still includes most of the typical elements (cliche's) of the zombie genre. These north woods zombies are the slow, lumbering variety. You see, they are lumbering because it's a logging camp and lumber mill and, oh never mind. The action is filmed in the shaky, brittle 45 degree shutter look of "28 Days Later". It also includes the obligatory social/political messages; environmentalism, corporate greed, playing god, sadism, betrayal, love and redemption...too much for a zombie movie like this. The shaky cam quick edits were very distracting and could cause an epileptic seizure. The isolation and scenery are nice, but that is really all that this film adds to the genre, as we are still stuck with irrational, stupid behavior and plot holes. In a logging camp full of axes and 4 ft. chainsaws, these slow moving zombies should end up painting the forest red in short order, but nobody chooses to arm themselves and get aggressive. There must be at least one set of bolt cutters to cut the lock on the main gate so they can make their escape, but apparently not. The virus is instantly contracted through a bite, but people can be covered with blood with no ill affect.

While this film is far from a classic, and doesn't really build any tension or big scares, it is at least watchable, when the cameraman isn't spazzing out. I have seen so many horrible "horror" movies lately that I will grade on a curve and give this 2 1/2 stars.
