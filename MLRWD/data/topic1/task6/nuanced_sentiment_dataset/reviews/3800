Gustavo Dudamel - or, as I prefer to call him after watching this concert, Mr Exaggeration - has been hailed as yet another wunderkind of classical music conductors, together with such diverse figures as Daniel Harding and Christian Thielemann. Some people assume that classical music needs such wunderkinds - for instance, young charming guys that like to show off - in order to survive in the contemporary globalized world of kitsch and bad taste. This DVD inaugural LA Philharmonic concert is surely a welcome release for those sceptics.

But when I watched it, I was rather horrified by Mr Exaggeration's behavior at the conductor's rostrum: he looked like some kind of a madman from The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (cf. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JMQG">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Restored Authorized Edition)</a>) or a scarecrow automaton: insane gestures and grotesque facial expressions. For reference (and antidote), check, e.g., Evgeni Mravinsky's sober conducting style on Youtube.

What about the music, then? Well, I suppose that John Adam's "City Noir" is the perfect work for Mr Exaggeration, since it is a very violent work of repeated exaggerations. But I am no fan of Adams or minimalism in general. So I have no real opinion here.

Mahler's first, however, is another case. Mr Exaggeration has already recorded the fifth (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UNMUFK">Mahler: Symphony No. 5</a>), an acceptable but not impressive interpretation. Things are worse here, however. Exaggerations rule - is it really an interpretation (that is, what we usually mean with "interpretation") and not just an attempt to show off? Check for instance the second movement, which is virtually torn to pieces by all these extreme exaggerations. Other releases from Mr Exaggeration and DG show that the young conductor also has a developed taste for "light music" (see, e.g., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013USZHG">Fiesta</a>) or easy showpieces. Perhaps this indicates what kind of conductor Mr Exaggeration actually is. I would not be surprised if he is going to conduct the Vienna New Year concerts in the future.

The LA audience is very pleased, however, apparently spellbound by all the wunderkind exaggerations (it is surely hard to resist that temptation, it's probably like being charmed by children's playing). But I wonder if classical music actually can survive if "overkill" is what "interpretation" should mean today.

Fortunately, we are not short of outstanding Mahler firsts. Walter (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002A7H">Mahler: Symphonies No. 1 & No. 2; Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen</a>), Kubelik (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004TQUC">Mahler: Symphony No. 1</a>), Ancerl (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IZPQ">Ancerl Gold Edition 6: Mahler Symphony no. 1/ Strauss - Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks</a>), Horenstein (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001PBD">Gustav Mahler: Symphony No. 1</a>)...  any of these will highlight the severe shortcomings of Dudamel's mutilated "interpretation".

I will try to forget that I ever watched this awful concert.
