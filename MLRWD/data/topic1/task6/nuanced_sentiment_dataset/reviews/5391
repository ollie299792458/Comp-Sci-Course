Somehow Miramax has a knack for making great movies and then forgetting to market them.  Things to do in Denver When You're Dead ("Things to Do...")is exactly that.  While most movie studios go to great lengths to hype up their mobster movies (e.g. scarface and goodfellas), "Things to Do..." has mainly gained popularity by word-of-mouth.

The story tells of a reformed gangster, Jimmy the Saint (Andy Garcia) who is forced by the boss (Christopher Walken) to return to the life for a one-time operation.  Afterwards, Jimmy is forced to deal with the consequences.

Andy Garcia and Christopher Walken deliver terrific performances.  Walken's erratic line delivery and Garcia's suave play out perfectly with their respective characters.

The only reason I'm not giving this DVD 5 stars is because the DVD itself has no bonus materials:  no deleted scenes or director's commentary.  Nor is there an outtakes or artboard.

None the less, "Things to do..." is one of the best gangster movies ever - on par with Goodfellas and Scarface.  You'll be quoting lines from this movie soon after you watch it, and you'll be wishing more people had seen the movie.
