Well, the First Season of "I Love Lucy" is finally here on DVD. This is the newest edition for sale, and has 35 episodes (plus the pilot -- bringing it to 36 episodes) on just 7 discs. These are the original episodes of this classic series, filmed in 1951 and 1952. Though they are over 50 years old, the quality is just beautiful. There is no colorized version of the episodes, but it would just destroy the whole classic.

These episodes are the first few episodes of the series, and set the pace for the whole of the series. Its worth all you pay - since in the 1950s, seasons were almost 40 episodes long each (even though the seasons became shorter in this show towards the end of the run of the show.)

Uncut Episodes - I never knew how much syndication butchers these priceless classics. The DVD edition has mentions of sponsers, cut scenes, many not seen since the 1950s.

13 Episodes from "MY FAVORITE HUSBAND" - The DVD even has 13, full, uncut episodes from Lucy's radio show, which became the inspiration for several I Love Lucy episodes. These haven't been heard since the late 1940s.

Flubs - Bloopers and interesting tidbits.

Original Openings - Unseen since the 1950s - the DVD has the two Season 1 openings used.

Overall, a 5/5. 5 stars. I would get this if you're an I Love Lucy fan. Hopefully, the other seasons will come out, and we can see "The Lucy Show" on season by season DVD, since its first season also ruled.

I LOVE LUCY! :)
