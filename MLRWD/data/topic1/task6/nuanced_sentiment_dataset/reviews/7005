Here is a movie that I have actually been looking forward to. I guess this is another example of what will make you laugh will make you cry. 
From the movie trailer and the godsmack theme song " I stand alone" I was sold on this movie which after seeing proved to be a big disappointment. 
To begin with the story is very weak and throughout the movie it remains very shallow. The scenes are choppy and bounce from one action scene to the next action scene with fluff filler scenes and poor comic relief thrown in. 
The original storyline had a prophecy in place explaining how the rock becomes the scorpion king, but for some stupid reason all the scenes were removed from the final version of the movie and placed in the deleted scenes on the dvd. 
The action scenes are OK (not great), but in the background guitar music is being played which comes off as very cheesy. All the one liners are basically boilerplate and have been said in a million other movies. 
The bad guy, Memnon, is like 140 pounds and doesn't come off very threatening. 
Ariad, the comic relief, isn't very funny and once again is very generic. 
I do support The Rocks acting career and think he would do better in a bigger budget movie and in some sort of crime drama action role.
