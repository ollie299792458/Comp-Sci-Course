Well, let's no talk about the movie, everybody has seen this movie so it has no point at all... it'll be helpful talk about the blu ray edition. The fact is this blu ray has just 3 languages (english, spanish and french), the good news are they are in 5.1, so sound is very good in all laguages availables. About video quality, if you are not a hi-def geek it will be fine, i mean, it is not "superb" just fine, there are still some dark scenes where you can see not so good quality.
About extras, well, i am not an extras-boy but for persons who does, it has enough extras to keep your mind busy for a while: Introduction by the governator itself, commentaries from director, hbo documentary, sgt candy scene (is a scene where is supposed they get the model for the terminator 800, thanks god they didn't put in the movie), bloopers (some are funny), gallery, dressing documentary, trailers, video game trailers, etc.
It will be a nice addition to your sci-fi action movies in blu ray, this was the reason i bought it.
