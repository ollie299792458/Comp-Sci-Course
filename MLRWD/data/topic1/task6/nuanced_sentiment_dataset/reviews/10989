I own and cherish all the Family Guy volumes that have been released so far and this set is my least favorite, unfortunately.  I found several flaws:

- The fact that there are only 13 episodes included in this set should not really come as a surprise to anyone as this has been the procedure for the last couple of volumes. Still, for this amount I believe the price should be lower.
- As far as the content goes, I miss the dynamic of the dysfunctional but lovable Griffin family. In Volume 7, too much emphasis is put on one-liners and Brian's story lines in particular. There is not much of a plot in any of the episodes here. If you were to compare a random episode out of this volume to one of the older ones, you would surely notice a decline in quality and character development.
- To go off on what previous reviewers have already pointed out, Family Guy has crossed the line of decency by now.  Many of their jokes are offensive and demeaning even for someone with an open sense of humor, such as myself.  I also did not appreciate the abundant drug references because it is sending an inappropriate message.
- Finally, I am not fond of the new packaging. It's cheap and uninspired and I much prefer the way the previous volumes look in my bookshelf.

Although I do still enjoy watching the show, I am disappointed with the obvious decline in quality overall.
