"Nosteratu" was an unauthorized adaption of Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula" made by a German film company in 1922. The company couldn't get the rights to the novel so they just changed a few things (like the charaters' names) and did it anyway. They were successfully sued by Bram Stoker's widow, and all copies of the film were ordered destroyed. Fortunately some still remained, and now can be enjoyed by everyone.

Okay so this may be a silent film, but boy was it scary; it was very very well made. Count Orlock is very scary, and the director did a great job at setting a very eerie mood. I don't like silent films, but I was curious about this one and checked it out from my local library. The next day, I knew I had to have it. Unfortunately I bought a different version which was heavily edited, had a crappy picture, the names of the charaters were change to fit the names of the charators in Bram Stoker's novel, and the music was totally different and crappy too. It cost me $20.00 and the video store wouldn't allow me to return it. Then I bought the good version from Amazon and it only cost me $7.00. You want the good version by King Video which is unedited, has a great picture, has the original charaters' names, and has two great musical scores in it. That's the one you want. It's by King Video.

In all, it was a great and scary movie which I highly recommend!
