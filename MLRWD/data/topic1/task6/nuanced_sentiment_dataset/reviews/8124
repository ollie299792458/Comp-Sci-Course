Its seems theres a love/hate relationship whith this film, people love it or hate it, with a few so so opinions. I think the nostalgia factor helps a lot on the good reviews, such as my case.  
I saw Krull in my local cinema when I was 8 years old (I am 28 now) and I was in total awe. The cyclop, the flying horses, the black fortress, I mean, it was the kind of movie adventure that I loved and cheered. Been a child I absorbed the story and mythos the movie told, I remember been "afraid" of the menace of the fortress, thinking "they still got the guts to go there???" the Slayers were dreadful, the glavie was enigmatic and so on, I also recall making draws of the characthers and scenes from the movie and of course "singing to myself" the music, ah yes, the music, what a incredible portrait of the sense of magic,adventure and joy (got my two cds soundtrack a few months ago, fully recommend it.)
I saw the movie twice on the cinema, still remember that night that I took my parents to see it with me (first time was with friends and a adult of course) ah, those days... 
Anyway, back to the review. After all this years I still got fond memories from this one. Krull is a excellent example of the hero's journey, full of adventure and great moments.The DVD have a lot of cool features that any fan would love, so go ahead rent or buy it. If you never see it give a try. Despite been a bit cheesy by today standards, Krull packs a ride full of wonderful landscapes, action, great music, still somehow cool effects, and mainly a clasic sense of adventure that few recent films can achieve.
How I would love to see a special edition on the silver screen again, *sigh*
