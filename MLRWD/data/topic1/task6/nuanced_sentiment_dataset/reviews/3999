My problem with this is in both the performance and the filming. I can understand that The Stones have played some of these songs to death, But when they just slop through the parts, ignoring the original precision of how they put they notes together to create such great songs, its just disappointing. If you hear a performance of Beethoven's 9th Symphony where the musicians just having fun "estimating" the original written parts, it would suck. As much as I hate to say it, I'd rather listen a sound-alike Stones copy band who still respects the original music play these songs than the Stones themselves.
  And the audience? Where the long hair freaks? Is this really the Stones audience? A bunch of hot young girls and stock broker types in the front rows? I guess they either got invited by Scorsese because they'd look good on film or were rich enough to get tickets from the scalpers
  Watch the Altamont perfommance or RnR Circus, C***Sucker Blues to see these tired old impostors when they were THE STONES!!!...and an audience that was into the music, not into looking cool,
  But that said they'es still pretty good. Unfortunately they have their own legend to live up to and that's probably impossible to achieve.
  Keith did seem like he was trying on "You Got The Silver" and "Connection"
