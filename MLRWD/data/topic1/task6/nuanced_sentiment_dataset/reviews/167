While I was watching the recent Frost/Nixon movie, based on the stage play, it only made me yearn to see, once again, the original 1977 interviews. So I googled "frost nixon amazon" and found this 2 DVD set. I ordered it immediately and when it arrived I stayed up most of two nights watching it.
The first Watergate interview is simply riveting. Although many of us despised Nixon in the early 1970s now, in comparison with George Bush, he looks more like JFK. Frost's hand and finger movements during the interview are almost astonishing in their ability to allow him to ask very threatening questions while his body language is warm and serene. Watching Nixon, with his wonderful deep and originally confident voice, gradually disintegrate is nothing short of spellbinding.
A book "The Conviction of Richard Nixon" by James Reston Jr describes how he (Reston) did most of the research that allowed Frost to spring questions that really took Nixon by surprise and I would recommend that book to anyone who has an interest in what went on in that Nixon-Watergate-tapes era. For me, the fact that I had read that book before watching these DVDs, helped me to appreciate the brilliance of Reston's research and the also the brilliant way that Frost put his questions across. Real life is more thrilling than a movie.
