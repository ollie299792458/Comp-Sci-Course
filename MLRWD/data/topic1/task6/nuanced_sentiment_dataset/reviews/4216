I went into watching this film knowing from the start that the film-and the real lfe story behind it were mundane, but the whole point I believe is the injustice of the missing wife and her probable murderer never being charged with the real crime. I decided to watch because I have always wondered about homicide of a spouse, and wanted to see if the story shows their codependency. The answer is no, for the wife, (played by Dunst) seems intelligent but passive, -she aborts her child because that is her husbands wish--she decides not to divorce despite being beaten and abused--because she is used to living on his money and income. How many times in the real story did he beat on her, and she still comes back to her abuser? When he does an especially despicable act, she confronts him...somehow that does not seem like the wisest choice of action.
Although I sympathize with her, and the film obviously does, she brings on her own fate, after living with him for years, by ignoring the warning signs.
