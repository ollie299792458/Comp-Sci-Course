I have to agree with some of the reviewers expressing disappointment in this movie, or at least empathize with them partially.  In its whole, it's not the mindblower its awards would have you believe.  However, it is  nonetheless a wonderful film.  It gives remarkable, rare glimpses into  human nature and police politics, and the story itself is fantastic; full  of twists, turns and thrills.  Kevin Spacey is, as usual, spectacular, and  if anything, I think his is the only underrated performance in the film  (though by no means are the others under par).  Jim LaRegina's comments  below are pretty much bang-on for me: I thought the Ed/Lynn scene was the  start of the film's minor deterioration; up until that point, the movie was  astonishingly brilliant.  After that, however, there are definitely too  many plot holes.  I haven't read the book, so I don't know if it could have  to do with the alterations done for the movie adaptation, but in any case,  you can smell Hollywood all over the last half-hour or so.  Anyway, this is  a wonderful film, not 5-star but 4, that deserves multiple viewings and a  good chunk, if not all, the laudatory comments it's received.
