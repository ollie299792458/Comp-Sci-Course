I have a bad habit of assuming that if big name actors come together to make a movie that it will be a fresh idea that I haven't seen before.  My last mistake was "The Expendables".  It's just another big paycheck for actors leaving the audience with a movie we've all seen before.

The movie starts out very promising.  The kids win a game, and they have a good inspiring coach.  Then the coach dies, and everything, including his death, is just one big joke.  Sandler can't even get through the eulogy without making jokes. The rest of the movie is them having a good time making about a million one liners, completely disregarding the death of their coach.  Who cares, right?  We have jokes to tell.

I also can't help but notice that lately Adam Sandler needs to be the man in all his movies.  He's always filthy rich, the overachiever, the alpha male.  Did he really need to wear that Harvard shirt?  We get it, Adam, you're the man.  I really hope he goes back to his "Punch Drunk Love/Reign Over Me" days and starts to play a real person again.

If this was a cheesy family movie, that would be one thing.  But the jokes are too mature for that.  So they really expected grown adults to laugh at this stuff?  It makes me wonder about the future of comedies.

I've learned a lesson though.  If there are five or more big names in a movie, it's probably crap.  Exceptions include animated films like Toy Story 3. And if Bruce Willis is in it, it's garbage.  No, I'm not talking about Pulp Fiction.  Those glory days are apparently over.
