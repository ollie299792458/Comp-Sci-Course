At 80 minutes long, this has got to be the shortest movie not actually called a short film I have ever seen. I found myself wishing for a bit more (or any) backstory. We find Wendy and Lucy in a park in a nameless town in Oregon. We soon find out that Wendy is from Indiana and is on her way to Alaska in hopes of finding a job. She and Lucy are living out of her car, an old honda accord, and are on an extremely tight budget. Wendy has just a few hundred dollars to her name, and it is going fast. Things go from bad to worse very quickly, and worst of all, Lucy goes missing. The bulk of the movie deals with Wendy trying to get things back on track and find her dog, who she clearly loves.
 This is a very understated movie to say the least. There is virtually no soundtrack, unless you call Wendy's humming to herself a soundtrack. It feels almost like a documentary, I think director Reichardt was going for simplicity and realism over sentimentality, maybe too much so. It is beautifully shot, however, and has a few moments that go by quickly but are worth appreciating. This is obviously not a high-budget movie where things explode and gorgeous people say carefully scripted things. It is a very simple tale of a young woman on the fringe of society, someone you might well ignore or fail to notice if you encountered them in real life. Michelle Williams gives a fine performance as Wendy, and though Reichardt seems to almost deliberately avoid trying to make you care about what happens to her and Lucy, you may just find that, by the end of the film, you do.
