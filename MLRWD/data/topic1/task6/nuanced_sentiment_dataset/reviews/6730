This movie is perfectly fine for Children , I watched this movie before and it does not look like Disney was giving Glory to the Cruel Treatment of animals here but rather it was the other way around &gt; Like when the Ring Master had all those Elephant's standing on top of eachother I don't think Walt Disney was saying it's okay to treat animals this way, I mean did you ever think that it could have only been a joke, its just a cartoon not everything they do needs to be taken serious , also I get the feeling that Walk Disney was against this treatment of animals , like when they locked up Dumbo's Mother it seems like Disney was saying this was a bad thing , to me I think that maybe Disney was trying to say that some of this stuff that goes on in the circus is not good and is cruel &gt; I mean that is the message I get out of  it &gt; I am someone who loves and adores animals so I can understand how manby an animal lover might would be offened , but to me this movie makes animal cruelity out to be bad if anything &gt; No this movie is not racist , just because they have Black people putting up the tent does not make it racist and just because the Black Crows might talk like Black people, I mean it's getting crazy people thinking of almost anything as being racist , like having Black Witches is Racist is just crazy and also if you say that Black Man rather then that Man someone might accuse you of being racist, I mean people really need to take it easy , this stuff is not racist &gt; It just that way it was back then and it not Walk Disney's fault that it was that way back then, so just because they had those Black Men putting up Tents does not make Disney a racist lol , maybe if anything Disney here as well was speaking against racism ? Also so what if the Black Crows sounded like Black People that does not make Disney a racist lol , I mean did not the Black Crows turn out to be good and help Dumbo ? hmmmmmm ? Well then so if they where supposed to be like Black People then Disney was making these certain Black People out to be good and helpful, so if anything Disney was saying that there are a lot of good Black People &gt; Anyways, I have always liked this movie as a Child but never owned it until it this Special Dvd came out &gt; I like the message about this baby Elephant with a so called birth defect being good and coming out a winner , just because he was different other did not like him, even though he was so innocent , to me this movie has wonderful messages and I don't see that this movie gives Glory to racism or cruel animal treatment at all &gt;
