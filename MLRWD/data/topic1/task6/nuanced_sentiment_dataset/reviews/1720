This movie is extremely historicly accurate, all the way down to the American servicemens' harsh, coarse language.
I love to study World War II, and am considered by many to be a amatuer historian, though one thing I always have trouble with is the extremely foul talk of the American soldiers. A good soldier should be able to speak his mind without spewing unwholesome words.
In the entire movie, I dared not count the number of cuss words spoken by the Americans, though, on the other end is the fact that throughout the entire movie, only ONE swear word was spoken by a Japanese soldier.
Other than the exessive swearing, it is a highly entertaining movie, with fast paced dogfights and slower times when top officers try to determine where the enemy is going to strike and where to feint his own ships. Their is also a smaller story being devoloped in that Charlton Heston's character's son falls in love with a Japanese-American woman, and the FBI arrest her on the charge of being a spy. Overall, this is a well done movie with the usual down-falls of exessive dirty talk. If you have a swear-word censor, this would be a good movie to get, but keep in mind that it will only work on dvds, as the videos do not have subtitles for the censor to read.
