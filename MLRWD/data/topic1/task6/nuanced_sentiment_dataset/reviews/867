If you are an Anglophile/period piece addict, you will enjoy this movie despite its flaws.  If your significant other isn't into this sort of thing, then tuck him/her in and settle down by yourself to be entertained.  The uninitiated will not be happy sitting through this one, as you have to have some knowledge of the social and political scene of the Napolionic era to make any sense out of the plot (e.g. Why are they bashing Lord Nelson over their lobster dinners?)
  First, the bad news:  The main problem with this film is that someone  tried to make it at all.  The complex characters and twists and turns of plot from the Thackery book just shouldn't have been condensed into a movie. And the director's well-intentioned theme of anti-colonialism was communicated in confusing bursts.  If you LOVE the book, skip this one.
  Now for the good news:  James Purefoy's performance is worth the price of admission.  In his role as Rawdon Crawley, he combines punk rock bad boy (it's the hair-do) with English Prince Charming and steals the show.  I may make my own documentary film entitled "What Women Want" and use excerpts from this movie to illustrate my points.  For example, "How to Act When Your Your Wife Tells You She's Pregnant" (Nooo, not "Oh, Sh-t")  Watch and learn from James Purefoy as Rawdon Crowley : "Oh, you brilliant clever girl!  I LOVE you (deep kiss).  Yes, the genre for this movie may very well be "female fantasy".
