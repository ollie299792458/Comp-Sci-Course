I was expecting a superficial comedy about a Hispanic woman in an Anglo household.  The reality is much funnier, soul-searching, and beatiful than that.

Adam Sandler was decent in this.  It was beyond his normal range and I thought he handled it quite well.  Cloris Leachman was hilarious as Evelyn.  The little girl who played Cristina was excellent.  Tea Leoni was, quite possibly, the most annoying character in history.  The two people who stole this show were Sandler's daughter Bernie and Flor.  These two female actresses were phenomenal and created all of the emotion of this movie.

In my heart, I wanted John and Flor to end up together.  I wanted John to dump "Mrs. Clasky" and end up happily with someone he loved and who loved him.  But I also knew that Flor would never want to break up a marriage and that John loved his daughter too much to leave his wife.  It was a heart-wrenching ending, but I thought it stayed true to the characters.

I would give "Spanglish" 5 stars, but Tea Leoni's character was so annoying that I just had to dock it one star! :)

I highly recommend this film.
