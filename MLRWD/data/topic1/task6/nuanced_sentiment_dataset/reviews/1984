It mystifies me that so many here are rating these two miniseries ("Tinker" and "Smiley's People") five stars.  Many years ago, I noticed them on PBS, and found them to be exceptionally slow-moving, numbingly cerebral and complex, bland, and ultimately disappointing. I don't need an explosion or car-chase every five minutes, but this was a meager meal, indeed.  As a matter of fact, I have come to view their type as a kind of touchstone of the mediocre in the spy genre.

I will admit that reading the book versions beforehand (and riveting one's eyes to the screen) might have made a difference in my appreciation of these, but I was little impressed "back when," and don't think I'll invest any money in thrashing through the underbrush of the same old territory again.  And, there is so much better fare abroad, such as the "Bourne" series, "Salt,"....."Ronin," "The Good Shepherd,'..."The Manchurian Candidate" (both versions),..."The Recruit,"..."Spy Game,"..."Breach"..."Mission Impossible" (and some of the Bond pictures, such as "Quantum of Solace")...."Four Days of the Condor".."The Package"..."The Spy Who Came in from the Cold," "The Mechanic"...and the current TV series, "Homeland." These are like a full-course meal, compared to the water and hard-tack of the Alec Guinness vehicles, which are also a fine remedy for insomnia.
