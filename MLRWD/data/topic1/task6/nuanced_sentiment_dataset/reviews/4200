I wanted to like Memoirs of a Geisha going in to the movie.  I had listened to most of the audio version, and was looking forward to the visual depiction of the story, a story which I found quite compelling in its simplicity.  The first concern that I had upon viewing the movie was that moviegoers who had not listened to the audiocassette or read the novel would have been somewhat confused by the chain of events. The movie starts out with the girls being pulled away from their home, and only briefly do we see a man standing at the train station watching them leave. In the novel and in the audio version, it was clear that Mr. Tanaka (spelling?) had made financial arrangements with the girls' father to have the sisters brought to the city because he had seen nine-year-old Chiyo in the small fishing village and been intrigued by her beautiful blue-gray eyes, thinking that she could be an enchanting geisha when she matured.  This is not made clear in the movie.  Other than that, it appears to follow the plot fairly well.  The movie is visually captivating but also very dark at times (perhaps because the geishas spend so much time inside and go out to teahouses at night only).The movie, however, does not stir any lasting emotion or impression. It is a sad story with little joy, and only the last few moments (and here the setting is bright and alive and stunningly beautiful) of the movie suggest that Sayuri (the grown up Chiyo) will have any pleasure in her life.  The movie does drag on at points.  All in all, a good movie, but you may wonder as I and my friends did why we opted for this movie instead of another movie that was playing at the same time.  Still, it's well worth renting when it comes out on DVD.  Not much will be lost in the viewing.
