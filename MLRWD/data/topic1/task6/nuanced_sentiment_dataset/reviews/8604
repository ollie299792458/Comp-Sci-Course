This is NOT a "ballet" workout.  Anyone who has taken even one ballet class knows that the work at the barre is the foundation of everything -- the barre is the source of the dancer's strength, flexibility, beautiful posture, grace.  THERE IS NO BARRE WORK in this so-called "ballet" workout.  Hence, you cannot rely on this DVD to help you achieve the dancer's posture, strength, and balance.

For example: this DVD includes SIT UPS.  No ballet teacher would EVER have dancers do sit ups -- though dancers have the strongest abdominals of any athletes.  Those strong abdominals derive from the work of  standing on one leg while extending the other leg, keeping both hips and shoulders perfectly level --  this work requires a very tight midsection.  In fact, these exercises -- always starting at the barre -- will produce a far flatter stomach than situps could ever achieve, partly because the traditional barre exercises are done while STANDING to train the dancer to hold her stomach flat, her ribcage high, and her spine long while she is standing, walking, and dancing.  Sit ups, performed flat on your back, do nothing to improve posture or grace of movement.

You could do this workout all day, every day, and you will never achieve a dancer's body because this routine lacks the fundamental work that is the foundation of the dancer's body.

Worst of all, this product doesn't even function as a DVD ought to: you can't skip back and forth between sections.  A total ripoff.

Could someone please direct me to a REAL ballet video?
