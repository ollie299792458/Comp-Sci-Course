Actually, it is really 3 and one-half stars for a rating. . .

I was not aware of the movie until I picked up a recent copy of "Guns of the Old West," a periodical put out by Harris Publications.  In it was an article about the guns used in "Appaloosa."  That got my interest going.

Comparing the movie to the book is a little difficult for me, even though most of the book was transferred into the movie.  I understand, as the director, co-producer, co-writer Ed Harris easily choose who he wanted for what parts and while I'm not complaining about most parts, I just didn't think Rene Zellwegger was right for the part, as it was written anyway.  The character needed to be fleshed out more (literally and figuratively) to better fit the Book to movie transformation.  Yes, I understand it was shot with a limited budget, but it was a weak point.  Some have stated why they couldn't understand her even being a part of it; well it's simple.  She throws the monkey wrench into the "keep focused on the job at hand" that Virgil and Everett had been doing for years.  Love can be like that!

The relationship between the lead male characters is a bit similar to Gus and Woodrow in Lonesome Dove, most notable when Everett is grabbing Virgil off the Teamster.

I bought the movie, in all honesty, because of the article in the gun magazine, and the interest in the 8-gauge.  Sometimes, it's better to have a movie in your "personal library" than to go off to the rental store, or library, and get it.
