I was excited to recieve my copy of Storytelling because i am a recent fan of Todd Solondz and wanted to get my hands on some of his more recent work.  Having just recently watched Happiness and Welcome to the Dollhouse i really expected more from this movie.  Reading other reviews i see people complaining about fiction but i thought it was the better of the two stories.  I mainly feel this way because nonfiction couldnt have moved any slower or been more boring.  Not even John Goodman and Paul Giamatti could save this story.  I dont mind slow stories if there is more going on than whats just on the screen but there wasnt with this tale and aside from the little corks thrown in that seemed out of place the story of a loser kid with no ambition being presured to go to college by his rich parents has been told many times better already so why bother telling it again if you dont have anything to add?  I cant imagine that nonfiction was actually based on any real events and if it was then he should have told it better because it creeped along at such a snails pace that i barely made it through it.  Fiction was the better story imo mainly because it moved at a better pace and the acting was much better.  Selma Blair and Leo Fitzpatrick were great were as the kids in nonfiction stumbled over almost all of thier lines.  I also found fiction to be more realistic than nonfiction which may have been the point of the two stories with contradicting titles.  At any rate, if your new to Todd Solondz's work check out dollhouse or happiness as they are much better films.  I have not seen Palindromes yet but hopefully its more on par with his earlier work.
