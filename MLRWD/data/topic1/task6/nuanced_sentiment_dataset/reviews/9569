Hollywood did it again.  This movie could have been so much better.  "Based on The Illiad" simply means that they used the same names as some of the characters and locations. When is Hollywood going to realize that saying "based on" does not grant a blanket license to rewrite the entire story?  The Illiad stands on it's own merits as a masterpiece.  Why obliterate it?  I'm not talking "time constraint" editing here folks.  The story was mutilated.

As much as I like Brad Pitt in other movies, this definitely was a poor choice for Achilles.  His dialog is not convincing at all.  As a matter of fact, this very element ruined the movie for me. In contrast, Peter O'Toole, Eric Bana and Sean Bean were wonderful.

The effects, cinematography and choreography were adequately done in my opinion.  More "fluff" in nature but not distracting.  I didn't notice the length of the movie as a problem.  As negative as my review sounds, I honestly believe that there will be a few people that like it for atleast one viewing.  "Renting" is a fair recommendation.
