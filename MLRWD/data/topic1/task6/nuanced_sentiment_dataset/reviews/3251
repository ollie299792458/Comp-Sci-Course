I actually enjoyed the film even though I did not find it to be factual about the dates the author was using for the birth of Jesus.  I did contact him regarding the descrepancies but he clung to his very loose determinations.  I found the astrological parts to be quite fascinating.  I enjoyed it but would not recommend it to anyone without letting them know about the date descrepancy.

It isn't hard to research the date of the birth of Jesus it is very well documented in History.  It was the Emperor Constantine that choose the date of the Winter Solstice for the birthdate of Jesus.  Constantine just switched the birthdate of Tamuz the son of the Sun God that the pagans had been celebrating for centuries to the birthdate of the Son of the Creator of the Universe who was actually born during the Feast of Trumpets somewhere between September and October.  There are other historical facts that also prove the time of the birth of Jesus but he wasn't interested in hearing about them either.
