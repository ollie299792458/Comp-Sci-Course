Maybe I'm getting older and becoming set in my ways. I'm a huge fan of the horror movies from the 1970's and 1980's. Those movies just seemed like they put forth more effort in trying to scare or gross out the audience. I recently read one review that says this movie takes us back to the days of the horror movies from the late 70's and early 80's. I guess the setting being a cabin in the woods, a la "Evil Dead" or 5 teenagers a la every horror movie during that time could be considered the same but the movie iself isn't even close!! Being a huge fan of the genre I'll give any horror movie a chance, but it just seems to me these newer horror films fall short of some of the classics. There have been some really great recent horror movies like "The Ring", "Wrong Turn", or "28 Days Later"  but let's get to "Cabin Fever".
A group of college friends are trapped in the woods and methodically killed off by a horrifying flesh-eating virus. 
It's hard to hit on any good points involved in this film. I never expect a great plot or any kind of decent acting in a horror flick but I could've starred in this film and it wouldn't have made a difference. The characters were terrible, the story was not intriguing at all and falls flat on it's face and the killing scenes are boring at best; and what is the point of that annoying, biting, pancake yelling, karate kid wannabe. As a matter of fact the best part of this movie (besides the ending credits, because at that point mercifully it's over) is cenetered around the shotgun in the country store in the early going and at the end of the movie. Really has nothing to do with the movie itself which is probably why I liked it. 
I'm sure there are people who like or even love this film but it didn't do a whole lot for me. If your an avid horror fan you may,if your really bored, wanna check this one out but I wouldn't expect too much. 1 1/2 stars at best
