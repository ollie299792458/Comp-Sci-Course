The four Robert Urich full length movies published after the "Spenser For Hire" tv series went off the air were of varying value.

The first two "Ceremony" and "Pale Kings & Princes" being set in Boston, were more enjoyable than the final two "Judas Goat" and "A Savage Place" which were obviously filmed in Canada.

I would still like to see the original 66 "Spenser For Hire" tv shows published as a DVD set, however, that doesn't seem too likely in the near future.  I'd also like to see the 13 "A Man Called Hawk" tv shows in DVD format!

Even the Joe Mantegna videos originally published on VHSs, "Small Vices," "Thin Air," and "Walking Shadow" should be made into DVDs.

Mantegna was a "better fit" for the Spenser character, even by Robert B. Parker's standards than Robert Urich!

Since Mantegna now does the audio tapes of most of Parker's Spenser books, it would only seem logical that he should continue the series of recent books beyond the three VHSs he originally made, and these should be available in DVD format.

I'm sure many would purchase reasonably priced DVDs or DVD sets.
