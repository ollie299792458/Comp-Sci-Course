I don't know why this movie is so highly acclaimed in the world of Spaghetti Westerns ... it had it's moments,  but was overall a little flat. My father fell alseep within the first half hour of the film. Franco Nero is clearly an Eastwood look alike but delivers his lines with indifference. I like the concept and some of the story but I could do without the prostitues fighting in the mud and there was too much repetitious talk.
I feel this is one movie that would benefit from a flashback of DJango's life before - even minimally - it might have added depth to this indifferent character.
Also they never did resolve what happened to Maria - I assume she died.
The directing wasn't very interesting and i would hardly say this is one of the best non Leone Westerns - Death Rides a Horse is much much better.
While,  I like Franco Nero,  I am hoping his story is fleshed out more in the sequels. His line delivery was just awful.
I'm sorry i bought this dvd at the recommendation of the reviews posted here and from The Spaghetti Western Database and some books I read. Maybe I missed something and need to watch it again... I dunno,  something was missing.
I,however did like the ending and that last shot was beautifully framed.
