I bought this after several of my friends raved about it and, knowing my taste in movies, recommended it to me highly.

I shouldn't have believed the hype.

One of the other reviewers wrote that they didn't understand why Kate Hudson's character's story was told. I couldn't agree more. There wasn't a thing interesting about her. Oh, she's a pretty, perky hospice worker who wasn't there for the death of her father. Oh, the irony... *yawn*

Sure, it has a nice twist at the end, but 90% of it is pretty evident from the first 20  minutes of the movie. The other 10% is catchable if you pay attention through the movie rather than yawning and/or debating about turning it off.

I'd never heard of hoodoo before watching this movie and the bits I picked up from the movie interested me enough that I don't consider it a total flop.

It reminded me of The Sixth Sense a bit, if you take out the annoying kid and every ounce of novelty and interest that movie held.
