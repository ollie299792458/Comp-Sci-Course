I was eagerly awaiting the release of this DVD, as I missed the film when it played in IMAX theaters.  It boasted an impressive array of talent (including narration by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet and a score by Danny Elfman) and adoring reviews.  Unfortunately, this is one of those IMAX films that doesn't survive the transition to the small, 2-D screen.  Stripped of the 3-D effects and gigantic high-resolution image, it's deadly dull.

"Deep Sea" starts off strongly with a mysterious shot of ethereal jellyfish swimming in darkness.  Then the next shot is of a huge grouper floating almost motionlessly, and Depp brightly tells us that "he's always hungry!"  The film continues in that vein, with endless shots that were obviously staged for 3-D but appear oddly static and contrived on a television screen.  The narration is utterly inane; it vacillates between PBS-style pomposities (there's the obligatory stuff about how we're devastating the ocean ecosystem) and anthropomorphic nonsense that seems to be aimed at small children.  Depp manages to maintain his dignity, but Winslet comes off as condescending.  Elfman's classical work "Serenada Schizophrana" is somewhat awkwardly adapted into a score that is barely audible under the narration.

Despite the phrase "deep sea" in the title, most of the film seems to be taking place about 20 feet under water.  With the possible exception of a squid that changes color several times a second, there's nothing in this film that you haven't seen before.
