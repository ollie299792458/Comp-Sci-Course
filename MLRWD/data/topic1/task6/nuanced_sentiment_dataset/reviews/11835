this documentary series brings you the murder of president Kennedy from lots of deferent aspects, and lots of deferent theories.

through this series you can see what happened there on the 22.11.1963 at the Dealey Plaza.

they invoke from the shadows of the past all the voices, the scenes and the people.

the documentary is edited in a very interesting way.

this is an important piece of history, and i think it that it must be on the shelf of every house.

P.S

I will not start to write here if it was a conspiracy or not. though this documentary brings a review on the History, i have to write a review on the product. i will just say that this documentary, looks on the murder of JFK from lots of deferent point of view , and sometimes from lots of deferent decades.

i think this is the best documentry i had seen about the murder of Kennedy. and anyone whjo did not live at that time ( like me ) can have any cule of what happened there.
