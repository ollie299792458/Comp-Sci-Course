The acting, the direction, the sets, the casting...all awful! And in this case I believe awful is being kind. None of this story was remotely believable, and again whether you blame that on the acting, the script, the direction, the sets...I don't know. I normally don't write bad reviews simply because I usually have better things to do with my time, but in this case I hope that the people involved with the making of this film actually read some of these and are motivated to get better.

In what world would there be this ridiculously (former model) hot psych professor who is not a complete psycho interested in seducing her young students (Predatory, creepy uncle theme), and some former child star (creepy child theme) put together to make anything but a creepy unbelievable storyline? Really? What were we supposed to leave this film with?

There was no love, no seduction, no real...story. And I agree 100% with the other reviewer who commented on the cutting of the food scene...took an already creepy idea into realms one can find no words to describe.

Just awful, sadly like so many of these films are. If you want to watch a film that took real courage, had an amazing love story, and social message without being at all preachy watch Circumstance. It is amazing! And sadly in this genre all too rare.
