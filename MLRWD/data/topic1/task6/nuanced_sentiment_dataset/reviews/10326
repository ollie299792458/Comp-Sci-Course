This movie got a lot of bad reviews from all over the world. Naturally, I got curious to see how these skilled actresses (Diane Keaton also directed), and screenwriters could make such a bad movie - if it was as bad as the critics thought, that is. After seeing the movie I have mixed feelings for it. 
All cast members are quite good, especially the three female stars and Walter Matthau, as their senile father, Lou. It feels a little sad to see him, however. He looks so old and makes his bacon-eating character in "Grumpy Old men", from 1993 look like a healthy young man. But he makes a good performance in this movie, which became his last. Meg Ryan plays Eve, the middle sister who takes most care of their dad and visits him at the hospital, while her sisters focus on their careers. The oldest sister, Georgia (Keaton) is working more than ever on the fifth anniversary edition of her magazine, "Georgia", which she named after herself, and Maddy (Kudrow) is an actress in a soap opera. 
What this movie lacks the most is a strong plot. It focuses on the lives of the three sisters, mostly on Eve's. It has a number of flashback scenes that make the movie feel slightly confusing. The characters aren't interesting enough to compensate for the weak plot.
  This is a comedy, but compared to for example "When Harry Met Sally", written by Nora Ephron, who helped her sister, Delia, write the screenplay for this movie, it's quite humorless. There are few funny scenes. The lack of humor makes it feel more like a too lightweight drama. However, the movie does show that when one family member takes on too much responsibility, it often leads to conflict.
To sum up, Hanging Up is not a totally bad movie. However, it should be much funnier and more touching than it is. But it has some good acting performances, and whoever likes any of the actors or actresses should give it a try, they're all doing a good job.
