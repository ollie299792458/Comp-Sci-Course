I've watched both "Party Monster" as well as the documentary "Party Monster - The Shockumentary."  While I found both interesting I was primarily struck by how much people effort people have gone in order to tell the world how "fabulous" Michael Alig was in his heyday.  One gets the impression that the makers of both films, along with the individuals he once associated with, almost think that it was kind of cute that he murdered a friend, dismembered the body, and then jokingly bragged about doing it to people around him. 
In the documentary "Angel" is largely dismissed as a disposable individual, hardly worth missing. The only person who actually shed a tear for him being Angel's brother. I  really doubt that Angel's brother would have agreed to be interviewed for the documentary if he had known the way they were going to glorify Michael Alig while simultaneously portray his brother as a desperate drug dealing poseur.  
I think the film, rather than the documentary, was actually a bit more balanced.  Wilson Cruz,  Macaulay Culkin, and  Chloë Sevigny  were all incredible.  Their performances were unbelievably good.  Seth Green did OK, though all I could think about every time he came on screen was his appearance on Punk'd (for that matter all I could think of when  Dylan McDermott came on stage was Bobby Donnel).
Regardless of the agenda, the two films probably complement each other. If I had to watch one of them again I would see the film rather than the "shockumentary" if for no reason that the opportunity to see Chloë Sevigny again.  
I still think it is a bit scary when people justify a person's behavior by almost saying "well, he didn't really know what he was doing because he was on drugs. You can't really blame him because it was the drugs"
