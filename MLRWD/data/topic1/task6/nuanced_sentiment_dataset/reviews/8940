The last collaboration between Ferrell and McKay, Anchorman, was brilliant. It works because the conflicts between the characters are rooted in a specific context. While we may be glad the sexism and societal prejudices of the 70's are gone, the movie also makes clear that nostalgia is not a reason to appreciate the past. It's okay to move on. But most of all, the movie is just plain funny.

Then there was this movie. Maybe my expectations were high. Maybe I thought Will Ferrell, who is funny in almost anything, would make it tolerable. But, alas, I was disappointed.

Where Anchorman looked on the 70's with a certain sweetness, understanding that how people act is largely dependent on the situations in which they live, Talladega Nights mocks a whole culture and people in a pretentious and typical Hollywood-elitist manner. In Anchorman, the film makers truly liked the characters, as in American Pie. Bumbling and sexist is funny in this context. In Talladega Nights, the film-makers choose to make fun of them; even have contempt for them. That is not fun to watch; it's not even funny.

The only redeeming quality of this movie is the guy who plays Borat. Otherwise, a one-star rating would have been warranted.
