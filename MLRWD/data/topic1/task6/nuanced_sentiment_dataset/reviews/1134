I have always loved Audrey Hepburn ever since I first learned about her when I was about 9 or 10 years old.I have seen all of her movies,and this by far is her greatest one.As a matter of fact,I think this movie is the greatest of all time!Ok,ok,a little exaggerated,but it is my personal favorite of all time.Audrey Hepburn is simply amazing in this movie as ditzy but loveable hooker(yes,hooker) Holly Golightly,whom is one of the greatest movie characters in movie history,in my book.Audrey conatins so much charm in this movie and really is the best known Audrey Hepburn. movie.And George Burns has amazing charisma and chemistry with Audrey as aspiring writer Paul Zarjak,who Holly nicknames as her borther Fred since she thinks they have a resemblance.And the supporting cast is great,too,especially Mickey Rooney's hilarious part as Mr?,Holly's Asian naighbor,which some people might find offensive,but is still very funny.In fact,the whole movie is hilarious,one example being the side-splitting scene where Holly drinks herself under the table(no,not literally!).But,this isn't all laughs,some of this movie is so heartbreaking and tearjerking that you can't help but take out the Kleenex box,especially when Holly gets the message after going out with the Brazilian millionaire that her brother,Fred...(when you see the movie,you'll know what I'm talking about.)But,above all of this,the movie is so romantic that you'll wanna get married faster than you can say "Holly Golightly"!Sure,Holly&amp;Paul's relationship gets a few speed bumps along the way(Audrey dating a Brazilian millionaire),but over all of it,they triumph,making this movie one of the greatest,if not,the greatest romantic comedy of all time,and then some.And,the fact that Audrey's character,Holly,plays hard-to-get for such a long time makes this a serious comedy,and not just a big piece of fun.Although I could never figure out why Holly would want to date anyone that looks like her btother,but then I realize that true love is true love and nothing can break it,and it's all thanks to this masterpiece.Oh,and the little black dress,simply amazing(sorry,I just had to add that!)!
The Verdict:Like I Said,One Of The Greatest Movies In History Starring One Of The Greatest Actresses That Ever Lived.
