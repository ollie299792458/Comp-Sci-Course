I believe that there are 3 things to make a successful animation movie. good story, good characters and good laugh. and I LOVE the first Ice Age but I am not sure why they made this film. I did not this movie at all. I am shocked that so many people did. First off the story was...well there really was no story. They just kept walking around trying to find a boat. They would also forget about this many times and get side tracked with a the B plot witch was even more pointless. The B plot was a love story between 2 characters that really don't even talk to each other or get to know each other and yet we are surpost to buy the ending? Give me a break! Next is the characters, there was just far to many for me to care about. I also was shocked to find the charcaters were sort of mean and nasty. I found my self rooting for the flood. I missed just the 3 of them by themselves. Lastly a good laugh. The movies was not where not near as funny as the first one. The 3 main characters were also not as funny as the orginal one. In this movie you have a lot of negative humor. Also I found my self very confused with thie movie. In the first movie we saw the Ice age begin, If I am not mistaking the Ice age lasted 200 years. Wouldn't all those animals be dead by then?
