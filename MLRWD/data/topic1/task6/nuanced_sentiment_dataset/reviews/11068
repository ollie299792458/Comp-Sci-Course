Despite how hard it is to sit through NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD after all these years (some movies just get "old," same stay fresh forever, NIGHT's superior sequel DAWN OF THE DEAD being one of the latter), I still  would have appreciated a better DVD transfer. 
The interactive  "trivia" questions, what few there are, are too easy and focus on  just the plot, never challenging horror fans with behind-the-scenes and  production-related questions (this would have been far more interesting).  It also appears to me that the production team behind the NOTLD DVD didn't  put much effort into this transfer. The credit list lacks detail, and the  only biography they have is on Duane Jones (Ben). What happened to George  A. Romero?
Also, the quality of the film itself is unsatisfactory, fuzzy  at best. Maybe it's because my TV doesn't have that blasted S-Video  configuration (but I doubt it, as other DVDs in my collection are visually  stunning despite the lack of "S-Video"), but this print of NOTLD  did nothing to progress the quality that DVDs are suppost to bring to old  classics.
All in all, an unsatisfactory buy, but probably still worth  your time for the original film inside.
