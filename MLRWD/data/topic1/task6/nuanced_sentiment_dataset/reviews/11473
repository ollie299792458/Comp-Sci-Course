This 1925 silent film by Sergei Eisenstein is a masterpiece to say the least.  The film works around a series of five episodes. The most memorable episode is without question the protest of having to eat rotten meat. The way in which the camera revolves around the meat, the maggots, the faces are disturbing. Being a propaganda film, one cannot help but view this film with an emotional and stirring response. The plot and structure are rather simple, allowing easy understanding for the audience. This film needs to be in the category of art film, for there are countless memorable shots, angles, takes, and scenes that stay with the viewer. The film is shocking, to this day, which only highlights its worth when it was made in the early part of the 20th Century. Some memorable shots worth looking at again are the in-sync boots of the soldiers marching, the scary image of a baby falling down stairs, and the massive chaos on the ship with soldiers running about. These scenes work exceptionally well in Eisenstein's work in montage. I would recommend this film to any one, really. I think people who are interested in sci-fi and action films would really enjoy this film. Eisenstein's genius is captured in this film. This film gets great response from audiences. Eisenstein has such an impact on the film industry and this film cannot be missed. This film interprets and comments on the idea of revolution and the ugly side of revolution. Especially worth noting is the fact that this is a silent film and yet the ugly, disturbing, emotional, and thought provoking images don't need a single word. This is a masterpiece film. If you enjoy film, get this one in your library.
