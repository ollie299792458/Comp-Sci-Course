When Happy Birthday To Me originally came out, it was one of the quirkiest yet memorable horror films of its time. Everyone who saw it and liked it can remember scenes, characters, lines. It has massive nostalgia cachet. Having waited a long time for its DVD release, I was literally unable to watch it, because one of my favourite elements was missing: the haunting, elegant original score. In its place is insipid, direct-to-video jazzy drivel that kills the mood before the credits are finished rolling.  It makes one wonder why people who clearly have no understanding of the genre are put in charge of marketing the DVD releases of classics. I could forgive--if not really understand--the decision to replace the classic poster with a bland new photo of an anonymous model holding a birthday cake (wonder if it occured to these geniuses that people looking for HBTM might miss its new incarnation) but the new music score is literally unforgivable. This one is going in the garbage. I would rather have wasted my money than have my memories of this fine film ruined. Perhaps if enough people don't buy it, Columbia might get the message that if they own a property fans love, they should respect the people they want as an audience.
