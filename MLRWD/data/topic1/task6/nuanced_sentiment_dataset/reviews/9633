This film is everything that modern character studies long to be. 'Five Easy Pieces' is revealing about a wayward culture; it strikes the audience with its emotional interactions; and lets us peer into the hearts and minds of very intriguing personalities.

The story follows Robert Dupea (Nicholson), who has abandoned his well-to-do, intellectual family for a proletarian lifestyle of manual labor and promiscuity. His impetus is clear from the beginning--our culture is restrictive and absurd, and must be rejected. But refuting his old life doesn't exempt him from the world's ludicrousness and we find him restless and discontented from the opening. Arguments with his girlfriend and the famous 'chicken salad sandwich' scene epitomize this agitation.

Dupea returns to his family under the pretext of attending to his ill father. There, he finds what he believes could be his salvation in the form of sophisticated woman who is also romantic and optimistic (she doesn't believe she's ever been bored). In her, Dupea sees reason and justification for his old life and considers it once again. A clash of interest results, generating the sharpest interactions and the bitterest of conflicts.

This clash is all that modern character studies aim for. Failing to show the value of the rejected old life, however, there is no good reason for the clash and the character is seen to be shallow and heartless, leaving the audience with nothing to study.

Enjoy this picture for the craftsmanship with which Rafelson molds the internal conflict, an art that is evidently admired these days and very rarely achieved.
