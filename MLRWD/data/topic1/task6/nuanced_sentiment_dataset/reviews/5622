I purchased this movie expecting it to be artistic and thoughtful, and guessed that the many negative reviews were just ignorant and undeserving. However, after watching just 5 minutes, I reached for the remote control, pressed Eject and threw out the disc in the garbage bin. It was painful to watch how many clich&eacute;es that can pass in so little time, delivered by just as miserable acting. No great movie has ever come out of such a crappy introduction, and therefore there was no need to waste a Saturday evening on this disaster. What a bad taste. This is surely not serving the painter Gustav Klimt any honour at all. I wonder how it managed to be awarded the best movie at Moscow International Film Festival. It must have been the only one present there. Don't be fooled by the title and cover - this is junk in disguise.

PS. Another comment about fluctuations between loud music/noise and very low mumbling also holds true. And it only leaves an even more unprofessional feel to the whole disaster. It should never have been released.
