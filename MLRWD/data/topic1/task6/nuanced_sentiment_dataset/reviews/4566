I hadn't seen City of the Dead, aka Horror Hotel, since I was about 10 years old and it scared me then.  I wanted to see if it had the same effect on me now as an adult, which it doesn't, but that's not to say it's not a genuinely eerie movie at times, with some very effective moments of creepiness.  The cover art on the case might give the impression that this is a color, schlock-slasher, nudie-girl horror movie, which it's not.  It's an excellently photographed; glorious black-n-white, restrained (and better for that) exploration of devil worship and witchcraft.

The real treat of this DVD, though, is a lengthy 2001 interview with Christopher Lee which is a part of the special features.  Mr. Lee is SO funny, so charming, and has such intelligent things to say about his career; about actors today; the state of the British film industry and about the British media.  He is so personable it's like having him sit in your living room talking with you.  I laughed out loud several times at his comments, he is just fabulous!  I enjoyed the movie, but I really think this DVD is worth getting just for this interview alone, and particularly if you're a fan of Christopher Lee.
