I've been working out to Jillian Michael DVDs for a few months so any new workout I do has to be rigorous otherwise my heartrate doesn't rise.  Mel B's workout, although simple, had my heart pumping with five minutes.  I had to sit down to take a quick breather.  I highly recommend this workout because the moves are simple and very easy on the knees unlike most cardio workouts on the market today.

Now, I give this dvd only 4 stars and here's why:

-1/2 star: Boring music.  It's like stripped chillout music with only drums and a synth or two in one continous track per workout segment.  You don't really notice the music because whoever mixed the audio track had the volume too low.  Just put on your own music and you'll be fine.

-1/2 star: Mel B's cueing & presence.  She jumps right into a move without really explaining what she's going to do.  It's not too bad at all if you've ever seen Turbo Jam (the worst cueing ever)!  Watch the DVD once then cues aren't really necessary since the moves are easy to follow.  Also, Mel B doesn't say much throughout the workout.  Lots of silent moments. I thought she would be a chatterbox!

Recommended!
