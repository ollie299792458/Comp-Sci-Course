I enjoyed the movie; but was a little disappointed when I discovered it didn't seem to live up to the pre-Academy Award hype.  Annette Bening's performance was good as expected; but I didn't feel bowled over.  Julianne Moore's performance was equally good, if not better. Mark Ruffalo was great in his role. At the end of the movie, I was not left with any emotions at play.
This may be the year of the f-word, given Melissa Leo's performance in The Fighter; but count me as an old fogey if I found that the repeated and seemingly gratuitous use of the word put me off.  At least in The Fighter, the word seemed more likely to be common vernacular for the people being portrayed.  In The Kids Are All Right, it was as if the producers were trying to reach a threshold that would guarantee an R-rating.  However, with the nudity, fleeting though it was, it would appear the R was a certainty even if they reduced the f-bombs by half.
I didn't begrudge the time I spent watching the movie; but it was not one of the best of the year.
