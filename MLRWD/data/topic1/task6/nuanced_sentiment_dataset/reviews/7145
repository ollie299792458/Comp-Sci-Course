Ouch! This is an utterly unwatchable vanity production and stands as a huge smear on an otherwise semi-remarkable career. Streisand is no actress, regardless of her insistences to the contrary. I pity the poor folks who had to suffer through being "directed" by Streisand and who had to all sign gag orders agreeing never to speak of the experience in public. I'd really like to hear what they went through to meet this "director's' VISION. LOL LOL LOL I mean, none of them ever worked with her again!

I am 1000% certain that "Gypsy" will NEVER be made, and I think that's a good thing. She is WAYYYYYY too old to carry that role off.

And the release of the new "Guilt Trip" movie has been delayed interminably, no doubt because of the negative having to undergo EXTENSIVE LAB WORK so that all the new HD technology doesn't show what Babs truly looks like these days.

Also a good thing!

And those of you fans who actually believe that a 12-disc DVD of unreleased "treasures" is really in the works need a wake-up call. That "project" was announced when BS renewed with SONY strictly to demonstrate that she could still conjure interest from her devoted fanbase. She promised this same thing back in the 80's, remember? So what's taking so long? I'll tell you: There is no 12-disc DVD set in the works but it behooves her financially to make you folks think there might be. Your disappointment is IRRELEVANT to her! That's how much she thinks of the people who made her what she is!
