jeez, this is a crazy movie. Where do I begin?
A few days ago, I saw a preview for this movie on Starz, and it looked like it would be a funny satire of slasher flicks. So, the next time it was on, I decided to watch it. This is easily the strangest, most confusing film I've seen all summer. Overall, it's pretty entertaining, but it's dragged down by strange, dumb, undeveloped characters and the fact that it gets a little boring as it moves along.
The film's protagonist, a girl named Florence wants to fit in with the surfing crowd. It takes a bit, but she finally gets accepted into the crowd, and her new nickname is chicklett. Other characters include her nerdy friend, a slutty girl, an actress hiding away, a snooby weelchairbound girl, the sweedish exchange student, a very odd woman police officer (who happens to be the film's screenwriter, and her mother. However, just as Florence is starting to fit in with the surfers, she relizes something is wrong. She has strange blackouts, that she can't quite understand. However, the blank outs are caused by her being a schizophrenic. Whenever she sees circles, she turns into the evil, snobby Ann Bowman, and whenever she becomes Ann, people get hacked to bits. 
The film is fun, and has some great one liners in it. However, there are flaws that cosideribly drag it down. One being is the characters. No one in the group of surfers is particularly developed well, nor are any of the surrounding characters. The only person developed well is Florence, everyone else is about as 3D as a peice of cardboard. Also, the film becomes a bit boring in between the murders. Aside from some entertaining bits, the film dosen't have anything that funny occuring during these parts. Don't even get me started on the acting either...
So, overall, Psycho Beach Party is a somewhat entertaing romp, but will most likely bore most of it's viewers. I only reccomend seeing it if you really want to, otherwise, leave it on the shelf.
