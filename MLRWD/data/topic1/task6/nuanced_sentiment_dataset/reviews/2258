I can't beleive the first Bond was "this"!!!
I saw it for the first time last saturday night with James Belushi making his funy jokes during commercials... well I have'nt missed anything at all...
The script is a real joke even for a 1960s movie, I admit that the budget, the FX were very limited, the 1960s mentality about male and female relations ("Honey")... but the way 007 wins the battle against Dr No, how he escape his cell throug the grid, in the tunel, even saturday morning cartoons are move adult than this...Bond is also a bit naive:
CIA agent (Jack Lord) put a gun in his back, then he just said : "Intelligence service" without showing any plates, any ID and Bond replies :"Oh, we're on the same side then..."
Wow, what a professional! A guy shows up from nowhere claiming to be from CIA and hop, We're on the same side, big smile, let's shake hands my patriotic fiend...
Very dispointed by this movie, not a very good start for the Bond serie, anyways, it's getting a little better after that (ThunderBalls)...
