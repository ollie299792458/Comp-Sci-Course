The words coming out of the mouth of Oscar Schell are too much like literature and much less like a kid talking, whatever the traumatic circumstances or special nature of his intellect.  Because he is a distant character, rather than empathizing with him, there were times I wanted to say to him, "Quit being a brat!"  He gets away with too much or maybe the part is just poorly written:  so obvious that he is saying to his mother what will hurt because he is hurting.  But so is everyone around him.  Sandra Bullock plays a fine, quiet and sympathetic role, long suffering her way through her husband's sudden death and the after math.  Tom Hanks is so idealized in his role there isn't a single person on this earth who wouldn't die a thousand times over in losing him.  The grandmother is one-dimensional and seemingly without much feeling except for one of protectiveness and availability to her grandson.  A relationship between she and her daughter in law does not seem to exist at all.  Overall, the screenplay is spotty and this topic, dramatized many times before and specific to this historic moment, has been much better explored in other films.  It is too bad:  so much talent, such poor writing evocative of a Nicolas Sparks' novel in trying to elicit as many hankies wet as possible by the end.  Maybe that was its purpose:  let's watch this movie and cry, cry a lot.
