I remember this movie when I first saw it in the Czech Republic, titled "Zivot pod Vodou', or 'Life Under Water'. The English title of course is "The Life Aquatic, With Steve Zissou". The movie shook my tree then and has remained one of my favorites since. It is a quirky take on a wannabe Jacque Cousteau-type oceanographer, played by Bill Murray, whose friend is eaten by a never-before-seen 'Jaguar Shark'. With his crew, Zissou then goes off in search of this magnificent creature. A Brazilian troubadour sings David Bowie songs in Portuguese throughout the film, and the underwater life is created with CGI animation that doesn't even attempt to look real. The movie drifts along, as if sailing for the sake of sailing, with no particular destination in mind. And I love it.
Like other Wes Anderson films, The Life Aquatic isn't just a comedy. Sure it is filled with hilarious easter eggs that warrant repeated views and closer inspection, but it is also frequently touching, artfully shot, and wonderfully acted. I reckon Wes Anderson movies aren't for everyone, but I get the sense watching The Life Aquatic (and Royal Tenenbaums and Darjeeling Limited, etc) that Wes Anderson movies aren't meant to be for everybody. He makes these movies because he likes the stories, and he knows how to tell them in a unique and quirky way. The Life Aquatic tickles me, and like Zissou on the Belefonte, every time I watch it I am happy enough just sailing along for the sake of sailing, watching a wonderful movie and not caring if it ever ends.
