Warning! Spoilers Below for anyone who has yet to see the first season!

Going into the Sopranos, I wasn't sure if it was going to be good or not.  Sometimes shows critics like aren't always the best.  And I'll have to admit, the first 3 or 4 episodes wern't anything special.  Then there was an episode called "College", which was definetly one of the finest hours of the season.  From then on every episode continued to be better then the next.  If I had to pick a favorite episode, I'd have to go with the season finale, "I Dream Of Jeanne Cusomona", for two reasons.  One, because of the superb scenes between and Tony and his physciatrist, Dr. Melfi(Lorraine Bracco, deliverying probably my favorite performance of the season.)And the second one is when Tony confronts his mother(Nancy Marchand) after she has a stroke.  THis was definelty my favorite scene of the season.

There is not a bad performance on this show.  If I had to pick three, it would be Lorraine Bracco, James Gandolfini, and Nancy Marchand.  These three are just perfect.

There is a body count, severel people have been killed.  One of the main chracters fate is left open at the end of the season
