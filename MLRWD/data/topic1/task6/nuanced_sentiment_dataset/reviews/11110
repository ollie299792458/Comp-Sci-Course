Out of all of the Dracula movies, I think this is the only one that could actually make sense to us skeptics out in the world.  
The version of Bram Stoker's Dracula is more on a fictional line then we would like to think.  We know it is losely based on the life of Prince Vlad of Walachia.  Dracula 2000 was more of a believable idea.  
The acting in this movie isn't the best.  Jennifer Esposito, who was on Spin City and also in the movie "Summer of Sam", was very convincing and is an excellent actress.  Along with themain characters, she puts on a convincing performance.  I must say, I was dissappointed with Jeri Ryan (aka Seven of Nine on Star Trek Voyager)  She showed no emotion and played the character in this movie way too much like her character on Voyager.  
At times, the movie can be a bit sluggish, except at the end where the resolution was way too fast.  
I did like this movie for the fact that I could believe the story line.  It takes the legend of Dracula and makes it into something we can actually believe in.
