This is a very fine movie adaptation of a great musical. It can be difficult today to understand how groundbreaking this show was, not only in terms of subject matter, but in the way Rodgers and Hammerstein revolutionized the treatment of songs and their relationship to plot and characterization. Before R&amp;H, few musicals addressed serious issues. The musical numbers tended to be showstoppers designed to showcase the strengths of the performer: it wasn't unusual to lift a number out of one show and insert into another to suit the whims of whoever was the star of the moment. After Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein this became impossible: one could never, for example, take a song from The King and I and arbitrarily put it into Oklahoma! Gordon MacRae might not be John Raitt, but he's wonderful in this film, and Shirley Jones gives one of the best performances in the history of American movie musicals. There really isn't a weak link in this cast. I'll admit that, by today's standards, Carousel might seem a bit sentimental. If you're at all interested in American theatre history, you must see this. If, like me, you love musicals, you'll have to own it.
