Have watched all episodes from the beginning, own all of Season 6, 7, and 8 with last two in Blu Ray, and come to the conclusion that when the producers of Smallville gained rights to do the show, it was never expected to last for ten seasons.  It also limits Clark Kent to Smallville, growing into his Superman identity.... but the producers are not allowed  to have Smallville's Tom Welling appear as the red/blue/gold caped and flying Superman that everyone knows and loves.

NOT ALLOWED and the writers are trying to keep Smallville going with various plots that dance around different characters, trying to keep Lana in the Smallville Clark's life, with different enemies and issues including the not-the-real Jimmy Olsen being killed.

Season Ten is supposedly the last Smallville,,, disappointed in one way as the first seven seasons were fun to watch.  IF DC Comics and producers of Smallville were smart.. they would allow Tom Welling continue into the complete flying full blown Superman character that everyone expects.  Could be done as a major movie... or done as a two show introduction ,, really well done ... with Tom Welling dressed and acting like Superman character, with several shows using Justice League characters, Superman with Lois , etc. etc.

Movie Superman Returns didn't go anywhere.  Smallville and Tom Welling, with good writing and stories could carry Superman for the next decade...

Bet season ten doesn't have Welling in red/blue Superman outfit and flying.  Any takers??

Season 9 is not as good as 8, which wasn't as good as 7 which was the end of the Smallville's good stories.. hate to say it because I'm a fan and enjoy watching the show.  Personally may wait till it gets cheap in Blu Ray to buy, having watched once, it's not something to invested premium dollars to buy ..
