Sibling rivalry a la Grand Guignol by way of SUNSET BLVD., this is Robert Aldrich's creepy take on what happens to two aging sisters, former Hollywood stars who now live together, corrosively codependent.  At its 1964 release, much was made of the longtime "feud" between aging divas Davis and Crawford.  Several scenes of sadomasochism play off this mostly media-manufactured competition; eg. Davis (as former child star Baby Jane Hudson) brutally kicking a crippled Crawford around the floor of their dark, drapes-drawn parlor.  True to the story, both Davis and Crawford allow themselves to be seen in anything but Hollywood glamour shots: they forego vanity to achieve power.  Bitter, alcoholic Davis achieves a level of grotesquerie rarely portrayed on the big screen by "name" actresses of the era.  Fourteen years after Billy Wilder's SUNSET BLVD.(1950), Robert Aldrich's film is not of the artistic calibre of Wilder's SUNSET which could just as easily have taken the title "Whatever Happened to Norma Desmond?"
This Davis/Crawford pairing engendered something of a sub-genre of has-beens returning to the screen as psychopathic killers, great film actresses having to play perhaps the only parts they were offered (HUSH, HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE; WHO SLEW AUNTIE ROO?, etc.)  Special commentary on DVD would have been nice.
