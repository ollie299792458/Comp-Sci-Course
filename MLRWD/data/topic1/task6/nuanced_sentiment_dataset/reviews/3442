.....and I do like it. It is a powerful story concerning the rescue of 2 trapped police officers from the rubble of

 the World Trade Center. How the 2 officers survived not only the inital collapse but being trapped under mountains

of debris for many hours is miraculous. Despite it's Hollywood budget (special effects are amazing) and engrossing

storyline, I couldn't help but feel that the movie missed the mark somewhat.

My main problem for me is the lack of emotion I felt. There was no 'goosebump' factor involved at any stage of the

movie. Perhaps it is due to 9/11 being the most photographed disaster of our times and I've seen (like

most other people) raw, gut wrenching emotion from real people on the day and afterwoods with relatives hoping for

a miracle that their loved ones somehow survived. I don't think the actors in the movie managed to reach that level

of emotional intensity.

Which leads me onto the performance of the actors. For me the performances were too 'Hollywood'. A strange statement

to make I'm sure, but as a regular viewer of indi and arthouse movies (especially foreign movies) where the actors

often go to emotional levels rarely seen in big budget Hollywood movies, the performances in WTC failed to match

them.

Overall I would rate WTC as a 'good' movie, not a 'great' one. It is a compelling story based on the amazing survival

of 2 police officers trapped in the rubble of the WTC, though if Hollywood could look past profit and appealing to

the lowest common denominator, perhaps it could have been amazing.

Note about the special features on the 2-disc edition - worth the price of the DVD alone. We get an indepth look

at the film making process and a thorough insight in the lives and experiences of the 2 trapped police officers.
