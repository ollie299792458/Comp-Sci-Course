When I watched this program on TV I was impressed with the stunning shots and "poetic rendition". No, I do not mind the long stretches without narration; in fact, I like the music ...

Then I found out how they made this film -- as you probably also have heard. The filmmakers hatched and trained some of the birds, they took blue-screen shots and cut-and-pasted them on top of scenery pictures, they transported birds to unnatural habitats, and on more than one occasion they faked some events, such as putting birds in fake "oil" to mimic industrial pollution ..

Come on, pretty pictures are good to look at, but there ought to be a higher law. One of Gandhi's Seven Sins is "Science without Humanity". What the filmmakers did was no science, and they did it with little compassion for their subject. By exploiting and harassing birds they concocted a series of pretty pictures, but what is the point? We are supposed to admire the beauty and freedom of these birds, we are supposed to learn to appreciate the diversity of life and how progress has destroyed natural habitats, and (if I can infer a little further) reflect how we can adapt a more sustainable lifestyle so as to leave some space for our fellow species. But if what we see is but an illusion, how can we learn anything at all?
