Granted the students were naturalistic and believable. Their performances are the highlight of the film.  That being said, I forced myself to sit through 2 hours and 10 minutes of tedium hoping to find some other redeeming value to Francois Begeaudeau's self-indulgent effort.  He portrays (and really is) a teacher at an inner-city Paris school who has to deal with a multi-ethnic composition of students in his French class.

Repeatedly, he attempts to be their "pal" until their behavior becomes intolerable and then he lays down the law. It is a given that students look for consistency in a teacher since their own moods can be so volatile from day to day. His behavior is as inconsistent as theirs. In addition, he incessantly argues with them and tolerates their sarcasm, insults, and other inappropriate behaviors up to the point where he loses control of his own frustration and anger. Since when does a teacher leave the classroom unattended to walk a student to the Principal's office? All of this adds up to a text book example of incompetent classroom management.

There are no memorable examples of his so-called teaching skills and yet in the last few minutes of the film the students magically report how much they've learned and sound like they might be on the fast track to becoming Rhodes scholars some day.

Although its established early on that Francois Begeaudeau is in his fourth year of teaching at the school, he comes across like an ill-prepared first year teacher who doesn't have a clue.  And I haven't a clue as to why this film gets so many kudos.
