If you havent seen this movie yet. DONT. Buy the original with James Stewart. Its about 100 times better.

Where do I start. The film has one great scene and that is of the plane crashing. Thats it. After that we get one bad scene after another. We never get to know the characters like we do in the original. They seemed more forced in this version. There are some lines pulled right out from the orignal but they cant save this trainwreck, they are delivered so badly its embarassing. When the plane gets buried in sand the passengers dig out not only the plane but the surrounding area as well but it looks like they manage to dig out a HUGE area around the plane that would take bulldozers a week to dig out. Theres a stupid scene where the passengers start dancing to a song on a cd player. These guys have just crashed, low on water, working day and night to build a plane and they are goofing off dancing? Dont even get me started on some of the life speeches in this film. I also got a good laugh after the film they put pictures of the characters and what they did after they were rescued. The model designer was on a magazine cover now working for NASA. Cheesy as hell.

The only people who will can possibly enjoy this film are KIDS
