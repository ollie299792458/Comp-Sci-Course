My husband bailed out when the singer started in on "Come Live with Me..." I stayed with the film and enjoyed the fun. There's not much sense of the sad history of the Lancaster-York rivalry, with the original sin of the deposition and murder of Richard II leading in an almost fatalistic way to rebellion, wars, and cold-blooded murders, all the way down to the innocent victims in the Tower. (For that, go to the BBC version.) That's a quibble, however; this is a "variation on a theme," and I can't quarrel with the simplifications.  What I mind more is the loss of so much of the poetry. But if Clarence is going to be interpreted as a kindly, inept soul, "False, fleeting, perjur'd Clarence" has to go. Giving the lords' line "How have you slept, my lord?" to Elizabeth of York the morning after is a little bizarre, but it works in the context.
BTW, some people think Henry VII killed the little princes, but that's not an idea one could expect Shakespeare to float.
