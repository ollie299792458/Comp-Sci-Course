 ...........MY ReView.......

After, viewing this DVD like 15 times (literally) after having it for about 2 weeks I still cry because of what torture these two have to indure. This is a Heartfelt film and it has helped me overcome some obstacles dealing with my sexuality and the way people see us.

This is a Must have DVD and also the Soundtrack is awesome as well, I can't stop listening to it.
