As others have told you everything you need to know and far too much if you'd like to be surprised and see the plot unfolding without your foreknowledge, I'll just add my two cents worth.

I saw this when it first came out, and I saw it again recently on you tube.  No, I'm not going to pay a small fortune for this DVD from Amazon, since it will probably be out for $5 in Walmart the year after next.

As an outdoorsman, I ask, how did these National Guardsmen keep from hypothermia?  The Cajuns were wearing clothing that you wear when it hits near freezing.  Yea, I know that they're outdoors, so wear more than we would simply making it from car to building, but come on, the Guardsmen were soaked in weather so cold that at least one Cajun wore a down vest.  No sleeping bags, no tents--no way!

Why Cajuns keep dancing during a gunfight 30 yards away is beyond me.  Sure, they killed two pigs with guns.  But where is common sense?  As if they didn't know SOMETHING was wrong with all that gunfire, even if they couldn't see it?

And the "bloopers".  Didn't Stucky have LIVE ammunition slung over his shoulder?  Or do blanks look that real?  And how did a handful of live ammo last "so long"?  And the song "Parlez-nous a Boire" must have been doctored.  As I listened, the first verse was sung once, and the second verse sung thrice.  The song actually has four verses plus the refrain.  I assume that the sound engineers are responsible for that one.

I did appreciate that they used "real Cajuns".  Looking at that crowd near the end of the movie, nearly everybody had dark hair, and most of the faces were typically French (I spent some time in France).  That's French culture, all right.  They didn't have a bunch of blond-haired blue-eyed "American" Indians like on one movie I saw.

It really is a great movie, even if it leaves me wondering what Cajun culture is REALLY like.
