One of the best comedies ever to be placed on the silver screen. One mans quest to give his family the ultimate vacation, only to find out their destination is closed,(Wally World....similar to Six Flags), Clark takes matters in his own hands for his familys sake, they think he is going nuts, the audience also agrees with that. The scenes that lead to the conclusion are blueprint Sat. Night Live material, funny, genious, and side splitting. Chevy was the man in the days, miss seeing him on film, Fletch, X-mas Vacation, Caddyshack, etc. We are introduced to cousin Eddie for a brief moment, but he steals the show. In X-mas vacation his role is much bigger and your smile will hurt after watching him preform. They just don't make films like this anymore, slap on the National Lampoons title and people exspect greatness, not any more, Van Wilder sucked and many others too. Check out Chevy at his best, possibly cocaine motivated, so what, he is awesome. Harold Ramis rocks also, check out Stripes and Caddyshack. Classic comedys that will make potential screewriters think of how can we come up with someting to this caliber, they can't, it has been done. Chevy rules, the God of S.N.L.
