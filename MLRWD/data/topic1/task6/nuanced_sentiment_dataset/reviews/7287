"Davie and Golimyr" is a charming religiously-themed storybook tale, if you don't mind the message, which should come as no surprise as it's based on the story of David and Goliath.  It's about an aspiring young warrior named Davie, who is the only resident of the land of the Zites to stand up to the terrible giant Golimyr, with the help of his flying sheep Chops. Golimyr hears of the "faith" that the Zites possess, and he decides to take it as though it were a treasure, then force the Zites to bow to him as their new king.  So Davie becomes, quite literally, "defender of the faith".  It's told in rhyming couplets reminiscent of Dr. Seuss' verse, though not as clever.  But the strength of this video is the amusing and inventive stop-motion animation and design, based on the work of illustrator James Christensen, which makes it enjoyable to watch and makes the message that much more palatable.  It's, needless to say, appropriate for family viewing, at least school-age children and above.
