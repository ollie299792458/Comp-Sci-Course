This is a brilliant horror film.  If you like horror films and haven't seen this one, you're in for quite a treat.  By far the best and most fun of George Romero's "Dead" triology, this is also, in my opinion,  the best horror film ever made.
Four survivors of a world-wide  yawning-grave zombie plague hole up in an abandoned shopping mall and fend  off the mindless swarm of zombies that pose a threat to their continued  existence.
Romero does a terrific job of constructing an equally creepy  and adventurous atmosphere.  Being a child of the seventies, some of my  earliest memories are of wandering around large shopping malls in tow of my  mom.  Place has always been an important thing for me, and this movie is  definitely a movie with a spirit of "place".  This movie touched  something deep in me the first time I saw it when I was about 14, and I've  loved it ever since.  There's plenty of wonder, adventure, fun, and humor  to balance the film's apocolyptic creepiness and bright-red comic book  gore.  I also love the love-of-film-making which makes itself so evident in  the film's camera angles, editing, choice of music, and montage shots.
It  would doubtlessly be terrifying to truly be one of the last few people left  on the face of the earth with warm blood flowing through your veins, but  there's something about imagining banding together with a couple of friends  and taking on a world of zombies that seems so...well, so fun.  "Dawn  of the Dead" makes it seem like it might just be the time of your  life.
An excellent film, maybe not perfect in all technical senses, but  clearly making up for any flaws with an abundance of style, mood, and  substance.
I just hope George Romero decides to release another version  of this DVD including a commentary track, as he did with the recent DVD  relases of his other great films "Knightriders" and  "Martin".  Of course, I also hope his name will be returning to  the big screen sometime soon.
