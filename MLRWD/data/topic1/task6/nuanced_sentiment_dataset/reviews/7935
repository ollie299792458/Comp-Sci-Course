This movie is terrible. I mean really, really bad. I guess it's supposed to be a comedy, but there are absolutely no laughs to be found. The movie is one very long fat joke that doesn't work and is stretched to an hour and a half. I think the Farelly Brothers were attempting to make a "message movie" but I think it is actually sort of offensive to overweight people. 
Jack Black is a funny guy, but he hasn't made a good movie since "High Fidelity." He's not funny at all in this, it's a total waste of his talent... Jason Alexander? Not funny at all. The Farelly Brothers are continuing to prove what hacks they are as filmmakers. After making three great comedies in a row - "Dumb and Dumber," "Kingpin," and "There's Something About Mary," they've now delivered their second straight dud (fourth if you count Osmosis Jones and the Farelly-produced "Say It Isn't So"). Even in those three classic comedies I questioned their movie-making skills but at least they provided laughs. 
Do yourself a favor and don't watch this godawful mess. I wish I could say, "Well, it's really stupid but it has funny parts" but there are no funny parts.
