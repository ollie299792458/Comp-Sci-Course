Grace is about a thirty something Madeline who's married to some schlub named Michael,  They have been trying to have a baby for sometime.  Mike's mother Vivian wants to make sure Madeline has the kid in a hospital but she wants to have a midwife named Patricia (her old lover) deliver it.  But before any of their plans transpire, a freak car accident leaves Mike dead and Maddy her unborn child in some serious trouble.  A few days later her water (er red Flavor Aid) breaks and she's rushed to the midwife's place to have the baby.  Expecting a still birth but a miracle happens and Maddy gives birth to a child that she names Grace.  But that is when things get wonky.  Throw in some strained in-law relationship, a jealous young lesbian, a ghoul baby and a single mother going batty and you have Grace.

A mediocre film that pays homage to superior films such as the It's Alive trilogy, Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.  I didn't care for the characters because they all seem annoying.  The mother-in-law is the chief antagonist who schemes to snatch the baby.  The ex-lover/midwife Patricia is creepy as she keeps tabs on her old lover and only cares about moving in on the now dead Mike's turf.  In one scene she tries to rekindle the old flame a few days after the physically and emotionally exhaustive birth but gets cut off at the overpass and her young squeeze is VERY jealous of the attention that she gives to Madeline.  The men in this film are nothing more than ciphers who are manipulated by the females in the film (i.e. Vivian and her hen pecked hubby and Mike who's nothing more than a warm body and bread winner).

Not recommended.
