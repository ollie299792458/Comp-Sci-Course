I don't claim to understand everything about this film, nor have I read the book. But despite being confused, I was blown away by the movie for it's execution of both the larger picture of literal alienation and overwhelming human culture, and also the small, inconclusive details that make you sit back and think "huh?".

It's a slow film for the most part, but I was able to stay with it without much struggle due to the captivating photography and the excellent performance of David Bowie. He is fascinating to watch in this role, both inscrutable and deeply human. The manipulation of time also keeps you engaged, though maybe at times out of sheer determination to understand the purposeful ambiguities of the story.

So to conclude, I'd say that this film will probably be frustrating to many people (especially, from what I've heard, those who have read the more lucid book). But for those who want to contemplate its possible meanings, or simply have the patience to let the experience wash over you, it will be captivating and thought-provoking.
