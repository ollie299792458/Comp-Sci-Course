Perhaps you've seen Cameron Crowe's `Almost Famous'.  I will agree with others who say that `Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist' is this generation's `Almost Famous' and if so, it lives to the standards.  But this movie is so much more than a typical romance, comedy, or romantic comedy.  It's a story about love, without all the gimmicks and perfectly synched love connections.  It is exactly what high school love, and yes, even love in general, can often become: a series of smoothing out awkward, rough communication barriers and blunders.  Nick and Nora don't fit perfectly like a puzzle, but they form a bond through shared struggles.  Much like most anyone we meet.  Their romance is as real as Hollywood gets.

Michael Cera and Kat Dennings play their roles wonderfully, and along with a good supporting cast, an intense screenplay, and just the right amount of lighting and editing, this DVD is the best releases of 2009 thus far.  Specifically, I want to put its superb quality and excellence on not only the soundtrack, but also the score, which sets the mood perfectly.

Other reviewers are correct, there is crude humor.  It lies on the higher threshold of a PG-13 movie, and some scenes have intense, stomach-churning puke scenes.  Nora's best friend Caroline is grotesque, but like a dark backdrop, it makes Nora shine all the brighter.

Buy this movie.  At least watch this movie.  If you enjoy the `Juno' and `Superbad' era of teenage angst, you will enjoy `Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist'.  Even if you don't, you'll probably find at least some aspects of it highly enjoyable/entertaining.
