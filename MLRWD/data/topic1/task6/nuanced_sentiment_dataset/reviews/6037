A ghost story set within a submarine?  What a novel idea!  I mean...being inside a dark submarine is kind of creepy as it is, right?  Add in a touch of mystery, suspense, and horror (equal parts) and you have yourself a movie.  It helps that Darren Aronofsky (Pi, Requiem for a Dream) helped write and David Twohy (Pitch Black) skillfully directs it.  Plus, Bruce Greenwood (13 Days) delivers another understated performance that will make him an actor to watch in the coming years.  But he doesn't steal the show, as all of the actors do a wonderful job.  Those expecting a horror movie will be disappointed because this is more of a mystery with horror elements.  The mystery involves who is haunting the ship and why.  The movie moves at a nice pace and is not overly long, which sabotages some submarine movies in my recent memory.  But the scares are pretty much pedestrian: people all of a sudden appear surprising a character, eerie sounds, etc.  There is one very effective scare tactic involving a mirror that makes a crew member go crazy.  I probably would have too had it been me looking into the mirror.
 This movie should have received more attention before hitting the video stands and hopefully will get more attention now.  There are not a lot of extra features, but those that are on the disc are very well done.  For instance, the deleted scenes are kept to five (instead of feeling like you are watching yet another movie) and the documentary is presented in a very unique way.  We get to see setting up the scenes and the actors caught on videotape, but it's the presentation that sets it apart.  A diagram of the sub is shown and the camera travels to different areas of the sub to show what scenes were shot where.  It always confuses me how subs are laid out, and this helped to some degree.
