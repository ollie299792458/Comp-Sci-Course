First I have to say that this editorial reviewer above this is an idiot. He obviously never read the Tarzan books because in actuality the man that teaches Tarzan language and brings him back to society is a Frenchman. They did not just make this up for the movie, though they did make up a few other things.
I am a huge Tarzan fan, mostly the first 4 books, (there are 24 total.) This movie is most definitely the closest in relation with the book, but it still does not quite do it justice. The beginning is very well done, and Christopher Lambert (I think) does an excellent job of playing Tarzan, he's more like the Tarzan in the book and less like the Tarzan that Hollywood has concocted. It's pretty and holds your attention, but in the end is a bit of a dissapointment. It captures the spirit, but I still feel like I've never seen the Tarzan story captured perfectly on film. I think I'll just have to do it myself one day. It's fun to watch and good to see if you're a fan of the books just to get a glimpse of another person's interpretation. (And they've got Bilbo playing Tarzan's buddy! How funny!)
