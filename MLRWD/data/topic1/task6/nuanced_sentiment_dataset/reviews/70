This is the story of Pius XII,whom the Italians called'il papa senza spina'. Forced to choose between two evils :the  Stalinism ,who murdered Catholics in Spain and Katyn, and Hitler with whom he had concluded a Concordat. He decided against a public stand against naziism and instead sheltered Jews to the extent of his ability.His Sainthood is still a matter of debate. The DVD, an anxiously awaited new Costa-Gavras( Z ,Missing) is technically flawed.Costa a Greek directed German actors in French and released a dubbed version in English without subtitles, making the dialogue incomprehensible.I am glad I did only rent the DVD and still hope a French(original) version with subtitles will be released someday.Also the Director needed a technical advisor. Some of the uniforms are incorrect and the main actor was not promoted from 1st Ltnt, nor the doctor fromBrigadier through the entire war Well, it was not supposed to be a documentary. The directors genius was only hinted at , with the endless flow of loaded and unloaded trains across the scene , symbolizing the passing of time while indifference prolonged the suffering.
