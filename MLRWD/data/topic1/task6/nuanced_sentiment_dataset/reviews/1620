Samuel L. Jackson as tyrannical neighbor and cop Abel Turner, embodies the manifestation of what most of present day society likes to believe is an anachronism, a relic of a past generation wholly incapable of adaptation and acceptance of belief systems that contradict his experiences. From the moment Abel espies his new next door neighbors, Chris and Linda Mattson (Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington) a young interracial couple only interested in establishing a solid foundation to their recent marriage, it is evident the best that can be hoped for is strained association. Abel holds court with an iron fist completely devoid of the silk glove in all of his interactions and relationships; with his two children, with his fellow cops and most especially, as the self-ordained caretaker of the cul-de-sac.

For the three quarters of the film, Jackson's character grows increasingly dislikeable and threatening  while the Mattsons' also face some customary encumbrances that may confront any newlywed couple but compounded by the additional factors of ethnic distinctions and the intrusive neighbor. Ron Glass, in a supporting role as Linda Matteson's father, adds context where one can see that Turner's beliefs are not necessarily foreign to his generational peers. Yet, as the film progresses it unfortunately follows a path that leads to only one possible outcome, one that belies what the viewer has come to understand about Turner and his motivations.

As usual Kerry Washington is absolutely alluring but the script does not offer much to work with as far as acting range and expressiveness are concerned. This a film that is not completely insulting but in the end it is little more than a moderately violent variation of a far too predictable theme.
