I saw this movie a long while back,and thought it was,still is,a great suspense thriller.I only wonder what the film might have been like had they finished the first original version with Nicole Kidman.They were well into filming when Kidman hurt her leg during a stunt/scene that went wrong,that is why the film ended up costing so much to make,they had to re-start from the very beginnnig again,now that Nicole Kidman,while she was recovering from her on set injury,was replaced by Jodie Foster.Both actresses have a differant look,and a differant acting style,to their performances,so it would be very interesting to see all the footage from the first version with Nicole Kidman,and compare it with the second,re-done,re-filmed,final release version with Jodie Foster,I hope they release the very rare first version,which,according to sources,was well over half-way completed,as a matter of fact, just about all of the first version starring Nicole Kidman had actually been completed when she was injured in that very unfortunate on-the-set accident,which forced the film makers to start from scratch.Maybe for a future Blu-Ray release of the movie we will finally get to see this rare shelved footage version,I sincerely hope so!
