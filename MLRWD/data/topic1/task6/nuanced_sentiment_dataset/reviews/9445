To start off, this review will not be professionally done.

I did not like this movie because it pays too much emphasis on loosely tied in cliches and poor plot workings. This is a movie that almost solely takes place in an elevator after all. So much attempted drama is placed on mundane info on the characters that ultimately don't play much of a factor in the ending.

The director used many stereotypical properties of a man without faith on the main officer overseeing the elevator. The depressed, burned out cop who loses all he held dear in life debunks the idea of anything supernatural and the religious zealot security officer goes into saying, "[we] are dealing with the thing you try to not to believe in..." As if to argue the point that all athiest are more or less putting on a show saying that they believe in nothing and being less credible than anyone who believes in their diety(ies). I am not an athiest, but the projection of one was crudely put together by the same kind of quality one would find from the mind of a drunk religious official on a mindless rant.
The twist at the end was lower quality than that of M. Knight Shyamalan (Shama lama dng dong lol).

The movie did accomplish one thing. It motivated me to play video games or read a book by H. P. Lovecraft, something more believable than the movie. When I watch a movie, I look forward to being able to escape reality and go on this eccentric adventure, not be reminded that I am watching a movie and not doing something more productive like brushing the hair of a bald man.
