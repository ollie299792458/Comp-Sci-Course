As movies go, it was not terrible.  It had great comedic moments, like Annette Benning's initial conversation with the gossippy manicurist.  However, why didn't they just hire Kim Cattrall to play that role?  It was essentially the same character as SATC's Samantha.  In fact, Kristin Davis would have played the Debra Messing character perfectly, and Sarah Jessica Parker even has the same wild hair Meg Ryan's character had.  Candice Bergen was already in SATC so her placement in The Women was a short reach. I also must add that Jada Pinkett Smith is too talented and beautiful to be relegated to the token black/ lesbian sidekick.  And quite frankly, Annette Benning's snippy comment to the woman with the dog at the beginning of the movie-about how she was wearing last years shoes- made me smirk.  Lady, (and yes, I know she was a fictional character) most of the world can't afford shoes and the rest of us shop at Payless.  Yet, I will probably continue to watch movies about spoiled rich ladies and continue to be glad I'm not friends with them.  What a hypocrite am I :)
