I should have stopped watching it an hour in, but no, I thought it would get better. Pretty much literally nothing happens in this movie. By that I mean scary or spooky. This is supposed to be a haunted house/ghost movie. Well, it is not. Or maybe I should say it's attempting to be, but fails miserably. The acting is pretty good, which I expected with Sara Paxton and Kelly McGillis in it. That's the only good thing I can say about it. Get ready for plenty of lulls of boredom if you watch this!

WARNING! ****SPOILERS**** BELOW!

The first 1 hour and 15 minutes of the movie virtually nothing happens other than the 2 main stars pulling childish scares/pranks on each other that was not remotely scary, Sara Paxton having a dream about the woman who hanged herself(not scary either), and two piano keys playing by themselves(definitely not scary). The last 20 or so minutes is when all the stuff that's to supposed to be scary happens. In that last section you get the two main actors going to the basement to contact the ghost of the woman I mentioned previously(not remotely spooky), Sara Paxton discovering the wrists slit corpse of what I'm guessing is the ghost woman's lover from way back when(this man/corpse checks into the hotel earlier in the movie and it never explains who this man is), and then finally Sara going back down to the basement and just before she goes down there we(the audience) see the ghost of the hanged woman(sorry I can't remember her name) over her shoulder, Sara turns, see's this, and takes off down the stairs, see's the ghost of the man who slit his wrists(briefly) and then is cornered by the ghost woman at a locked cellar door and thats the end of the movie, other than a brief epilogue that shows Sara Paxton being wheeled out on a gurney. We see about 10 seconds of ghost when she's cornered, which I didn't find scary at all. It doesn't show her getting killed or even mentions how she got killed. She did trip going down the stairs and split her head open. Did she die from that? From fright? Did the ghost kill her? Anyway, nothing about that last 20 minutes was remotely scary. The story of the ghost woman wasn't developed enough. Nor was the story of the old man who slit his wrists, either.

****END OF SPOILERS****

This movie almost put me to sleep due to nothing happening throughout the whole movie. There were 2 or 3 minute periods of time where I was in a daze. This is without a doubt the worst horror film I've seen. Very little ghosts. Zero spooks and scares. The acting isn't enough to save this atrocious movie from the pits. What baffles me is how anyone could score this more than 2 stars, which a number of people have, unless they have seriously been deprived of ghost movies for a long time. Very boring movie than you shouldn't even waste your time renting unless you like lots of inaction or you just want to see how good of an actor Sara Paxton is. If the latter be the case, I can recommend much better than this that she's in. I give this movie 2 stars out of 10 and that's only because of the very good acting. The execution of the movie gets a 0 out of 10! Bad!
