I first saw this in the theater many years ago, and I own an old VHS copy. Now I will be ordering the DVD. There were no weaknesses in this movie for me. It is beautiful, haunting, thoughtful, and ultimately uplifting. Charles Martin Smith turned in an outstanding performance, and is convincing as an introverted scientist who is at ease in the desolate tundra landscape. Brian Dennehy is perfect in his small role, and I never tire of watching his performance. The story seems simple and straightforward, and the wonder of the movie is how deep it really is. I was moved along so gradually that I hardly noticed how involved I had become in the movie, and yet the effect was instant when it ended - I watched it again and again. All these years later it is still among a short list of my favorite movies. I don't know how many times I have watched it, but each is as enjoyable as the first. It is truly a loss for many people who have never heard of the movie, who may never see it. The book was also good, but here is a rare example of a movie far surpassing the book.
