It was great to see all of the narration put back into the film, but this so called "Uncut" edition, is not what is seems.  Being a life-long fan and collector of "Fantasia" items, I was shocked to see (or not to see), the small black centaurette pyganinnies, totally removed from the film in the "Pastoral Symphony". Disney's "pan &amp; scan" techinque in one sequence chopped them out and when Bacchus is ushered up the stairs, they have been totally wiped out of the segment (the carpet now rolls itself up to the throne...ah,Disney magic).  I have many of the above mentioned sequences on video and was really hoping that they would find their way back into the DVD "uncut version".  I realize that in this age of 'racial discrimination" that certain things can't be shown or referred to, but give me a break, "Fantasia" is art and should not have been censored, besides, these are mythical creatures. Also,......I remember Deems Taylor as having a different voice, the one in the DVD really does not sound like him at all.  Anyway these are my thoughts. Having waited so long for the "uncut version", I feel very let down.
