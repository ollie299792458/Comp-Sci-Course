I must agree with some of the previous reviews.  This Darger character is pretty interesting and the works he produced are quite astounding, if not a bit infantile.

Nevertheless, I found the documentary difficult to follow.  For me, I was definitely not a fan of using Dakota Fanning, or any other child's voice to narrate many portions of the film.  The kid's voice was simply grating.  One shouldn't be constantly reminded of "poltergeist" (theeey're here...) when trying to  watch a film about a Chicago janitor.

What is truly unconscionable is the fact that the director choose to "animate" Darger's paintings.  This is very disappointing and suggests that the director did not have enough confidence in either the subject matter or the audience.  When showing Darger's paintings, I didn't need to see little soldier's arms moving in some rip-off Monty Python-esque style.  To me, this ploy reflected inexperience not artistry.  Just imagine a film about Ed Paschke in which his flourescent wrestlers and other characters "came alive" and started moving their arms and speaking--it would be ridiculous and an insulting move by the director (note, in no way am I comparing Paschke to Darger).

It's worth noting that most of the reviews posted here give people's opinions about Darger himself, not the movie.  Darger's idiosyncratic lifestyle is more than suitable for a documentary, I just didn't particularly care for the style that Yu chose to represent the story.

In all, this could have been a much more watchable documentary had it simply followed a more basic format.  Sure, I can understand that documentary filmmakers, like other artists, should push the boundaries of their genre.  However, the sign of a good filmmaker is someone who knows when to push the boundaries and when to simply let the material speak for itself.  Yu does way too much of the former, and the result is a film that seems  to promote its own cleverness at the expense of Darger's.
