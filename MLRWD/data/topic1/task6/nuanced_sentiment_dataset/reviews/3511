Do not expect this to be a strict interpretation of Emma, but an enjoyable one nonetheless. I personally like Romola Garai, and for the most part I enjoyed watching her as the ever vain but good-natured Emma. But oftentimes I found myself cringing a bit-- Romola's Emma was occasionally a bit overdone.  My biggest pet-peeve (although something many modern viewers would not mind) was that she never carried herself the way a woman in Austen's age was expected to.  She frequently flopped into or slumped in chairs and bounded into rooms.  The camera work and set was very good, and the actors were well chosen for their parts, but aside from Mr. Knightley, the characters were approached a bit differently than what I have read and seen before.  Some additions were made to the storyline, such as the focus on the emotional difficulties of Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill over being separated from home as children...and the marriage between Emma's sister and Knightley's (grumpy/discontent) brother.
