Though it held my attention for its relatively short length, this film ultimately fell short of dazzling me with insight. I've known a few people whose families were wealthy enough that they never had to work or worry, and, while they weren't bloomberg or trump-level wealthy, I find the difference of degree to be meaningless at that point, so there was less surprise in their personalities than I expected. I really don't mean this out of spite, but many subjects not only did not earn their money, but did not earn their place in a documentary either. There was nothing particularly dislikable about most of them, and many came off as amiable people who I wouldn't mind spending time with, but there was nothing very interesting about most of them either. Perhaps this was particularly on account of their young age -- most have accomplished nothing as yet; some will no doubt later go on to accomplish great things and others will be layabouts.

The film is also technically somewhat weak, and there are too many different people interviewed to afford each enough time for a developed portrait. Even for the more detailed characters, most footage seems to be culled from only a few interviews, so the film itself has a complacency and lack of work ethic.
