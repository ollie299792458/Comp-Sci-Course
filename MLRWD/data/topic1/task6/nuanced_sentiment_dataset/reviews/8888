derailed. only one word can explain this film...fair. i just watched this movie, being forced by my mother and sister, already expecting an uninteresting plot and boyhowdy i got one. the first hour of the movie, maybe a little longer, was painfully uninteresting. not only was the the plot boring, but so was the acting.this new guy, clive owen, brings nothing new to the table.jenifer aniston is...how should i say this... an emotionless doll. aparently "freinds" didnt help her in being dramatic. but surly..surly there must be a stand out character. well my freind u would be right. vincent cassel was the most interessting bad guys ive seen in modern film, he played the perfect "man you love to hate". any way the plot does heat up after the first hour, witch finally made me decide to give it 2 stars instead of 1. with a slow beginig, cheesy acting, and the feeling of unseriousness, makes this film just another modern thriller. u want a good edge of your seat masterpeace try some of the classic hitchcock films that this one seemed to copy
