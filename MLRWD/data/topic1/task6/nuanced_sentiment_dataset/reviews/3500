I had to chuckle about the comment of bringing religion into it?  I never even noticed or gave a thought other than the way the "priest" was pulled through a sewer hole he didn't exactly fit through.

An old relic of an abandoned church? or where ever the insides lead to.
To me the very high light was of the child with the clicking spoons and his mistaken idea that he had found a friend.

Sorvino was a pretty, conscientious leading lady played as a sympathetic
character that became better as the movie progressed.  Why would they used human DNA in the mixed genetics of their bug?

Is there really so many sub-tunnels under New York? that they built over the existing ones.  Other than that the mimicing roaches needed to be near a food supply [humans] there were lots of room to hide.
How come they didn't attack that group of weird ones the two boys passed in the tunnels.

Charles S. Dutton is a favorite character to look for and enjoying his performance.  Recognized Josh Brolin - too bad his character met his end.

Who, Who played the 6 foot tall roach. Person or artistic work - gruesome blend of parts to make a face.

Old buildings and underground tunnels have always fascinated me - especially how they came to be.  Any other spooks around?  By the way how does one male get all those females - seems like they would have been protecting him.  Loved the way Sorvino psyched it out.  Smart cookie.

The way it ended was so very touching and unexpected - have watched it 2 or 3 times already - probably again in another 6 months.

Definitely not for youngsters - but is of great entertainment value.
Enjoy!
