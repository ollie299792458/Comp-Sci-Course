I have seen a dozen or so movies that come very close to capturing the true art of filmmaking, but this one nails it.  Woody Allen's genius is all here, spread before us in a rich tapestry that validates in one perfect effort the suspicions that we have from watching his other films.  
The story is set on a lush canvas of Gordon Willis cinematography and George Gershwin score, and you are carried sweetly into the sublime swirl of New York City from the first rhapsodic blend of music, monologue and images.  For those who love New York (and those who may never see it) it should be known that the quintessence of the City is precisely captured here in sound, light, and character.
True to form, Allen strings his instrument with the requisite elements of life and relationships-- love, romance, friendship, betrayal, and essential insecurity-- and plucks them in perfect harmony.  In subtle brilliance, he does not lead you directly in this film, but allows you to go looking on your own volition for his simmering meaning of love and life.  The camera is a poignant voyeur as Allen's character searches earnestly (and obstinately) for answers to the wrong questions.  He is confounded but for the allure of the pure and benevolent Mariel Hemingway, who plays the angelic savior of his soul.
In the end, the ultimate message that Woody's character learns in Manhattan is the same rich reward that we earn from our experience in watching this movie... that hope, patience, and faith are the virtues that always keep their promises.
