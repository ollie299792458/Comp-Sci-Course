What better praise can I give a movie than to tell you that my ten year old son says he will memorize the lines in this movie because he likes it so much. It arrived today and he is already watching it for the second time. It is pure enjoyment. 
This Ron Howard directed film starring Jim Carey and narrated by Anthony Hopkins is destined to be a holiday classic; we waited in line at the theatre last December to see it, and afterwards we agreed that as soon as the DVD came out we would purchase it. It doesn't matter whether you like Jim Carey films or not; this adaptation of the Dr. Suess classic cloaks Carey's neurotic comedy under a mound of green fur and yellow eyes, puts him inside a cave and wraps him in the Christmas spirit of Whoville. If Carey is remembered for anything by filmgoers, his portrayal of the Grinch may just be the one. If the adults listen closely, there are even enough lines in the film that will make you laugh out loud. 
Well, my son's still laughing. So if you want to make that favorite child happy this holiday season, buy this DVD now.
