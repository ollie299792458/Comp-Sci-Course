I love this film...  I have absolutely no complaints about anything except that I could have watched more; didn't want it to end.  I remember when this film came out, seeing ads on tv about it, but was unable to see it at the theater.  I wish I could have seen this on the big screen because everything about this film is big.  The stunt with Hawkeye (Nathaniel) jumping thru the waterfall to the river below is absolutely fantastic.  Who performed this fabulous stunt???  This is a very moving action film and love story intertwined and they did a great job with it.  I absolutely loved Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe's performances.  There is major, and I do mean major,  chemistry between this couple.  The whole cast was excellent.  You either loved or hated the characters, depending on their behavior in the film, and they all depicted the individual they were playing very well.  The fight scenes are very realistic and I could actually watch them without flinching because even though the fights are brutal, you don't see body parts or blood flying. Also, there is no profanity and you never miss it which would be true in most films if they would just leave it out.  The music, Trevor Jones, and scenery at the Chimney Rock Park, N.C., take you to the place you should be in this film as you watch it.  Very, very well done and I loved every minute. You should definitely try this movie.
