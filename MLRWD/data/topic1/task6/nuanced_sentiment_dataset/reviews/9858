As you've probably gathered from other reviews, this film concerns a high school gym teacher, Mr. Woodcock, who berates and abuses his students. When Mr. Woodcock first hurled a basketball at a student and whacked him in the stomach, I chuckled in a startled way. But when such abuse went on and on and got more violent, it ceased to be at all funny. When the movie flashed forward 13 years to one of those abused students finding out his mother is going to marry this moron, I anticipated some interesting character interactions that hopefully would put this guy in his place. However, the film went nowhere, and most of the humor is based on ultra-foul language and sophomoric gags that made me think I was watching another awful teen movie. The formula quickly wore thin, and I felt sorry for the actors who must have regretted getting themselves into this mess, especially Susan Sarandon, who is one of my favorites. I know it's not good to give away the ending of films, so I'll just say that despite the low expectations that the film generates, I was still agog that the ending actually CONDONES the coach's bad behavior!! My only consolation is that I checked this DVD out free from a library so I didn't waste any money on it!
