Fred Astaire plays Jerry. And, Ginger Rogers play Dale. Ginger is just a lovely as ever. Fred was just so dashing. I just loved it when he sung Dancing Cheek to Cheek. The movie starts out with Jerry waiting for his friend Horton at a gentlemens club. They leave and go to Horton's hotel room to talk business. Jerry starts tap dancing and having a ball at it. However, he wakes up miss Dale who is in the room under him.  She comes up there to stop him, while he falls for her. They meet up in a thunder storm and her charms her with his singing and dancing. Later on, Howard wife sends her a massage that her husband is staying at that hotel and that she should meet him. So mistakes Jerry for Howard and slaps him. She then leave the hotel before he can talk to her. So he heads to Italy to meet up with her. Later they meet again and Howard wife convinces Dale to dance with Jerry. He than asks her to marry him and she slaps him. In haste she marries her boss. But Jerry meet s up with her and straightens out everything. Dale find out that a fake minister had married her and her boss. And Dale and Jerry live happy ever after.
