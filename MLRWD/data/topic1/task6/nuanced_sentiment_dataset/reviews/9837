Problem with Powder Blue is that it is calculated, dishonest stack of worn Hollywood cliche stories of people down on their luck that was multiplied times six and stories were chopped and mixed. Which made each of the character 6 times less likely to develop in any believable way. Just ask yourself how interesting is a stripper with a heart of gold and a son in coma looking for her soul-mate to take her to Paris? A Catholic priest that lost his wife in car accident that is trying to pay a transvestite prostitute a lot of money to kill him? Shy mortician that plays with puppets and never had a girlfriend? A good-looking waitress that is just there where you need her to refill your coffee cup and take you home to refill your heart with hope? And a lost puppy? And some stripping thrown in for a good measure?
But even worse than all those cliches is clumsy way they are mixed together. It is predictable to the gills and at the end some of the ridiculous resolution leave you in disbelief thinking "how exactly was I suckered into watching this load of crap". Well you do not have to be - just ignore this movie and get some Robert Altman instead if you want chop-suey type of story of several lonely people.
