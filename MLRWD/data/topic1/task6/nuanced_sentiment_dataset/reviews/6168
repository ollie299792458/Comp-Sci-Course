I would have given this two stars, the wife gave it 3, so 2.5 rounds up.
My take is that this is Patrick Dempsey's revenge for getting dumped by Reese Witherspoon in Sweet Home Alabama.  Now he gets to play the guy who struggles to get a second chance.  There are some amusing bits, and although there's enough female McDreamy swooning to make you wonder what's with this guy, there's also some self-deprecating humor as well.  All of the scenes set in New York are tolerable.  All of the Scotland stuff (and Kevin McKidd) were just too over the top for me.  Also, I felt like Michelle Monaghan deserved better than Dempsey's character, and that McKidd deserved much better than Monaghan's character, so fairly high degree of implausibility in the relationship meter for me.
Her take -- beautiful people, beautiful clothes, beautiful scenery, romance, comedy, a wedding, cute scenes, food, true love...all the ingredients for a movie that will put a smile on your face the day after.
Definitely a split decision...
