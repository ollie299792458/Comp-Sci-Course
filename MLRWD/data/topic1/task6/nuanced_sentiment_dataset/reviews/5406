I have never been a Peter Sellers fan, so I may be biased, but I found this "original" version of Casino Royale to be the worst film I have ever seen.  For production values, as well as ridiculousness, it is on a par with "Towering Inferno," although TI wasn't intended to be comedic, so I have to rate that one even lower.

When I hear the word spoof, a film like "Airplane" comes to mind.  Or "The Brady Bunch Movie."  Both of those movies made me laugh to the point of tears, and I can watch them over and over and still get hearty laughs.  On the other hand, I don't think I got much more than a chuckle or two out of "Casino Royale."  I'm shocked that the latest "real" James Bond film used the same title - anything that draws attention to this sorry excuse for a movie can only be detrimental to the James Bond franchise.

Silliness is not a substitute for comedy writing.  And this picture overflows with silliness.  In fact, I'd put it on a par with the old "Batman" tv series of the 60s, which had the same level of bizarre silliness.  At least Batman had a likeable hero character in Adam West.  This movie just made me want to wretch.  There is nothing even remotely likeable about any of the characters.

I assume there are a few people who really like this film, and that's something I'll never comprehend, but they say the French love Jerry Lewis, so I guess there's no accounting for taste!
