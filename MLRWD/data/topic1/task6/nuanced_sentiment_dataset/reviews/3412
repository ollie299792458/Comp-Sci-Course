This workout is good for someone who is new to martial arts or Yoga.  It has some basic moves and poses for those disciplines.

Yoga:  The yoga poses are mostly strength and flexibility poses, relating to martial arts muscle groups (thighs, shoulders, and core).  Once done a few times, it is not very challenging.

Martial Arts:  This is a tae bo type of exercise routine.  It is very basic, and will not make your even break a sweat.

Meditation:  I am sure some people will think critically about this, but I skipped over this part most of the time.  I was looking for an endurance workout, and I found that a meditation was a huge break.  It was meant to be a cooldown in addition to being spiritual, but I found it to do neither effectively.  I didn't really give the spirituality a chance, in all fairness, but the cooldown was not effective since it was essentially an abrupt stop to the exercise.  To effectively cool down, you need moderate exercise.  It beings down your heart rate, allows your body to drain away excess lactic acid from a long workout.  Granted, since the workout does not really do much for you, a cooldown is not as needed.

For a while, I used this workout as a warmup for another MMA workout video.  It did its job well for a while, but the video is now shelved since I cross train with biking/running.

I have not tried the more advanced Budokon workout videos, as they are so expensive and I was a little shy about buying another in this series.  As an avid runner, Yoga should be a beneficial workout for my flexibility and leg strength so I may eventually give them a try.
