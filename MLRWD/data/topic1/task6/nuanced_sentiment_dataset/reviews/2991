Sorry to be the nay sayer here gang.But, this puppy's going out with the next trash pick-up.First off, can we talk MISCASTING here of Patrizia Ciofi? Like, come on--MARIA is meant to be a fun loving teenie bopper in a comical setting. Ciofi takes the hard edge approach; almost like something out of "Das Madchen in Uniform".Super man tenor himself, Juan Diego Florez, try as he might, can't keep this fiasco afloat. Even his stunning vocalese fire works display seemed dampened by this whole Titanic like voyage. But most siful, on the musical side, we're treated to sloppy ensemble; just can't even think of doing it with BEL CANTO; Maestro Riccardo Frizza mostly at fault--but hey, there's blame enough to go all around. Lastly, the overall production concept--of updating this piece--just doesn't hold water. Heck, even the principals and chorus on

stage don't seem convinced of the notion; so then, how are we expected

to by into this ill conceived premise. Oh, PS. One five star reviewer was so smitten by a "third act aria"--sorry, dude; but Mr. Donizetti only penned two acts to this opera.
