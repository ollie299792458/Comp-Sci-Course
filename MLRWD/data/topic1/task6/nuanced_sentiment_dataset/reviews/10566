I currently own both DVD versions of M.  The new special edition is a victim of WAAAAAAY too much edge enhancement in the remastering process in an effort to create the illusion of a sharper picture.  Everything about the new edition exhibites jaggy lines which ends up being a real distraction.  The video transfer was supposed to be better on the new version, but the reality is that its not.  If you want to witness a proper restoration, see the restored authorized edition of "Metropolis"...also view the special feature about the "Metropolis" restoration to see how restoration is done properly.  The other problem issue is the new subtitle translation.  In some cases its more accurate, in other cases, its less.  For instance at the end during the kangaroo court proceedings, there is no reference to the 'paragraph 51' defense, which is the German equivelant (at the time)to pleeding insanity today.  Its in the earlier Criterion edition, but not the new one.  If it wasn't for the added special features, I'd score it a 1 out of 5.  This is an insulting special edition for such an important piece of cinema.
