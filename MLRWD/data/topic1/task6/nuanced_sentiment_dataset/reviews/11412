Is this a thriller? Last time I checked thrillers were supposed to be exciting and keep you on the edge of your seat..

Tom Stall (Mortensen) is an average man married to they lovely Edie (Bello), father of two, working at a diner in a peaceful small town. One day two bandits passing through decide to rob Tom's diner, but their plan backfires as Tom kills them both and becomes hero overnight. Then enters Carl Fogerty (Harris); a mob guy who is convinced Tom Stall is in fact Joey from Philadelphia (an organized killer). He won't take no for an answer..

The movie begins with a dry scene where the bandits have just made a stop somewhere, then followed by an awkward sex scene between Tom and his wife. Things pick up quickly when the bandits enter the diner and things start to happen. The idea is original. Mortensen and Bello do a convincing job (Bello seems like she's cut out for the thriller genre). In between there's scenes with their son being bullied at school and you're wondering where the movie was going with that.

It's a good movie for about an hour. After that it seems like the creativity ended (and you will know what I'm talking about when you see it - and if you do; told you so).
