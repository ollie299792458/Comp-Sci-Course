"The Streets of San Francisco" was one of the best cop shows of the 1970s and its wonderful that it is finally available on DVD. The formula was similar to other cops shows, but seemed to have more realistic story lines. This release marks the first time the Pilot has been seen in many years. When the episodes re-air on TV, the pilot is usually not shown since it was 98 minutes long, so it was a definite treat to see how the show started and what made the show so interesting.

I think the reason that Karl Malden's Mike Stone and Michael Douglas' Steve Keller worked so well is because their characters were completely different - Stone was raised on the streets of San Francisco and Keller was a college educated cop, but yet they had one thing in common, the pursuit of justice. I think it also helped that Karl Malden knew Michael's father, legendary actor Kirk Douglas, since before Michael was born. The chemistry between the two actors was undeniable and you could tell they both had fun shooting together, which was made even more evident after Douglas left the series at the beginning of the shows final season and was replaced by actor Richard Hatch.

The colors and audio have been enhanced on this DVD and makes the show look even better than it originally aired back in the early 1970s on ABC. This show was well renowned for its ability to get major guest stars and even have stars who later became famous in their own right, years after appearing.

Also included are two special features. One features Douglas and Malden being interviewed on the set of the show by legendary interviewer Army Archerd before the show began airing in September 1972. The other is a 9 minute Pilot Presentation which summarizes what the show is about. Both are thoroughly entertaining and wonderful to see all these years later. All in all this DVD set is a wonderful trip back in time to the good ol days of partner crime drama.
