This was a good movie but it could have been so much better. I enjoyed this film and actually bought it because the story was so compelling. It was a movie I had looked forward to for months, having read the book and heard of Frank Abagnale's amazing story of deceipt and fraud arround the world while still a teenager. Amazingly, Speilburg and company flubbed it, spending entirely too much time on Abagnale's family dynamics and his parent's marital problems and not nearly enough time just telling the incredible story of this young man's adventures. There was so much fodder here for a wonderful movie that I was very surprised how average the end product was. Decaprio, for my money, never got the right balance of calculating intelligence and nerves of steel of the real Frank Abagnale. Decraprio's Abagnale was all luck and pluck. A casting of someone like Matt Damon would have been far better. The movie's greatest flaw was it's meandering into the fictional and distracting story line of Abagnale's parent's marriage. All said, this was still an entertaining movie with good actors and a talented director. It is just sad that since it is likely that this story will be told on film only once and has been a long time coming that it did not live up to it's potential.
