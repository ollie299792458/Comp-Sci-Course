This is one of my all-time favorite, if not favorite, television shows. I remember gobbling down my dinner every Thursday to watch the show at 7pm. I remember laughing until my stomach hurt when Cliff and the men were pregnant. I remember ahhh-ing when Olivia first came on screen and won the hearts of the family. I remember crying my eyes out when the last episode aired and Cliff and Clair danced off the screen. I was watching TV Land the other night with my 7 year old niece (I am 27 now) and she and I were just laughing and laughing at the show. It's as funny, if not funnier since I am grown and can appreciate the family that I had, now as it was then. My niece even asked me if this was a new show and I told her, "No it's not. I used to watch this show when I was your age." "Wow, it's really old," was her response.

This is back when TV was good and we didn't have the smut that is Rock of Love, Flavor of Love, the Bachelor, Family Guy, etc. You don't have to be crude, curse or insult others to be funny. I get sentimental when I think about this show because it was so much a part of my childhood. I was only 3 but I still remember the opening baseball sequence and Rudy crying out in bed sick when Cliff asked her what she wanted and she said, "Mommy!"

I love this item, it is truly a treasure.
