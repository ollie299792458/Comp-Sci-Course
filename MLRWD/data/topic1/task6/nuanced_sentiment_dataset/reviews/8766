Just a short review to mention that yes, in parts, this film is absolutely a gore hound's dream movie.  It has excellent and inventive kills, extreme gore and sharp pacing.  It was just a lot of fun and I agree it's better than the first one.

However it also has a few really bad moments too.  There's some awful dialog and attempts at humor that mar this otherwise great horror film.  It seems so out of place and completely falls flat.  I almost stopped watching because of this one male character.  It wasn't entertaining, it was annoying.  In order to enjoy or get lost in a good horror film you must love the characters.  Happily the second half of the film switches gears and drops the stupid "comedy" elements and makes us care about the remaining characters.

I also want to mention that this one has moments that reminded me of Texas Chainsaw Massacre's "dinner scene", but in a good way.

All around this is an entertaining horror movie than any fan of the genre shouldn't miss.  I just wish someone would re-edit this film to take about about 10 minutes worth of crap footage and it could possbily be a new horror classic!
