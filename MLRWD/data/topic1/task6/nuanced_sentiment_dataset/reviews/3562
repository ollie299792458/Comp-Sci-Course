I am close to granting »Best Laid Plans« starring mystically gorgeous Reese Witherspoon (a.o. »Cruel Intentions (Sexual Provocation)«) and in a big support act Josh Brolin (a.o. »Nightwatch«) four stars. 'Cause it is a  thrilling movie. Pretty thrilling in fact - althrough the movie, I couldn't  wait to see what would happen next (and it is extremely rare that I  consider a movie to be really thrilling!).
The story in »Best Laid Plans«  is one of the rare ones where you never really know how things are gonna  turn out next. Therefore, the movie could normally be recommended. BUT the  ending is too feverish and American.
And what is even worse: The whole  premise for the situation that sparks off the very story of »Best Laid  Plans« is one huge paradox!  An embarrassing and enormous mistake which  makes me skip the fourth star and even consider to take the third one away  too. OK, the viewer cannot realize this paradox before the movie takes an  unexpected turn towards the end - but the mistake is bad enogh.
The  thrill and the acting in »Best Laid Plans« however are worth watching.
