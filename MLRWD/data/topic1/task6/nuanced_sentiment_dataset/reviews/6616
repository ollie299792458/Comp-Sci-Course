Tom Cruise gives the impression these days that his mere appearance on a movie screen is enough to send shivers of delight through thousands of theatergoers (he may be right; Cruise has NEVER had a box office dud).
MI-2 lacks many of the elements that made the first film a lot of fun.  "Mission 1" had a convuluted plot that no one could follow, which almost added to the enjoyment; the plot for the second film is so thin it would barely fill an hour of the TV series; in fact it's hard to believe the screenwriter who gave us "Chinatown" was really responsible (though Robert Towne admits he came on the project AFTER the action scnes had been planned and written).
For MI-2, Cruise and his co-producer, Paula Wagner, enlist the talents of Hong Kong director, John Woo, who stages his action scenes with a balletic style, but Woo has no flair for non-action scenes, so the first hour of "MI-2" is paced slower than a Merchant Ivory romance.
Although, Cruise and the incredible gorgeous Thandie Newton, make a couple that could grace the cover of any issue of GQ, they ignite no sparks on the screen, and as a villian, the talented Dougray Scott can do no more with his role than pretend to look menacing.
Cruise was smart to get involved with the "Mission" franchise, it gives him the financial clout to take on riskier projects such as "Eyes Wide Shut" and "Vanilla Sky," but with MI-2, he's produced an action film for people who hate action films.
DVD package is exceptional...picture and sound quality are excellent and many bonus features include two documentaries; behind the scenes look at many of the action sequences; and the hilarious MTV "Mission Improbable" satire featuring Ben Stiller as Tom CROOZE..
