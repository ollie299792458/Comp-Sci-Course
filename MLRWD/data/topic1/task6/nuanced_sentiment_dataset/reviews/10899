I did not read any reviews of this film before I watched, pardon me, started to watch this film. And it seems I didn't read any reviews before I bought it, either. Had I done so I would have thought twice about buying it.

So I settle down happily, all expectant, for I am a student in a screenwriting class myself and we know how hard it is to write something that will actually be put to screen, something that enthralls, that moves, that stirs people, something new and remarkable.

Well, first rule is, always show action for a reason. Make it lead somewhere, every single shot. Add dialogue for emphasis, to enhance the story. To help you out when you can't show something or don't want to. Rule two: make every character credible. Give them a function. Make them come alive, memorable.

First thing I notice when I watch the opening scene, how badly it is acted, but this is only the start and I am forgiving. Then I hear the dialogue and I think this better be good soon and start to play with my cat. When it doesn't I get curious and check out Leo Fitzpatrick. Can't find anything wrong with him, healthy boy he his (and good in the film Kids) and I think why do you use a real African American but can't use a real person with cerebral palsy. Mhhhh. Just to make a point in a seemingly shocking film.

Anyway, then it quickly deteriorates to the point that I stop and check how many people think the same and check it out on amazon sites in various countries. It emerges that the European sites have nothing but praise for the film and I am incredulous. The American one has got a good number of warnings. Let me add mine.
