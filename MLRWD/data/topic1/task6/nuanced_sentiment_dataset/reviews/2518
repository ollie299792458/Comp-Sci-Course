Tomorrow Never Dies only improves on GoldenEye in the John Woo-meets-Bond choreography of the action scenes. Whoever says Brosnan lacks personality mistakes subtlety (Fleming's Bond had this in bunches) for blandness. The  plot is muddled, convoluted, and far-fetched at best, but then again, some  of the best Bonds also suffer from this (Dr. No, You Only Live Twice, Spy  Who Loved Me, and The Living Daylights come to mind...) The dialogue is as  witty as ever, Moneypenny's description of Bond as a "cunning linguist  foremost amongst all the double entendre. Jonathan Pryce is somewhat  wasted, as is his henchman, whose name I don't remember, but who should be  known as "Red Grant, Part 10". The girls sizzle, though Teri  Hatcher's torch for Bond seems pathetic, given his poligamist tendencies...  The intros are still spectacular, computer technology carrying over from  Maurice Pinder's artistry... Very good, but third banana in Brosnan's opus  to GoldenEye and The World is Not Enough, which have better plots, more  memorable characters, and better flow and editing (though Tomorrow is  actually shorter!) Cubby Broccoli should sleep tight up there in Movie  Heaven... Bond is alive and well into the 21st Century, with nary a  wrinkle...!
