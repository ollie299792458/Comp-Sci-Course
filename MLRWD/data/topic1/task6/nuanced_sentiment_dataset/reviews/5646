....sorry, but I didn't get the point....so the honest small guy decided to throw in a lie to help out the liar, upon which the sophisticated lair confessed to be the real idiot....then the small guy picked up the phone, the lie was exposed and so he became the idiot again....?
So who's the idiot? I'm sure it isn't you...all the 5 stars are making sure of that :)
I guess I'm just gonna be myself and appeal for us idiots.
I used to live in Europe, watching this movie made me more thankful I don't have to live in Europe anymore....a very good movie in revealing the corruption of european society or the idiocy of the upper class....the slap-sticks are lame and truly idiotic....my 11 y/o kept on laughing about the...carousel...joke. Really.....it being a FRENCH MOVIE makes people excuse the obscurity of real humor. Somebody compared it to Peter Sellers comedies....I have all of his films, none can be compared to this garbage.
As far as gender, it should be in the mockery section.....
ps. so what about the wife, the girlfriend or the inspector? Do I have to write the script for that? :))

This is the 11 y/o's review:
This Movie is Hilarious. I was laughing on full power as I watched the little guy making mistakes like putting alcohol in the eggs...
Or never left the other guy alone and always tried to help him.
This was even funnier than my other kid's movies like Cats and Dogs or Furry Vengeance.
I guess for adult's it's stupid, but for kid's it's Funny.
The ending was a bit sad, But it still was a brilliant movie.
The best Comedy.
