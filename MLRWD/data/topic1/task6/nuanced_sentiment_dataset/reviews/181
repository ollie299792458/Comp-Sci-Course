Good Lord! I had no idea a fantasy film could be this bad...Usually your run-of-the-mill fantasy film is average at its worst, but now this film has lowered the bar all the way to hell...First off, with a pedigree as established as D&D, you'd think that someone involved with this project would have taken it at least a little seriously...But Nooooo...We get this pedantic pile of smarmy ......This could have been a great warm-up to the Lord Of The Rings trilogy if it had been done right...But it wasn't, of course...I could write on and on about how awful it really was but I'll just make it as quick as possible...Marlon Wayans, who is usually talented, seems to have had one huge brain-fart throughout this whole movie, making terrible jokes and one-liners that are 100% cringe-worthy. The villains were semi-cool, but not enough to save the film; there is also an attempt at a stirring climax involving swarms of dragons battling amongst our heroes and villains, but its execution ends up more silly than exciting. So, the main problems with this mess are that no one involved wanted to even try to take the source material seriously and also, the script and acting are both horrendous and below z-grade quality. Avoid this one like the proverbial plague unless you have a death wish.
