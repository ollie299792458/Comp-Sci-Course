I am hearing impaired and I contacted Warner Brothers to find out if Season 8 box set had English subtitles.  They replied: no English subtitles on the Season 8 box set released in the United States.  They did this once before on another season.  They made the general public angry as subtitles for other languages were included on the DVDs released in the United States. Americans had to go to another region (country) to get/buy a version with English subtitles.

Warner Brothers, one of the most prestigious movie studios in the world,  should be ashamed to release a DVD and/or a DVD Box set in the United States that deliberately excludes a segment of the American viewing public; i.e. the hearing impaired.. I also know there are people who watch DVDs with the subtitles on in order to fully enjoy and understand the dialogue even though they are not hearing impaired.

I wish that that all viewers of Warner Brother products would convey the public's displeasure to Warner Brother's upper management.  Shame.  Shame.
