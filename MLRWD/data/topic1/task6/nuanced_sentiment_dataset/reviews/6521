My bias...

Loves: Action movies.
Likes: Tom Hardy
Dislikes: Most romantic comedies
Hates: Reese Witherspoon

I went into this movie with low expectations.  First off, it's got Reese Witherspoon, who I can't stand.  She's annoying, smarmy and unattractive.  Second, it's directed by McG, who for my tastes, misses in theaters (the Charlie's Angels series, Terminator Salvation).  That being said, I know McG has the potential to entertain me, having produced one of my favorite TV shows of all time, the guilty pleasure known as Fastlane.  My expectations were checked at the door.

Chris Pine and Tom Hardy play off of each other quite well.  Tom Hardy I bought as a CIA agent, in terms of attitude and build.  Pine, not as much.  Reese Witherspoon is just kind of...there...as the love interest.  The story is fairly cookie-cutter like one may expect going in...two CIA agents accidentally kill a bad guy.  That bad guy's brother lives, and plots revenge.  In the meantime, the two CIA agents start dating the same girl, causing friction in their relationship.  The story is nothing new, but is adequate.

They are marketing this movie as an action/romantic comedy.  The action in the movie is done very poorly - mostly quick cuts and off screen bullet wounds (for examples of how action scenes should be shot, see Haywire).  The action set pieces are few and short.  There are a few laughs, although the severely over the top character Chelsea Handler plays gets old quick.  The ending of the movie is quite ridiculous, and makes little sense...sadly, I saw what was going to happen about a mile away, so if you see a lot of movies, you can see where the movie is heading.

I don't regret seeing this movie, but I probably won't watch it again.  The action isn't gratifying enough and the comedy isn't funny enough.  You will forget about this movie within 24 hours of seeing it.

Score: 2 stars.
