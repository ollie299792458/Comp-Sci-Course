I will warn you first that I watched this movie only *after* reading the book, and I suppose that almost definitely clouds my judgement to some degree.
Having said that, this movie is a purely super-superficial scratching of the hints of the surface of the memoirs of Reinaldo Arenas, almost completely devoid of any of the power and richness of the book.  My wife, who had not read "Before Night Falls" watched with me, and her comment was, "Why should I care about this guy?"  Based soley on the film, it was a fair question.
The movie shows Arenas in a light that has the interesting effect of making him seem "better" and "worse" than he really was.  Both the ravenous (and occasionally paedophilic) sexual appetite of the man is missing from the movie, as is a fair and moving depiction of the miserable hardship and persecution he suffered through.  The strengths of the book are completely wasted here, as the vivid picture Arenas painted of the homosexual community in 1950s and 1960s Havana is barely touched on, and the political repression going on at the time is only hinted at.  Additionally, as far as an accurate portrayal of a life, so many things are added and omitted as to make the movie virtually unreconizable as a cinematic depiction of Arenas' memoirs.
So, what is left is an overlong movie full of undeveloped characters whose connections with each other are unclear, and a plot that you kinda-sorta are able to follow, but the sum total is "Who cares?"  I do have to give kudos to Javier Bardem, however, for a fine performance, doing the very best with the little he had to work with.
It's all unfortunate, because it was a really deep, impressive book...I suggest you drop the dollars for that and don't waste your time on this film.
