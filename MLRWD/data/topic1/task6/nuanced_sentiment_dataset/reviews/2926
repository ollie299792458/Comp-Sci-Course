This movie is beautiful and the DVD is worth it just for the movie itself but the two reasons why I got this Special edition are pretty disappointing. The Documentary about haw was made is pretty bad most of the interviews are not to actors in the film or DP or executive producers are two movie critics from Hollywood and some footage of Tornatore, the director, no saying much or anything interesting. Also the DVD contain the director's cut version. Already happen with me more than once. The theatrical releases are much better than the directors cuts. The movie add unnecessary scenes and a full explanation of what happen between Elena and Toto that does not bring anything important to the movie.
I will yes confess that some extra footage explain little details that originally didn't make much sense and with the extra footage does it but does not change much the movie.
Anyway I give to the DVD 4 stars because the movie is great no matter what so if you didn't see it buy the DVD because you will watch this movie more than once
