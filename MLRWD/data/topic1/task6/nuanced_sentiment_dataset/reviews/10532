Wife's life in jeopardy, action focused on one location, only one man for the job ... sound familiar? Yes! John McClane is back. Some will correctly rename the film Die Hard 3 1/2. My choice would be Die Easy.

This time JM, in the persona of Jeff Talley, simply must overcome three misguided lads to obtain the key that unlocks the (once again estranged) love(s) of his life. No international terrorists, no rogue militaries ... three 18-20 somethings. Die Easy.

The Get Over Yourself Award goes to:

Director Florent Siri for his The Passion of the (Anti)Christ inferno.

Runner Up:

Composer Larry Fulton for his (l)imitation of John Williams.

Most Over Her Head Award goes to:

Rumor Willis for her take-your-daughter-to-work contribution.

Most Under His Head Award goes to:

Kevin Pollack for his lay-down act during most of the film.

Determined to Make the Most of the Role Award goes to:

Ben Foster for his six feet over the top performance.

Most Misscast Award goes to:

Michelle Horn for her 18-year-old-playing-a-14-year-old attempt. (Story would have worked better if Ms. Horn acted her age.)

and finally, Most Surprising Role goes to:

Jimmy Bennett for knowing that at least 2 versions of Heaven Can Wait were made ... and they both are available on DVD.

So go ... have fun ... Die Hard 4 will be here before you know it
