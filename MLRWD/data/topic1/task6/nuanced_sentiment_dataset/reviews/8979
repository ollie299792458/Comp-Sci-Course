I have read Spark's book, "A Walk To Remember" which was extremely sweet and touching. But as usual I had doubts about the movie released upon the same name staring Shane West and Mandy Moore. Landon Carter (West) is the popular high school bad boy. He is punished after commiting a dangerous stunt and forced to join the school play and comes upon Jamie Sullivan (Moore) the girl who has been in all of his classes for years and has been the target of pranks and put-downs for much of her life. She is also the local preacher's (Peter Coyote) daughter. At first, he is resentful of her coming up to him, but he soon finds himself asking her for help with his lines in the play.

Landon soon falls hopelessly in love with Jamie (don't blame him), something he thought impossible. As you watch their relationship blossom throughout the movie, your own feelings are inextricably linked and you find yourself cheering the couple on, marveling at their sweet times spent together and secretly envious of the intense love that they have discovered. Jamie is so incredibly pure and unselfish that she had my heart fluttering by the end of the movie.

The movie benefits greatly from its two talented leads, Moore and West, who prove their acting worth with great performances. Moore lends her character a huge amount of depth and surrounds her with an innocent, heartwarming aura, so much so that by the end of the movie, she can do no wrong. This movie isn't like other teen movies, it has a heart and it's ending will no doubt bring you to tears.
