This is the movie that was not. The movie that was rumored to be great. Then it was rumored dead. Then it was rumored that they might salvage it and release it straight to video. Well, two of those rumors ended up being true. The project did pretty much die. Bob and David sensed it was going down hill. Moreover, the film did find its way to video/DVD. Bob and David had washed their hands of the project completely, actually enocuraging their fans not to buy it. However, Troy Miller was intent on seeing it put out there. Well, if you are a Mr. Show fanatic (and I am), you just can't get enough of them. They are comedic geniuses and the Ronny Dobbs skit was perhaps their greatest skit of all-time (and that is saying something). So, you just can't resist buying it. I bought it! I laughed a couple of times. I thought Odenkirk was wasted and Cross was too tame. I would have liked to have seen other Mr. Show talents used more. What I am trying to say is that it was not that great. OK? I don't want to speak ill of the boys, but you know what I am saying.
