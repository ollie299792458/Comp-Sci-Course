I have purchased this DVD because it had such rave reviews. I'd have to say that I'm extremely disappointed in this purchase.

I find the instruction is poor and un-clear. There is no mention of an inhale before chanting ohm, no proper warm-up is included before you start getting into some serious stretches. There are no alternate routines for those who are not flexible. The voice of the instructor sounds more like she is trying to seduce you, rather than to give instruction. Yoga instruction should allow you to close your eyes and follow the routine and this DVD does not allow that. All you are given is an attractive woman in tight clothes performing an advanced stretching routine. If that was the intention, than you've succeeded. Perhaps I will play this at my next party with no sound;) Are the spiritual benefits of yoga even considered? Personally, I say they are not, which goes against everything yoga stands for. If that is the intention, than why not do something that is for strictly physical benefits such as pilates or weight training?

Thanks for trying to westernize something, but I think you missed the point.

I would recommend any of the Sampoorna Yoga DVDs over this one (especially if your looking for something authentic). When practicing from those DVDs you actually feel that you are in the presence of great wisdom, strength, and above all spirituality.
