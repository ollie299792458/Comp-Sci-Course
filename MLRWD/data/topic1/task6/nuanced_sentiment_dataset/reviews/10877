I grew up on Quantum Leap, and remember sitting next to my mom every week to watch Sam and Al leap from time-place to time-place; their adventures always riddled with action, adventure, hilarity, sadness, and (this accredidation goes to not only the actors and writers, but to everyone else involved with the Q.L projects) pure genius.

This one tv series in particular holds a special place near and dear to my heart, for not only could the actors treat their parts with a form of dignity and grace, they could also have fun with it as well (the one episode that comes to my mind when saying this is "Good Morning, Peoria", in Season 2, where Sam leaps into the local DJ and takes the part like a certain other DJ in "that one movie").  Scott Bakula could bring to life the characters he portrayed, and brought a sense of realism to the show.  As a kid, I had that certain dream of being able to change what had happened in the past, and Sam Beckett made that dream a sort of reality.

I recommend this show to anyone that has either never seen it, or just hadn't had the time to sit down and fully enjoy the show completely.  The show was spectacular 15 years ago, and to this day, I don't think another show could compare to the dynamics this show brought to television.
