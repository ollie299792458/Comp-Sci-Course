I had many mixed reactions about this film, but one thing I can say for sure, is that it was designed to simply make money, and not to put on a serious WW2 submarine movie.  Not even coming close to competing with the internationally acclamined movie Das Boot, this movie should be simply watched and admired for its good computer animated special effects.  Not to mention that this film was incredibly unrealistic when it came to effectively showing submarine combat in World War Two, I give you two examples from the film. Number one, there was no submarine to submarine combat in World War Two, the torpedoes on board German U-boats and American submarines alike did not have any lock-on devices, since that technology did not exist at the time, (Duh)the torpedoes, when fired, would simply continue in a straight line of fire until they either exploded accidentally or slammed into the sea-floor.  So, in that respect, it would be imposible to fire at another submarine that was traveling in the same direction moving fast, and not having any modern sonar or target aquisition technology on the torpedoes.  That is why submarines where mainly used in World War Two for the destruction of enemy convoys, which the Germans where quite good at.  The second example is towards the end of the film, when the Americans launch another torpedo at the bow of a German destroyer.  The destroyer mysteriously explodes in a ripple effect.  How could a destroyer suddenly ignite into a thousand pieces from being hit being hit in the bow.  Unless that's the place where the crew kept there secret stash of Chinese fire crackers?  Anyway, that was just plain dumb.  This is no Das Boot.
