While I enjoyed the movie overall, I felt that it contained many negatives which took away from the overall enjoyment. The DVD is not rated but should be a Mature or an R for nudity and language. What I hoped to be another great western for the family to enjoy turned into an "OMG get the kids out of here" from the time I hit play.
It felt like they were trying to stretch out the movie by injecting subplots and majestic scenes instead of building on the main plot
Way to much foul language: I understand that such language is and has been around forever, but it should have been toned down in the movie.
Nudity: What occurred to the women could have been conveyed without the graphic scenes in the movie. While it did happen why show it in the manner they did? Ever heard of taste?
To many plot distractions: The plague carrier, the madam who bought the Chinese girls, the bad guy who was sent to pick up the Chinese girls. The therapeutic paper scene; Come on, is TP that exciting?
While I am in no way a prude and never want to see government censors dictating morals to the film industry.  I find the modern trend in graphic sex, language, and violence portrayed in the film industry disappointing.  I enjoy a good shoot-em up flick packed with action, blood and guts as much as the next person, but do you have to say the F word 5 times in a sentence. Do you have to show tasteless sex scenes? Do you need to show the torturous dismemberment of someone? Why is it so difficult to make a quality film now days?  Maybe that's why there are so many remakes of old film coming out of Hollywood. Is the well dry? Is the talent of modern actors so limited that the audience must be distracted? BLAH BLAH BLAH.... I've said my piece.
