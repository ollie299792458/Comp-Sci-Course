Let me cut to the chase here, this movie is a drag in every sense. If you watched Fatal Attraction and liked it then skip this one without further thinking. Besides being a lousy copy of the 80s classic this movie is SO CHEESY so so so bad that will let you wondering how some of these directors (and screenwriters) even get funds to produce such disasters.

The director is clearly a guy that knows his craft shooting commercials, everything is peach perfect, all the illumination and the acting resembles the happy family from the tooth paste commercial, it is so CLICHE it hurts!

The plot is so bad, you can see what's coming next from a mile away, I figured out the ending 20 minutes before it happened! Every scene sequence has been copied from somewhere else because it all seems too familiar to be original.

The music is so tacky, even when disaster looms or somebody dies you have the freaking R&B sung by Mrs Knowles, I mean the soundtrack must be the entire purpose of this film. As an actress Knowles shows she's a great singer.

I could go on forever on this one, just stick to the beginning of my review,  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE. Oh well....perhaps you wanna laugh some then go for it.
