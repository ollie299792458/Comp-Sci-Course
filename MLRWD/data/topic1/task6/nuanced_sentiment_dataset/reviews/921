A TV news reporter played by Lauren Tewes, tries to protect a Miami community and her blind, deaf daughter (gripping performance Jennifer Jason Leigh) from a ruthless killer who stalks only at night and goes along his usual, normal routine by day.

The deaths scenes are realistic, not over the top, and the performances by the entire cast, especially lead actress, Lauren Tewes, will keep you hooked until the final credits. The night scenes, featuring the vulnerable female victims, either walking the streets alone, or while at work, are atmospheric and creepy. You might find yourself yelling back at the TV a few times while they make a few clumsy choices to et away from the killer (answering the phone, having a conversation with the killer, etc).

And mid-way through the movie, when the reporter gets herself in a jamb inside the killer's apartment, the real suspense begins. If you like B movies with a clever script and a freaky psychopath, then the hour and twenty minute "Eyes of a Stranger" is for you. Nerve-jarring and scary.
