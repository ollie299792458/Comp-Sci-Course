I'm sure that somewhere, George Romero discusses or explains why it took him 20 years to get back to a franchise that has never suffered from lack of fans.  It may be that he simply wanted to do something else with his life, or it could be that he was afraid he could never top the success of his previous films.  Even if it isn't the primary reason, I'll always wonder if fear of competing with himself didn't play at least a tiny part.  That, and dealing with people's expectations.

What's interesting to me is that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005B1YC">Night of the Living Dead</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IQNAG">Dawn of the Dead</a>, which I consider his best, are as different as night and, well, dawn I guess, even though both are dealing with zombies.  Almost unbelieveably, in retrospect, Romero was able to make frightening films and social points at the same time.  The point is that he set the bar incredibly high with those two, and I think we fans expect each new installment to top the last.  I'm not sure that's possible, since a large part of the first two movie's success were simply because they came out of nowhere.  They were complete surprises.

I like every movie I've seen of Romero's, some just better than others.  Land Of The Dead has its moments, but it certainly seems less than average compared to the first two 'Dead' films.  I don't even think its as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008G8L9">Day of the Dead</a>, other than in its star power and production value.  The idea that the zombies are beginning to acquire a smattering of intelligence, and, in very rudimentary ways, begin to show emotions such as empathy and pity for their fellow undead doesn't seem logical given the premise of the films, nor does it seem to serve any larger commentary on our own society.  It really seems more like a Deus ex Machina in order to bring the remaining humans, forced to live in a guarded compound, into conflict with the undead and at the same time upset the new social structure that has developed since the fall of civilization.

That new social structure DOES seem to be Romero's overall point; a commentary about the elite (as represented by Dennis Hopper), and the commoners (Leguizamo and Baker).  Even that is strained though - Hopper and his power partners are in place because of the amount of money they have, but given the parameters of the movie, would paper money really have that sort of power?

I think there are a lot of problems like these that plague this movie, but, on the other hand, it's still a pretty good zombie film.  All the requisite effects and shocks are present.  I just don't think that there is any technique or story innovation that any director can spring on us that is going to top Romero's first two efforts or Lucio Fulci's masterpiece <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060GUV2K">Zombie</a>.  We may get films that come close or that are still entertaining, but, sadly, without essentially changing the genre into something else, we're going to be left with pale imitations.  And that may very well be why Romero left the subject alone for as long as he did.
