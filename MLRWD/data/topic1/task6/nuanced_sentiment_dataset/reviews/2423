I have no idea how many times I have watched "The Whole Nine Yards".  It remains one movie that I can watch over and over again, laughing each and every time I see it (yes often in the same places).

Matthew Perry is outstanding as steals the show as the awkward dentist Nicholas 'Oz' Oseransky.  Amanda Peet is hilarious as Jill St. Claire, the wannabe side kick of contract killer Jimmie `The Tulip' Tudeski, played by Bruce Willis. I've always liked Michael Clark Duncan and he is great fun to watch as Franklin `Frankie Figs' Figueroa.  Natasha Henstridge as Cynthia Tudeski is beautiful, as always.  Kevin Pollock is great as Janni Pytor Gogalak.  One draw back might be the fake French accent of Rosanna Arquette as Sophie Oseransky.

 If you are looking for a comedy with some great plot twists, a little action, and maybe a contract assassination thrown in, then I highly recommend giving the movie a look.  While the "The Whole Ten Yards" is good sequel to this movie, "The Whole Nine Yards" is the better of the two.
