I saw on TCM a "making of" special about this film, and it looked interesting. And I've always liked van Gogh's artwork. So I decided to give this a try.

Now to understand how much I enjoyed this film, you have to understand how I normally "watch" movies: with my nose buried in my computer, writing software or fiction. Once in a while I look up for an exciting scene, but mostly I listen to the film in the background.

Not far into "Lust for Life", I put down the computer. Then I turned off the room light, so I could get a clearer picture. This was one film I truly WATCHED. The director did a phenomenal job of putting van Gogh's work into the context of the real places where he worked. He even hired locals for many of the lesser roles. The movie made me feel like I was there, and gave me a new appreciation for works I had long enjoyed.

And once the film caught my attention, it spoke to me. I'm in two creative fields, and I've experienced times where the work just took over my mind. The more I worked, the more the ideas drove me to even more ambitious ideas, almost like a feedback loop. It's hard for me even to describe; but Kirk Douglas in this film captured that feeling exactly, and I really identified with the man. At the same time, in van Gogh's case this drive took over his life; and the result was tragic (and a little ominous).

Since then, I've researched the real story. The film isn't 100% historically accurate. It's a little sanitized and a little dramatized. But the differences are small, and inconsequential.

Finally, I have to note the excellent performance of Anthony Quinn as Gauguin (sp?). I honestly couldn't recognize him in this role. I'm more familiar with his later roles, where it seemed like directors hired him to play Anthony Quinn, kindly wise old man. This film made me realize I've missed some of his best work. He really became the character for me.
