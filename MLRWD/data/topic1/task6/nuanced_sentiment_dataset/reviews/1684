I have good things to say, and a few minor complaints I'm willing to put out there, about Gunga Din.

Yes, this film is fun, rousing, loveable adventure that easily sets the standard for what a good afternoon at the movies is all about, and it has at its core a positive message about friendship and living life to the hilt. I recently rented the VHS and was reminded of why this movie was one of my favorites as a kid: it's just great.

But I am willing to acknowledge the problems: there is, indeed, a subtle undercurrent of racism that can make the movie a little uncomfortable at times, but I am convinced there is no mean-spirited intent to any of it. It simply cropped up in the narrative as an unexamined, reflexive thinking pattern many people had in those days. Don't forget, in the film's background are many Indian soldiers presented as brave and dignified men.

I also acknowledge the film does not look with a critical eye at the British rule of India: the film dodges the whole issue by having the villians be a cult of sadistic killers rather than political rebels. Yet again, I think that was simply a failure to examine one's one thinking habits rather than any mean or patronizing attitude towards others. I think the film makers were NOT touting an unseemly worldview: they were just not paying attention to some assumptions that seeped into their movie.

Finally, notice how the lead bad guy, Eduardo Cianelli's guru (in a superb performance) is WAY smarter and more charismatic that our heroes. It's amazing the heroes got the better of the guru's followers.

But those complaints aside, Gunga Din is still one of my favorites; smart-alecky buddies, nasty bad guys, fast action, and breezy heroics. What more could you ask for from a popcorn flick?
