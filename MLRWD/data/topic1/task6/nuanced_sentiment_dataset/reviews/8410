Looper is one of the best films I've seen this year. Maybe just right behind The Dark Knight Rises.

Loopers are basically for hire thugs who kill people sent back 30 years by mobsters, since in the future bodies are tagged and can't be desposed of without detection. Then Loopers start getting sent back future version of themselves when they are no longer needed. Let's just say one future Looper remembered what he did 30 years ago to himself and escapes his execution.

Joseph Gorden-Levitt turns in a truly memorable lead performance as a young version of the character played by Bruce Willis, who is back in fine form here. Emily Blunt is great too and the child actor who plays her son knocks it out of the park. He goes from funny to scary and back again.

It has some minor flaws and time travel is always confusing to totally figure out, but the acting, writing and story are fantastic.

Also check out Timecrimes. It came out in 2007 and you have to read subtitles (the dubbing is terrible) but it is a very smart movie that takes many views to put it all together. Or you can be lazy like me and just read all the online theories afterwards.
