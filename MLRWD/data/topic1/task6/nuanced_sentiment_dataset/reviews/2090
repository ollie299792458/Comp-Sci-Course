For fans of Sondheim, this DVD is a 'must-have'. Aside from a melancholy and captivating plot, this 52-minute, one-act play is satisfying and interesting in a number of ways. On one level, it's a black and white time capsule that takes us back to the 1960's. Additionally, it serves as a cautionary tale regarding TV: what it once was and what it might have become.

But the primary and most satisfying reason for owning this DVD is that it contains the early work of Sondheim. There are four songs, 'If You Can Find Me I'm Here', 'I Remember(Snow)', 'When' and 'Take Me To The World', sung by Anthony Perkins (Charles) and Charmian Carr (Ella). These same four songs are also performed on the following CD's: "The Frogs/Evening Primrose" (Theresa McCarthy & Neil Patrick Harris), "Sondheim At The Movies" (Liz Callaway & Gary Beach) and "Dress Casual" (Bernadette Peters & Mandy Patinkin). Each is wonderful and each is slightly different from the others. Fans of Sondheim will likely buy all of them which is probably the most reasonable path to take.

So my advice is: don't delay. Buy the "Evening Primrose" DVD. In addition to the performance, it also contains about 80 minutes of interviews and other features. Musically and theatrically, this intriguing fantasy is a most worthwhile purchase.
