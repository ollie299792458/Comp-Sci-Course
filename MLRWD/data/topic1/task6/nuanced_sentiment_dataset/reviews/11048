A fan of the comic book version since it surfaced in the late 80's (see my quote in issue #7!), I've been waiting for this film version for about a decade.  Die hard fans of the comic book series will find a lot to like in this movie but, unfortunately, you'll probably be irritated with a lot of things, too.  I understood beforehand that to do FAUST in a manner that truly reflects the spirit of its creators, it needed to be rated XXX -- or something beyond that!  Nevertheless, while shooting for the 'R' rating, opportunities to make this a better movie were missed.  Starting my list of gripes is the beautiful actress they got to play Jade DeCamp doesn't get naked ONCE in this film!  During the ritual scene, Jade begins to have sex ... completely clothed!  This is FAUST I'm watching, right?  It just made no sense, especially since so many other characters are nude at some point in this film.  There were the makeup and continuity errors -- Jade is viciously tortured by Claire in one scene... or so you'd think!  The next time you see Jade she has a few dabs of blood on her back.  By the following scene, she has miraculously recovered from her ordeal entirely!  The topper has to be earlier in the film, when M tells Jaspers that sleep will become a distant memory for him when he accepts his powers.  Later on, Jade is lured from Jasper's apartment by the villian -- while Jaspers is asleep!  Although those things drove me nuts, I forgave this movie and everyone involved once I heard Jaspers say, "What's the matter?  Don't you like my art?"  Yes, this could've been better -- but even as it is, it STILL tops The Crow 2:City of Angels and the last two Batman flicks!
