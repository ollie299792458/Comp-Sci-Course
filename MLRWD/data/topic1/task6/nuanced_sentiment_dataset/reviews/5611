I bought this movie as my girlfriend whom I start to love so much has experienced a very similar tragedy. As we both started watching and only me knowing the plot, it was quite emotional. As the movie progressed it was hard to understand the emotions and the actual meaning of often very deep hidden messages. We found ourselves a bit bored during the 2nd half of the movie as we couln't understand the subtle signs and clues given in the movie. Athough the use of cinematographical effects/angles and sounds is no doubt excellent, I only got the full understanding of this and the plot after watching it a 2nd time with the narration voice. This made the movie much more meaningfull.
I believe the movie could have been better if not so much of the original screenplay was omited and more time was spend on dialogue of the characters, this would make the movie 2 or 2.5 hours long.
Right now, I've fully enjoyed the movie after watching the 2 seperate audio tracks and will watch a 3rd time with the original.
Still believe it was an great movie! Just doesn't get a 5 star rating cause I think sense and emotion must be captured in a single viewing for it to be an excellent movie.
