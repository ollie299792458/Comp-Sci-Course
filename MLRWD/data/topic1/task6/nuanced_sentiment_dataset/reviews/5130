The art direction and initial premise of "Franklyn" was certainly compelling enough to capture my attention as well as my imagination... typically, I love these kinds of movies.  The acting and dialog carry the film well enough, but the scope of the production values is not enough to turn this narrowly focused Freudian psycho-drama into the epic it wants to be.  I found it to be a small story told in the context of a needlessly large, and subsequently distracting, setting.  Additionally, the characters weren't endearing enough to merit my sympathies or admiration.  Franklyn himself ended up confusing me more than enlightening or inspiring so the ending rang hollow for me,  I honestly couldn't muster enough caring to be left with any sense of wonder or loss.

The movie "V for Vendetta" makes a good corollary as it takes all these elements and combines them effectively into an epic ride.  If Franklyn had a message as large as it's ambitious effort it would have been far more satisfying.
