Fifth movie in the boxset. I actually like this movie. A childhood favorite. Granted that it still has it's flaws. My friend says the reason this movie gets blasted all the time is because he thinks this was made mainly to exploit Jamie Lee Curtis' career, since she had been in movies like Halloween and The Fog.

The movie starts off in 1974. A group of kids are playing hide-and-go-seek in an old school building when all of a sudden, one of the kids falls to their death. The other kids vow to keep quite about it, but one of the kids knows. Flash foward 6 years later, the kids are now in High School. On the night of their senior prom. What they don't know is that a masked killer is stalking them. The main problem with this film (which is the REAL reason why so many people hate it) is because of how long it takes to get to the killings, which don't happen until the last minute (Bad move there, I'm afraid), and the kills aren't even close to perfect, but enough about that.

Overall, there were some parts that creeped me out, some parts that bored me, and some parts that made me laugh, especially the scene where one of the girls mooned the nerdy janitor. Another one is of course, the cheezy disco music. So if you're a horror fan who has a lot of paticience and likes cheezy slashers, this is for you.

And on the topic of the remake, just forget about that. It was so awful, it's hard to believe it ended up #1 at the box office. The power of horror, I suppose.
