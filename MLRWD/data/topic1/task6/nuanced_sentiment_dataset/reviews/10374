"A Double Life" presents a challenge to viewers (and reviewers). The basic theme explores the theory that a stage actor can carry his role into his off stage life-to the detriment of himself or others. As the story unfolds, leading man Ronald Colman is playing in a Broadway production of Shakespeare's "Othello".  A murder takes place at its' climax. Without question, those who appreciate that literary work will enjoy the early part of "A Double Life" far more than those who have not.  The movie fast-forwards as a waitress (a very young Shelly Winters) is murdered in "real life". The police investigation is stymied until Colman does something very stupid! This reviewer won't reveal what that was- or the ending- but DL switches to a quite credible murder investigation. The result is that DL is two movies in one, with the second half far superior to the mellow dramatic first. Somebody whose opinion mattered must have liked DL since George Cukor was nominated for Best Director and Mr. Colman won the Best Actor Oscar. There is also excellent supporting work by Edmund O' Brien as a publicity man and Millard Mitchell as a cynical reporter. This reviewer is more cautionary. Even the great Colman is hard pressed to shine in a two movies in one scenario. One wonders if his DL Oscar was truly awarded for past work such as "The Prisoner of Zenda" or "Random Harvest" and not this more mundane release.  DL is NOT the movie to watch Ronald Colman for the first time!
