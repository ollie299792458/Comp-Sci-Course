This movie along with the first one, "Romancing the Stone"

are just not very good movies.

When a movie gets you to say (quote) "what the **** is going on here?" then something has got to be wrong with it.

This one was better for me than the first one, but still kind of stupid. At least there was an F16 aircraft in this one, but that doesn't make the movie.

 If you are used to the Real Indiana Jones movies then this an insult to filmmaking. I just hated the first one, "Romancing the Stone",  Just every minute of watching was like "oh come on!" unbelieveably stupid things happening for no reason, like when they accidentally just find a jewel wrapped in a paper tin foil in a stream, and they kind of wipe themselves with it. (they almost wipe their asses with it,)

 There was a bunch of mud on the jewel, oh my goodness, could this film be made any worse? Danny devito is like right behind them, he just takes it away from them and smiles.... Terrible!@ I just can't have this film in my video collection, but I can't give it to anyone like a friend of mine because that would be like a mean trick. I;'ll just have to throw it away or recycle it...

 On the other hand, I have several copies of the original "Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark" in widescreen, now that movie is  a m a z i n g  . Do yourself a favor and watch the widescreen version of Indiana Jones instead of this bul****  good luck,
