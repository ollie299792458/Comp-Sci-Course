This film is cool...VERY cool, You have Travolta doing the bad guy....a cool bad guy. You have Halle Berry looking cool...but then she would. You have the whole film looking cool...but unfortunatly...NOT good. A superficial, over the top, far fetched story that relies too much on looking cool and blowing things up. The whole thing revolves around a lot of money, millions infact that Travolta's character wants to fund his continuing protection of the American way. He needs a harker to help him though to gain access to this money. In steps Hugh Jackman's character, Stanley. Stan has problems, the FBI shoved him in jail for snooping around their computer system and won't let him near a keyboard. His porn star ex-wife won't let him near his daughter so he finds .... What does save it is two things, a car being one. The British, yes British, car the TVR is a stunner adds more cool to the film but this is GOOD cool, not the bad cool of the rest of the film. The other saving grace of this film is Hugh Jackman. The comparision to a young Clint Eastwood is not  unfounded. He looks good and IS good in this. ....Swordfish is worth watching just for the fact it is cool but don't expect anything great. Just enjoy the sheer nonsense of it.
