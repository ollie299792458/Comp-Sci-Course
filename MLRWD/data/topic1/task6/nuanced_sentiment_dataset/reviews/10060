Revised review after viewing the sub version of the DVDs:

** Initially I gave this poor marks based on not having subs on the blu-ray. I have revised my review to represent the actual content of the DVD version of this show. Fans of subbed anime should buy the DVD version (not Blu-ray) if interested the video quality holds up fine based on my viewing.

The creators of this show did a solid job of transcribing the events of the game to anime format.  Fans of persona 4 should enjoy this show to some extent. They managed to sneak in tid-bits from the game, like way the calendar looks and the flash frame you get from a character's eyes during battle. There are some great action scenes and the characters are accurately portrayed.

My issues with this anime tend to lean more towards the overall tone of the show.  For a story that is supposed to be about a mysterious string of murders it sure is upbeat. Granted, the creators of the game took a drastically lighter tone with the design compared to prior games. The characters spend most of the time acting like idiots and cracking jokes. It does not quite ruin the show, but it does give it a very light slapstick tone where the plot almost settles too far into the background. Also, Kuma/Teddy gets way too much air time which adds to the sillyness.

One last (very)minor gripe is the main character can use multiple personas like the game but at no point do you really see him aquire them. It's funny to see him call "PYRO JACK!" out of the blue when there was no context for him to meet Pyro Jack in the story. Even the charcters in the show are like "WTF?How many personas does this guy have?".

These things hurt my enjoyment of the show but I am aware that it's pure preference and may not bother many people.  I am still hoping the later part of the series cuts out some of the stupidity and gets a bit darker.

Overall I say it's a noble effort and recommend it to persona 4 fans only.
