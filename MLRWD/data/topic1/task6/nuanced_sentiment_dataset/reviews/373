The big plus in this movie is the new perspective on the possible history that inspired the King Arthur myth.  The possibility Arthur was a Roman soldier who was a student of Greek and Roman philosophers is tantalizing and from what I've learned, might even be true.

Another element of this story that I like is the conflict of religions in England at this time.  And for once early christians are not portrayed as the perfect ancient people they frequently are.  They are shown as violent and cruel towards the pagan faiths (Which in this story, many of Arthur's knights are believers of).  However Arthur himself is a follower of early Christianity and is the more idealized symbol of spiritual morality in the movie, as he should be.  The movie touches on the subject of religion without becomming to preachy or biased.  The ancient pagan faiths are shown with respect and admiration, not as evil savages as the church would want you to believe.

However, despite some of the interesting perspectives on history...as a movie, I found it lacking.  Here are some of the reasons why:
-For one, it's predictable.  And the leader of the Saxon invaders is the sterotypical ruthless war-lord.  Not a very inspired bad guy.
-The only conflict between Lancelot and Arthur is regarding Arthurs decision to make a stand against the Saxons, so the melodrama of the love triangle that turns brother-against-brother in the classic story is not there.
-The movie is not directed poorly. Antione Fuqua did an good job, but while watching it I couldn't help but feel that this movie had a sort of "Me too" attitude.  It wishes it was like Gladiator and Lord of the Rings plus a little Pirates of the Carribbean on the side.  It doesnt seem to be able to stand on it's own two legs compared to these movies.

These gripes aside, I did enjoy watching the film.  The action and battle scenes fit the story and are entertaining.  The acting doesn't suck.  But I still feel it could have been better...
