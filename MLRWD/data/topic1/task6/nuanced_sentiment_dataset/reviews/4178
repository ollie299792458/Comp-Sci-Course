some reviewers say it's a 'bad adoption' of one of stephen king's books.  uhh yeh ok.  what page are you on??  ah, pun!  gah...  ok what movie were YOU watchin', buddy??  ah another pun. darnit. what the heck are you talking about, Willis?? i have seen some pretty subpar movie adoptions of s.k. books, and the old addage seems to remain consistent that as a rule of thumb s.k.'s books/novels tend to be BETTER than the movie... usually... almost always... period.
  but this is one of the few very good transitions.
  like another excellent s.k. movie 'maximum overdrive', this one was scripted by him?  maybe that's why like maximum overdrive (which i think was a direct to movie story by s.k.) this one is one of the few most excellente s.k. movies around.
  this is probably hands down not just the #1 BEST (imho) movie adoption of one of his books that i know of, but the SCARIEST.
  following close in quality would IMHO be the original salems lot, or possibly Riding the Bullet, although r.t.b. was NOT so much scary as creepy and interesting.
 i won't even say how many years it's been since i last saw this movie or used a capital letter to begin a sentence, but i just watched Pet Semetary again tonight on dvd after a longgggg time, and despite being 20 + how many years old, it disturbed/scared me even more this time than before!!
  it's so gosh-durned disturbing and creepy that i don't know if i can go back and watch it again anytime soon!!
  and that is saying a lot, for a movie that's one of the best ones ever made. it's actually one of the best MOVIES in my huge dvd library!  and i'm freakin' afraid to go back and watch it!!!
  say that i now, but, after getting over my initial willies, i am sure i will find great delight in re-playing this eerie masterpiece quite a few times.
  assuming i don't come back from the pet semetary before then.. ahhhhhahaha.  ahhHahahahaha. AAAHHaHaHAHAHAHAH  !  see??  i'm disturbing!... just like this movie.
