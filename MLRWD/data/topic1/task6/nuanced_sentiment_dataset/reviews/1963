Its hard to really review this movie because its not really bad or really good. It hovers somewhere in the middle. They tried to make us have a connection to a couple of the female leads before they died, but it didn't really work. They tried to connect us to the three male leads with limited success. I think I only felt somewhat sympathetic towards Laurence Fishburne's character. I also didn't even really feel much about the outbreak itself. Yes, its a big deal when millions die, but this was a movie, and in the movie it felt like I kept waiting for a climax only to find the movie suddenly at an end. You really felt like this was all leading to something truly horrific, or that humanity would nearly wipe itself out, and then it was over. I have no opinion on the supposed political messages in the movie. Some people seem to forget the fact that its still a fictional movie, but what it is based on is possible one day the more we tinker with things that are deadly if they were ever out of our control. I just expected more from a movie based on this kind of subject and it ended up just being very average.
