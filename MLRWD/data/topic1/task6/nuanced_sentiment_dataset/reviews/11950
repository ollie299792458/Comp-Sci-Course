Other reviews for this movie led me to believe that it was going to be something amazing, something I have never seen before, something that I would either love or hate.  It was none of these things.  It was weird, that's for sure, but it was hardly interesting.  The soundtrack alone was enough to make me want to watch the movie muted.  But then all I would have been left with would have been the visuals, and I couldn't do that to myself.  The lens tricks were disorienting and the color scheme was simply offensive, though I suppose I understand what they were trying to do with the wacky makeup.  If I had to pick something that WAS interesting about this movie, it would be the scene in which the two characters, one male, one female, but both played by the same actress, square off in a sexually charged argument before the female character disapears below frame and makes the male character "die" in the Victorian and literal sense of the word.  But this is only interesting because it's the same actress playing both parts. Otherwise, it would have been just more of the same psuedo-philosophical nonsense about what is beauty, what is fame, what is sex, blah, blah, blah...

The one guy does look a lot like Norm McDonald, though.  That was kinda funny. Particularly when he's feining for more heroin.
