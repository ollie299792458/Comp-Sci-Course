Waterworld is a very well-done movie, but it suffers from poor premises: a) even if the Earth's polar ice caps melt completely, there would still be plenty of land above water, b) without land to slow down hurricanes, all those ramshackle "atolls" would have been destroyed long ago, c) the ability to make an air-tight, electrically-powered hydrogen derigible out of spare parts is highly unlikely, d) that a tanker ship would survive with that much cargo aboard for hundreds of years with that many people is impossible, and e) that some form of oral history passed down through the generations would tell tales of great-great-grandmother having Christmas on land.

Still, it is an epic film, with outstanding acting, amazing cinematography and incredible on-water sets.

This movie, already set in the future, would have worked far better as an off-world piece.  An expedition to another solar system finds that their new target home is a water planet, crash-lands and scavenges smaller craft to make sea vessels.  It would cover: a) a completely water-covered world, b) more solid structures that could withstand hurricanes, c) some left-over anti-gravity drives for the derigible, and d) a mother ship of sorts to replace the tanker, and e) that most of the adults were killed trying to save their children and history lost when the spaceship crash-landed.  It would also add much-needed mystery and discovery to the film.  It would be so much more awe-inspiring to have Costner's "Mariner" show Helen an underwater spaceship than an old city.
