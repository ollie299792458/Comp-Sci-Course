It is very easy to dismiss "Moonraker" as being nothing more than a hocus-pocus attempt to blend James Bond with science-fiction.  And to a large extent, it is.  Yet for some reason, I still like it.  Granted,  its plot and premise are by far the most outrageously ludicrous of the  entire series.  But at least it's done well.  Quite well, for that matter.  Unlike "The Man With The Golden Gun" and "Live And Let  Die," "Moonraker" actually looks like a Bond film, and in  fact is one of the most lavishly produced of all 007 epics, scoring highly  on all aspects of glamour.  Its locations are among the most breathtaking  and beautiful in the franchise's history, ranging from the canals of  Venice, to the vistas of Rio, including the spectacular Iguasu falls on the  Argentinian border.  The film's one truly phenomenal moment is its mid-air  parachute fight during the opening.  Few stunts in the series have equalled  it.  And as you learn in the DVD documentary, it was done for real!  Of  course, once the science-fiction really kicks in, you can't help but wish  you were back on earth.  A bad Bond girl (Lois Chilles) also hurts the  film, and Jaws's encore appearance isn't as effective as in "The Spy  Who Loved Me."  But hey, at least John Barry did the music, and you'll  find that the film is surprisingly witty, more often than not.
