This is one of the very finest of Don Bluth's Animated Films. Briefly I'll mention that All Dogs Go To Heaven is a brilliant and moving story that is best watched on your own late into the night. That is the case for me and watching it on blu ray on my ps3 on the sony 32 inch could get better, except maybe for the seemingly infinished restoring job done on the film; the grane and blur in the presentation could be better. Also this Blu Ray has no menu. Its a 25gb blu ray disc so it doesn't have a main menu althought that doesn't mean that you miss out on any extras. This is one of my favourite movies and certainly an excelent example on and animated feature. As with most productions by Don Bluth there is attention spent especially to character animation, which is the key to brining them to life.
As with most Don Bluth films there are moment that make you wonder why they did it and that they don't really fit into the theme of the story.
From the start of the film, while your chuckling to yourslef, untill the end as the credits begin to role, with a tear in your eye, im sure that you will enjoy every moment and that this film will never leave your heart.

(I need  Brazil, the throb, the thrill. I've never been there, but someday I will.)
