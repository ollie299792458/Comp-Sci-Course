Chinatown is a throwback noir thriller set in the broad daylight of southern California. The color palette is all primary: bright yellows and sanguinary reds-the opposite of what you'd expect from the typical noir thriller. Polanski sets the tone and the period perfectly. Unlike most noir films of the forties, though, Chinatown has a great script with fantastic characters, a whirling, looping (but always sensible and believable) plot, and one of the best endings of any Hollywood film of any period. Though it need not be said at this point, Nicholson is at his very best, and even the icy Faye Dunaway comes across as sympathetic. John Huston is a show stopper as a sociopathic multimillionaire. So if you like period pictures about big-time corruption, water shortages, and the seedy birth of a big city, rent Chinatown. It's one of the best pictures ever made. Robert Towne penned the keep you guessing script. Just another unparalleled film of the American seventies, a time when they seemed to come off the line as regularly as clockwork.
