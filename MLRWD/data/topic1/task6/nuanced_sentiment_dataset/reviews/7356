Okay, so this wasn't the greatest film I've ever seen, but I didn't expect it to be. The editing seemed patchy to me, and the dialog got tedious at times. So why three stars? Well, sure it's loaded with clich&eacute;s and plot holes, but the concept is pretty cool and seeing the monster(s) in action was fun -- very clever idea. Besides, half the fun of watching a cheesy horror film is in laughing at the inconsistencies -- for instance, it cracked me up to watch one of the actors very, very carefully remove a vial of nitroglycerin from its padded container, only to have the other actor (after carefully carefully closing the lid) toss it into the truck. Obviously, this is special horror film nitro, created to explode only in proximity to a monster. 
I was particularly confused by one scene, which I am about to describe in detail, so if you want to watch the film, you might want to stop here. 
Our Heroes are huddled around a dead tree, waiting for the Horrible Monster to appear. We hear it approaching, we see it (gasp! it's hideous!), it can't cross the barrier of gasoline Our Heroes created, but then it rears back and seems to fling killer ants OVER the barrier at Our Heroes! Yikes! Fade to black, cut to next scene as Our Heroes awaken, yawn, stretch, and everyone is fine. One of Our Heroes has even been sleeping while sprawled comfortably on the sand, away from the protection of the gasoline barrier. I was so confused that I watched the scene a couple more times. Where did the Horrible Monster go? What happened to the killer ants? Why the heck didn't the thing just step over the gasoline? Did it just run away? Perhaps the gesture that I interpreted as ant flinging was actually a fist shaking, "oh if I could get over there you'd be SO eaten alive" gesture of frustration. Ah, B-horror films, what would life be without you?
