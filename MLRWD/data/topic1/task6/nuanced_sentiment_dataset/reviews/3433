Ok...I'm always supportive of zombie films, indie or big budget...but when I see a big budget movie that's made like a USA up all night "B" movie it makes me sad...The stars I do give this movie are for the decent acting (minus Nick Cannon--who was painful to watch) and special effects (minus the Ving Rhames zombie, which was the worst piece of special effects I have seen since the 80s); not for plot. The Nike silo/bunker looked like a cheap set that the Resident Evil folks decided wasn't good enough for their work.  The super speed was bad but the climbing on the ceiling bit, was HORRIBLE.  I can take a lot of cheesy stuff, but that was not only bad, but unrealistic--if they can climb ceilings, why couldn't get into the ducts the main characters were climbing through? How would a nerve agent meant to paralyze enemy soldiers for 72 hours mutate you into something that can jump 10 feet in the air and climb on ceilings?  a little too farfetched...

I also don't mind borrowing from other movies, but some of the tricks that were taken from Snyder's version of Dawn of the Dead were poorly used and didn't make a lot of sense.  The movie becomes better if you don't even associate it remotely with the original Day and just accept it's a "B" flick.  Would I rent it or watch it on USA? darn straight I would...though it is the poorest of the bigger budget movies.
