At first, the music (something that sounds like it came direct from a Cirque du Soleil CD) and the premise draw you in.  A depression era carnival show, the dust bowl at its worse, the muscular but broken carnies, the coo chi, coo chi girls, the bearded lady, the lizard man and the mysterious guy who runs the whole thing known only as "management."  Who could resist all that?  Not to mention the tall, darkly troubled minister in the throws of discovering that he has powers beyond those of any mortal man.

But around episode six, you realize that while the characters are interesting and the situation compelling, the writers seem to think, that after creating that canvas they could just put their feet up and rest.  Nothing happens.  Aside from the handsome and confused minister, played with class and skill by Clancy Brown (probably best known for his role as the evil Kurgan in the first Highlander film), everybody else predictably moves through their lives, doing a lot of nothing, having a bunch of manufactured dilemmas that no one cares about.

This is a DVD set you'd probably want to rent....and never watch again.  My opinion.
