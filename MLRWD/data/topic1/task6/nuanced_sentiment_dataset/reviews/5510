When they set their minds to it, nobody can put together a scare fest in quite so satisfying a way as the Brits. Here a talented cast, witty script, taut pacing and truly grisly special effects make for one of the most enjoyable and entertaining horror films I've seen in years... and I had to watch it first time through on the Sci Fi Channel! No matter; I went out and rented it the same night, and ordered my own copy the next day. What "The Howling" was to '70's horror flicks, "Dog Soldiers" is for the 21st Century. There is something for everyone here; great battle scenes, boy-toy eye candy for the ladies and Emma Cleasby as the leading lady is the sexiest Thinking Man's Babe since "The X-Files'" Scully. There's even a terrific mano-a-mano between a werewolf and one "puny human" who just doesn't know when to quit or how to be afraid; in other words, your basic everyday British Army Regular! More than enough truly chilling moments, very clever send-ups of overblown movies like "The Matrix" and it even has a cool dog! Lope, don't trot, to your video store for this beauty. This is a new horror classic.
P.S. Don't even bother with "Bad Moon" (argh, egregiously awful), but DO try to find the novel it is based on: "Thor" by William(?) Smith. The book is so much better than the movie as to be a different yarn entirely. WARNING: If you have ever loved a dog, read "Thor" book with hanky to hand.
