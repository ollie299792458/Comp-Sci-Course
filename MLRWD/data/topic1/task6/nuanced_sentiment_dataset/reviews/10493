Larry The Cable Guy is an extremely funny comedian.  Bill Engvall is an extremely funny comedian.  Keith David is a very talented actor.  Danny Trejo is a very talented actor.  But put all this talent together with no direction and a choppy script of failed one-liners and you get Delta Farce.

Bill, Larry, and Everett (D.J. Qualls) are army reserves when they get scooped up in a Iraq deployment.  Finding a quiet place to sleep on the plane, they all curl up in a Humvee, which is dropped during flight problems due to being overweight.  Dumped with them is Sgt. Kilgore (Keith David).  They are dumped gracefully, due to parachutes, into the remote desert of Mexico.  When they wake up, they believe that they are in Iraq.

Finding the first nearby town under attack by banditos, they chase away the bad guys but open up a new can of worms for the townspeople of La Miranda.  Because of Larry's attraction to the Mayor's daughter, even after they discover they're in Mexico they remain to fight off the rowdy bandito gang.

This movie is filled with cheese that has molded.  There are the standard homo$exuality jokes, stilted dialogue, choppy scenes, the old pee-in-the-canteen joke, and not much else to recommend it.  Let's face it, this film is too stupid for even stupid comedy.  It should have been left on the shelf.  If I haven't convinced you, and you're a diehard Larry The Cable Guy fan, then rent first.  Not a purchase DVD.
