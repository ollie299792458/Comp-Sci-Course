Anacondas-The Hunt for the Blood Orchid is a very bad sequel to the 1997 film Anaconda. The film has good acting and special effects, but the problems in this film make the movie just horrible. The first problem- ANACONDAS DON'T LIVE IN BORENO!!!!!!!. The expedition there to find the Blood Orchid, a flower that prolongs life, goes wrong when the crew is attacked by giant Anacondas. This is totally science fiction because Anacondas live in South America, not Asia. The Second Problem- Anacondas are meat eaters. In the movie, the explorers find out that the Anacondas they encountered are so big because they have been eating the Blood Orchird, which prolongs their life. (Anacondas keep growing until they die, so the longer their life, the bigger they are.) This is a major problem since Anacondas eat mammels, not plants. The Third Problem- Anacondas don't eat people. During the expedition, about half the crew is eaten by the Anacondas. Anacondas don't have the stomach or the mouth to eat people.
I can't really think of anything positive to say about this movie other than what I already said at the beginning of the review. All in all, this was a very bad horror movie.
