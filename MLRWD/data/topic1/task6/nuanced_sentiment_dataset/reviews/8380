I enjoyed HSM 1 & 2. But I was disappointed with this one. It was more of the same (which is becoming a theme at Disney.) In this "final" movie the guys are dealing with graduation and where they will end up at college and what they will end up majoring in. Once again, there is the normal drama that threatens to separate Troy and Gabriella... but luckily there is a musical coming up at the end of the year that brings them back together again. What luck!

I know that this is a musical but does it have to have the same plot three times in a row? Couldn't the writers focused on the other characters? Why would Gabriella fall into the same pattern again? I started to become disconnected due to the lack of growth in the characters.

My children enjoyed it (and would be angry if they knew I was giving it this low a rating!) I enjoyed it for what it was: more of the same. If you've seen the other movies then you'll see this one no matter what the reviews say. If this were a movie on its own, though, I doubt you would enjoy it so much.
