If you have seen the first movie (Meet the Parents), you can anticipate the story line in this one: Dina (Blythe Danner) and Jack Byrnes (De Niro) finally meet Greg's (Stiller) parents Roz (Streisand) and Bernie Focker (Hoffman). Since the Byrnes' are very uptight, the Fockers must be quite the opposite. Hoffman and Streisand actually did their jobs perfectly and are the highlight of the movie. What spoils everything is, that Greg doesn't know his own parents and acts with surprise to everything they do. Boring. Many of the 'funny' scenes are highly predictable (boring again) or not funny at all. Like showing a middle finger to a one-year old could be funny? Anyway, the baby character could easily be excluded from the film. And the worst character? Definitively Owen Wilson. The audience at the theater went silent at his arrival on the scene. If you have seen Meet the Parents, you will be disappointed with this movie. It simply does not match up. I did not expect intellectual humor (like the hilarious Monty Python's Life of Brian), but the humor in this movie is really on the level of second graders. The critics were right this time.
