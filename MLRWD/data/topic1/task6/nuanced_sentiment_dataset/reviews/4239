I am sorry to say that this was no where close to a great movie, but it's not an awful movie either. Reign Of Fire begins in London where we see a young boy (Christian Bale's character as a child) going down into a mine shaft. Now, here's where the movie gets confusing, and it never quite recovers. The boy discovers a dragon in the mine shaft and as everybody rushes to get out his mother and everyone but him for that matter, manages to get killed.
We later learn over the next decade how the human race was slowly killed off. There are only a small rag-tag team of survivors led under the now grown up boy, Christian Bale. The next notable part of the story takes place about half way through when Matthew Mcconghey and his band of American survivors role up to Christian Bale and company's hideaway and then eventually formulate a plan to go to London and take out the main dragon. When they finally get to London it only takes them 5 minutes or so (with very little difficulty) to get rid of the dragon. Way too simple. I realized when I had finished watching this movie that I knew little more about the plot then I knew just watching the preview. All in all, it's a big budget monster movie like the hideous remake of Godzilla. The best parts are seeing the great effects used to create the dragon. Aside from that, the acting is also commendable with both Christian Bale and Matthew Mcconaghey (bald but bearded, in an interesting change of role) turning in decent performances.
Other than that, Reign Of Fire is out of heat.
