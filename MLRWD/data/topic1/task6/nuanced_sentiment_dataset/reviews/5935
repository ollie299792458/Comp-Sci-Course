Ahh - the perfect Halloween film!  Better than many of the old classics. This is Tim Burton at his best.  As a child, I loved the gothic tale of the Headless Horseman - and this rendition never fails to ring the bell.  Johnny Depp is well cast as the somewhat nervous, eccentric, but always ernest Ichabod Crane.  Christina Ricci is beautiful and Christopher Walken is perfect as the Horseman. Christopher Lee (Dracula) appears in a cameo role as does a noncredited Martin Landau.  Miranda Richardson is delicious and one might imagine that she thoroughly enjoyed playing her role.

While the film is gory - after all there are lots of heads being lopped off - it's not really scary.  I wouldn't recommend it for children under the age of 10 however - especially those with overactive imaginations. The old animated Disney version is better suited for the little ones.

The cinematography is marvelous - watch for the changes from the vibrant red Cardinal in the beginning to the near black and white motif in Sleepy Hollow. Superb fantasy, great score by Danny Elfman, and a thrilling ride through the forest.  Turn off the lights, get out the popcorn, and enjoy the fun. I'd give it 4.5 stars. As with all films today, this is best seen in widescreen ("Letterbox").
