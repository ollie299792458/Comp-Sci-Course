The X-Files is my all time favorite television show.  I remember waiting with baited breath for each new episode in the paranoid world of Mulder and Scully.  After the show went off the air, i've had a hard time scraping enough cash together to get even one season, let alone all nine that I really wanted.  Luckily Fox is reissuing the frist three seasons at around $40.00 dollars on January 31st, but in the mean time i've gotten my fix from these collections of the anthology episodes.

Overall this is a good collection of some great episodes.  Abduction collects episodes spanning the first four seasons of the show and the abduction theme that dominated most of the story.  Some highlights include my all time favorite episode Fallen Angel, as well as classic episodes like Duane Berry and Paper Clip.

The problem with the piece meal presentation of the show however is that some gaps develop in the storyline.  This is fine for longtime fans of the show like myself who have a working knowlege of the character and their interactions, but people new to the show will have a hard time figuring out characters like Mr. X, Krychek and Skinner who seem to pop up out of nowhere on this collection.  If you've never watched the show, just seeing these episodes would have you believe that Mulder and Scully's relationship develops rather quickly.

I would much rather watch these episodes in context with the rest of the series, but until the new DVD's come out, then I guess this will have to do.  This is recommended for fans who are strapped for cash and can't afford the $120 dollar complete season DVD's.  Casual fans will love this collection because it trims the fat from the storyline that developed around these episodes.  If you've never watched the show, then catch a few early episodes on TNT or Sci-Fi and get the gist of what is going on before buying this collection
