this was a real downer.  The young girls were alway worried about money and doing danceing to help pay for bills.  While paying the bills was a good reason to begain with, the girl become selfish.  They built little friendship or respect of each other.  I could have watched the true life story of any troubled child actor's if I wanted to watch children act for just the money.
The girls in the movie danced and acted because they hand to and in the end they really never learned anything but to keep working even if it was hurting the family.  In the end the family is pulled apart and but since everyone gets what they want it's ok.  Right?!  Keeping the family together and letting the girl have childhoods is not as important as getting the money.  By the way, the girls only have to go to dance school, never mind making their own dress or cleaning their rooms or cooking.  Their parent will do all that.
What a joke.  I would never show this to my nieces because I would hate it if they ended up a spoiled and selfish as these girls.
