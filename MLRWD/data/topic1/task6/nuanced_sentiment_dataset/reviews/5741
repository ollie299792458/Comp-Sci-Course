Firstly I am a Pearl Jam freak. Like many others I give this DVD a five star rating for fans, and 3 1/2 - 4 1/2 for non fans. My initial reaction was huge dissapointment, because vocals sounded harslhy echoed and muddy. I messed with the DVD settings and finaly realized that my Tv was set on surround, which did not do either sound option on the DVD Justice.  After obtaining optimal sound I was blown away. I had seen the band twice before, and I really belive that this really represented a very true picture of this venerable band. Unlike Rage's recent, "Battle of Mexico City" which seemed very much like a stage reproduction of a "Real" concert. I was worried when I learned that most song were from dates, which I thougth would make it somewhat dijointed. The audion and video mix/fades were great(if one ignores the clothing changes). The show seemed to ebb and flow like the band, seemingly replicating one entire show. I wont do a song by song description. But highlithts were many, and the extras were great. A must buy for fans.
