I am happy to say that even though I did not like this movie all that much, James Bond came back with a much better movie in "The World is not Enough." The funk that the writers were in during "Tomorrow  Never Dies" was only temporary.
"Tomorrow Never Dies" just  wasn't all that interesting. The bad guy did not seem all that bad, and you  just never really got all that emotionaly attached to any of the  characters. For instance, I think we were supposed to feel bad when Terri  Hatcher died, but I just wasn't...she just hadn't contributed anything to  the movie before she was erased.
That said, there were some pretty  entertaining action scenes. I particularily liked watching James drive his  BMW via remote while sitting in the back seat. 
Mildly entertaining,  though not a classic. Pierce did much better in his other 2 Bond movies,  though I wouldn't say that it was he who brought down the level of  "Tomorrow Never Dies."
I'd actually think that this is closer  to a 3-star movie, but since I have such high expectations for James Bond  movies, I lowered it a full star for failing to meet that lofty level.
If  you just watched the new movie "The World is not Enough" and are  looking for another great Bond movie to watch, you might want to skip this  one (for now) and see "Goldeneye" first.
