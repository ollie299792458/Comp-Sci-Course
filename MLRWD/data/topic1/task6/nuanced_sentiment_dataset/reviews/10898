I will come out and say that this movie has totally changed how I view man. I thought I new about our nuclear past...now I really know. It is just such an amazing documentary that when you really sit and think about it...the technology in this movie showcases what the world had in the 1960's...I would bet that some of these newer nukes are packing a lot more heat.

I love the part of the documentary where USA is blasting the Russian's for forfeiting the treaty of testing nukes in the atmosphere and says that Russia has no regard for radiative fallout on the world....fast forward a few months....apparently USA has short term memory when they begin testing again. Politics aside...for whatever reason...I felt that clip stood out the most to me.

The ending of this documentary is both chilling and left me sputtering expletives. It was pure insanity to see a training mission heading right into the path of a bomb.

To sum it is...this movie is so good, I will watch it again...something I never do.
