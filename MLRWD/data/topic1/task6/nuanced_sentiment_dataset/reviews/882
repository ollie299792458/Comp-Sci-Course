This review pertains to the product itself rather than the show.  I have read a handful of reviews stating the packaging of this particular item is horrible.  As a manager of a Barnes & Noble, I took these comments to heart and I personally checked all the box sets in our store.  And like betting on a sure-thing, EVERY SINGLE disc of EVERY box set were scratched!  I couldn't believe my eyes.  Each disc looked like it had been dragged across a concrete floor, along with smudging and other strange markings.  Keep in mind, these discs were stored in "sleeves".  They aren't resting in "cradles" like other sets where they can get dislodged and bounced around.  I don't know what to make of it, except that quality control was completely ignored on this one and I'm shocked there haven't been more complaints.  At the very least, there needs to be a re-call of all remaining sets.  This is a real shame, too, because this set has a nice "bonus" disc that contains some pretty good stuff that isn't found anywhere else.  BUYER BEWARE!!
