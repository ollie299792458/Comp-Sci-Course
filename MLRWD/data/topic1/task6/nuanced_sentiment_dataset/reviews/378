The movie is just like the magazine... adult themes abound.
Yeah... it's got nudity/sex. But I'd have to say it has waaay more violence, than sex, so I don't see why the negative reviews all focus on the nudity. I guess some people just have issues, eh? Just because a movie shows some flesh at times, doesn't mean it's a shallow no-brainer, meant for pre-teen boys who are just looking for some gratuituos nudity.
By the way... there's no nudity in the "Lochnar/Girl in House", "B-52", or "Stern" scenes. "Den" and "Canyon" are the only ones that really push the limit. Aside from those two, the only other nudity is somewhat brief.
Sure, the plot isn't that complex or "cerebral", but you're missing the point. Each animated short was done by competely different crews, in different places. The fact that everything ties together at all, is an accomplishment in itself.
Other great "Old-school" animated flicks:
1. Ralph Baschi's "Wizards" and all the "Fritz, the Cat" movies (2, I think).
2. "Twice Upon a Time" - Ignore the music sound-track and just watch the movie... the music ..., but there's not a whole lot of it.
3. "The Last Unicorn" - One of the greatest fantasy tales ever told, in my opinion.
4. "Rock and Rule" - If "Heavy Metal" had a more solid plot...
5. "The Point" - I don't know why I bother. No one has seen this movie, except for me. No one probably ever will. Based on the Harry Nilson album by the same title.
On a side note, "Heavy Metal 2000" ... good animation, good plot concept, bad plot "execution", absolutely horrid voice acting from Julie Strain. (I had to put this here, because "Heavy Metal 2000" .... so bad, I don't want to waste my time talking about it... I've said too much, as it is... I'm just trying to save some people, before it's too late.)
