Wow. I normally only write positive reviews, but this stinker was so appallingly bad that I feel compelled to do other movie-goers the service of telling the truth about this film.  It is very, very bad. It is so predictable, boring and tiresome that I actually had to pick up the Sunday paper to amuse myself during the final moments, since I could already tell how it would turn out.  It does not help the film to have one of the most wooden actresses on earth, Rebecca Pidgeon, in it, because apparently she is married to David Mamet? This is the only possible explanation for why such a stiff person (it's hard to say actress) is put on screen to display one lack of expression while real actors like Hoffman attempt to carry the film. I was gape-mouthed as I watched it. That's how bad it is. And I'm from Chicago, so I am pre-disposed to like David Mamet's work, but this was like a cake with no sugar or flour in it -- wood chips instead of flavor.  Wow. The Larry Sanders Show had more humor and insight in ten minutes than this movie does for its entire length.As an 'inside' look at movie-making, it's funny for about ten minutes. The actors try, but what can they do with such pointless humor and a lead actress who is about an interesting as watching paint dry? Even Julia Stiles and Sarah Jessica Parker have a hard time being interesting in this, and that's really saying something. It's a poor man's Woody Allen -- that's the only compliment I can give it. I have a hard time believing this is the same guy who wrote "Glengarry Glen Ross". What happened?
