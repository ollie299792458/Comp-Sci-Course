May I add they just should have made a 3rd edition with Kiara and Kovu's cub and not this crap? I hated Timon and Pumbaa in the original LK stories and then this comes up.

I mean you have to think of some of things that happened in this movie that makes it stupid, Timon and Pumbaa just went down a river in the pridelands and they were at the oasis, but Simba wondered around in a desert for weeks. What the hell happened? Then they all ran back through the desert to the pridelands. What's going on there? The meerkats were only afraid of Hyena's, but Mufasa made sure that they were never in the Pridelands. Among other things wrong with this movie.

Only thing good about the movie was kawaii little Simba.

And the more disturbing thing was Timon and Pumbaa kissed. O.o I'm all for Yaoi moments and I know the dude who did Timon's voice is gay but still it was scary.

This was the most stupiest 'sequel' Disney has ever come up with. Don't bother buying it.
