"Sixteen Candles" is arguably the most well known film the the 1980s John Huges teen-film cannon.  The film is the exact picture of high school as we try to imagine it as kids, and exactly what we remember when when we are reminescing as adults.

The film centers upon Molly Ringwald as we follow her around on her sixteenth birthday.  Like all girls, Samantha has been building up her sweet-sixteen birthday for most of her teenage life.  When she wakes up on the day she doesn't feel miraculously different, like she had hoped and is dismayed even further when her entire family forgets her birthday.  The day continues from there as Sam is stuck into going to a lame dance with her cousin, giving her underwear to a geek, and going to an un-tamed party.

The movie is a comedy from the perspective of someone who has been there and been all of the major characters in the film.  It is full of humor, but still carries a very big heart.  It is one of those movies that you can watch 5 different times in you life, getting a different experience with every viewing.  It is the definition of a classic 80s film, and is the first film screened in the "Teen Genre" courses in Film School.

This is a new special-edition DVD that finally includes special features such as a multi-part featurette, trailer and "additional extras"
