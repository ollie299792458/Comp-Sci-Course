TV Movies are abundant these days aren't they?  Omen IV:The Awakening became one of the more earlier victims of tv films with unnecessary sequels spawned.  Fox Network, this time, attempted unsuccessfully to spawn more interested in the series and perhaps make a few bob out of this instalment.  The tagline-the terror continues is a very apt one concerning how bad this film actually is.

Damien Thorne has been dead for over ten years.  Rather than attempting to bring back Damien, Fox decide to 'resurrect' the antichrist this time using a female protagonist to play the devil, a she devil if you will.  Two rich attorneys become proud parents of Delia Yorke.  Over time (just like Katherine Thorne experienced) Karen York realises all is not what it seems with her precious child.  Things start to go wrong, unexplained deaths etc  I don't really need to say anymore, this film is a very bad copy of it's original,the only difference being that the devil is played by a ten year old girl.

It's something that an Omen fan will watch once out of curiousity.  It's also something that when you have watched you'll be scolding and kicking yourself for wasting almost 2 hours of your life.  Worthless entry, purely made to make a couple of dollars out of an already dying series.
