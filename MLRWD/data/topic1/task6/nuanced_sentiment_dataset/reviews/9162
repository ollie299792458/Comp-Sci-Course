Lucia has read and re-read a writer's work so often and so passionately that she grows to love him.  She follows him and ultimately confronts him with her devotion and asks if he will live with her.  He reacts positively to the suggestion and things go swimmingly until the writer is confronted with his past and struggles with a transformative writing experience.  Several odd peripheral characters appear and interact with implicit or explicit passion etc etc
There are some foreign films that gain a US audience because they are heavy on the romance (wink-wink nudge-nudge), and this is one of them.  If you want to see attractive foreigners get playful, then this film will meet your expectations.  Don't, however, let its being subtitled convince you that this incomprehensible blur of writer's-imagination-cum-time-travel melange is deep.  It's just pretty people being fleshy.  Not that there's anything wrong with that -- but Kurosawa it ain't.
DVD extras include short statements by nine cast &amp; crew members, a 25-minute behind-the-scenes featurette, stills, biographies, soundtrack information and trailers.  The film is in Spanish with English or French subtitles available.
