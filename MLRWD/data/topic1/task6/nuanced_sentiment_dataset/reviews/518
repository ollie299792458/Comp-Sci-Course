This is the first movie of Deepa Methta's trilogy that I watch. I have never seen any of her work before, and I'm really pleased and impressed with her talent. The photography and music are a delight for the senses, and both directing and acting are superb. The movie awoke in me such paradoxical emotions... I was delighted with the images, landscapes, actors, dialogues, but at the same time I became more and more indignant as the film went by.

I can't digest this kind of treatment towards women. It really amazes me how so many and different cultures around the world think of women as second class citizens, or worse. As impure, as sinners, as disposable objects. And regardless of the time period this is the current treatment for many women around the world. They get ostracized, shunned or killed based on religious beliefs. And in a less obvious way, but it also happens in modern industrialized countries. Still, the movie is a beautiful piece of art worth watching. And as a woman, I do feel empathy for all those women who have to go through this kind of experiences in their lives, and I admire them for enduring them with their heads held high.
