The biggest disappointment for me in this movie was that Lord Henry's lines, which are supposed to be funny and witty, are omitted or truncated in this version. Colin Firth is a good actor, but his lines were mangled by the writers. He'll say the first part of a paradox and then the rest of the line is omitted. Another disappointment is this version doesn't give the characters motivation for their actions. Why does Dorian break up with Sibyl? Why does he kill Basil? The 1945 version provided reasons for each action. This Dorian acts more like American Psycho, Victorian Version. They've added in traumatic childhood flashbacks. That's a symptom of our age - everything must be blamed on childhood. I found it distracting. I did think the women in this movie were well drawn, and this movie does a good job of depicting the homoerotic tensions and the luxuriant opium houses. However, there was much more to the aesthetic movement than that. This version gives us some stuff that older versions have missed, but this version loses a lot in the process. Don't make this the only version that you see!
