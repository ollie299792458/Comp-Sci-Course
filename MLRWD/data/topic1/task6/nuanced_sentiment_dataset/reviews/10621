I picked this movie up because I really enjoy Cate Blanchett and I hadn't even heard of this one, but I really just didn't like it.  I would never buy this movie nor watch it again.  The DVD case said "Psychological Thriller", "Your hairs will be standing up on end", "Weaving looks a lot scarier than he ever did as Mr. Smith in the 'Matrix' films"....needless, to say I was expecting to be watching an exciting, edge-of-your-seat-suspense film, but what I got was a slow, plodding, expose' in the screwed up, tragic lives of drug addicts and the people around them.  It was extremely depressing given the fact that the end of the movie leaves viewers with nothing to feel good about.  These characters don't seem to ever change or truly move past their addictive, manipulative behavior...and maybe that's the point, I don't know.  I did think the acting by all the cast was good...they really seemed to be the people they were portraying...and I still love Cate, but I thought the movie was really dreary with very little suspense unless you count the anxiety of whether they'll get through whatever hare-brained scheme they've come up with to get what they want (ie drugs or money) for the day.
