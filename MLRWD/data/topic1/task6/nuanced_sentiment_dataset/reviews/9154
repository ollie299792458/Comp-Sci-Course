Too many inconsistencies that don't make sense, nor change the storyline if they would've been acurate.
- Buck never referred to himself in public as Buck, it was always Cameron.
- Buck was a newspaper writer, not a TV reporter
- The GC didn't forbid people to go near the wailing wall this early in the series.
- Chloe is blonde in the books
- Dr. Benjudah (sp) didn't take the stand he did in the video.  He never said there was no God, and he invited Buck to the wall, not the other way around.
- In the book, Nicolae didn't have outbursts like at the end of the video.
- Rayford didn't have to beg Hattie for the GC1 pilot job, he was practically pushed into it.  Same for Buck.
Aside from these few examples, too many things were rushed through.  I would love to have seen the part where Verna gets faced by her boss when she tries to give Buck a hard time.  
I'm glad they made this into video, because it was simply entertaining, but I would highly recommend reading the book (the series, for that matter).  If you don't, you're missing out on a great story.
