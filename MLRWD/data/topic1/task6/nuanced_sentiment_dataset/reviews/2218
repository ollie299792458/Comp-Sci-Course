I got Rosario+Vampire Season 1 dvds...
If you love the manga as much as I do PLEASE don't ruin it for yourself by watching this.
It's just...bad. Bad animation, bad transition, screwed up sequence of events, cut out all the good plot and added a bunch of perverted scenes and dialogue that weren't even in the books. Waste of money and time. If you HAVE to see it, watch it on youtube. Please spread word. Thanks. &lt;3 :/ *disappointed*
---For those who read the manga. Refer to this for specifics----
There are like...NO VAMPIRE AONO PARTS! Mizore comes in way too early. They completely skip Mizore's confrontation with the male teacher. They make her ice sculptures fight Moka on the ledge instead of Tsukune ever transitioning. Everytime Moke bites him they show a big "kissie" mark on a blacked out screen! They do this overly silly whispering "Tsukune....Moka....Tsukune...Moka..." thing EVERY EPISODE!T-T I'm so sad. I was looking forward to this! NOT FOR CHILDREN! They show more panties and boobs than plot. >&lt; The poor plot...it never had a chance. Oh btw...Ruby fights them and calls the plants to kill them. Not her Lady. They did a nice job at animating both Mizore and Ruby, but everyone else seemed kinda cheezed up.
