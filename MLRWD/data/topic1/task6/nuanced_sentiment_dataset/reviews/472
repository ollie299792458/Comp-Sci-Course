Jimmy Stewart as Glyn McLintock, scout leader for a wagon train of settlers headed for Oregon, a man running from his past as a border raider and hoping to prove a man can change. He saves Emerson Cole, also a cowboy with a shadowy past, from hanging for a horse "he didn't really steal". Together they fight Indians and a crooked town leader whose lust for money threatens the survival of the Oregon settlers-stranded miles away in their settlement, struggling without the undelivered supplies they paid for. Arthur Kennedy is Cole, the friend who becomes the enemy for McLintock, his lust for gold becomes more important than the lives of the settlers or the girl he wants. Cole steals the supplies to sell for gold, sets the showdown between the two men for the survival of the wagon train and the girl they both wanted. Julia Adams is Oregon settler Laura Baile, the girl caught between them and Rock Hudson stars as Trey Wilson, professional gambler whose loyalty is tested in the showdown for gold over the settlers. One of Stewart's best westerns.
