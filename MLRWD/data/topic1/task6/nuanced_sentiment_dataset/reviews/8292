Long winded yet well acted courtroom drama that preaches its message than give a real argument about the facts. The movie does not even stay true to the novel that was written because the original core of the novel was about the tobacco industry not the gun manufactures. Even so, the acting is the only good thing that this movie has with great turns from Gene Hackman, who has not giving a better performance in a long time and Rachel Weisz, who not only steals the film from the great teaming of Hackman and Dustin Hoffman but outdoes them in spades in the dramatic department as well. She single handily makes this film a much better experience than it really is and that's a huge accomplishment considering the fact that the movie does breakdown after the third act and the script does not try to even explain itself after a while. This could have been a better film but with a low caliber script and a storyline that confuses more than explains, the movie only has the acting to truly carry it and for that, it gets three stars from me. If it were not for the great performances of Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman, who mind you is not in the movie very much at all, this would have been a one star review very easily. That's how bad the rest of the film is.
