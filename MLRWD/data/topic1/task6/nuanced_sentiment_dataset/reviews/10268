With the magic of movies these days, sometimes I wonder really if it is a good thing or not.  I remember seeing "Happy Birthday To Me" for the first time and I very much enjoyed it.  When I heard it was being released on DVD I was extremely excited.  What I purchasd after it was released was something entirely different.  The soundtrack has been changed, or rather UPDATED, I guess to make the movie a bit more fresher for those who have never seen it. For those of us that remember it, like myself, you'll probably be VERY disappointed with the changes.  The opening sequence of the movie has been replaced with it's original scary music, by a more progressive upbeat vocal.  This changes the tone of the movie completely.  To add insult to injury, the $24.95 that I paid for the movie was even more disgusting for me.  You would have thought they would have atleast left the ORIGINAL cover art for the front of the DVD box.  I am sorry, but in my opinion, all these changes have ruined a perfectly good 80's horror movie that I once used to love.  If you have never seen this movie, the changes might be alright for you, however, if this is a movie you have seen before, you might find these changes somewhat distracting.  It's still a great movie, but what the studios need to learn for future reference.....some things should be LEFT ALONE.
