Ok to keep it short I very much enjoyed this new version of my favorite JW classic.  Each movie has its good and bad in equal amounts.  Having watched the original many times I wanted to see this remake with as much of an open mind as possable. I have not read the book so I make no comparison's to that work.

  I have to agree with the assesment that the original was a John Wayne playing John Wayne.  This new version was a darker version of the Cogburn charector. Bridges did a excellant job with his version. Waynes version made him seem a lovable alcohic while Bridges version made him more close to a realistic portrayal of a true alcoholic.( I am a recovering alcoholic hence the focus here.) I found both to be enjoyable based on the time each movie was made and the different audiance of today vs 1969 which is when I 1st saw the original. The weight of each version carries both movies well. Wayne lighter Bridges darker.

Having just watched both versions back to back there is one point that I found that sets one movie slightly above the other. This would be the classic confrontation between Cogburn and Pepper.  I found the Wayne version of that scene to be more exciting and satisfying than the remake.  This is due to one simple prop. There was just something more captivating about John Wayne at that epic moment saying fill your hand you SOB while drawing his pistol and flipping the lever action of his winchester one handed that made the scene more riveting than JB and his 2 pistols. Hollywood hoopla maybe but what a scene. I felt it on a emotional level in the original, not so much in the remake.  Both versions are good I just enjoyed JW a little more. Nostolgia perhaps but one prop can chaNGE THE DRAMATIC IMPACT OF A CLIMATIC CLASSIC SCENE (opps caps lock and lazy lol).

  Well so much for keeping it short but I find both versions to be fine film making of a classic story.  Just enjoy; both are worthy. Just a point of veiw from a dime a dozen movie fan.
