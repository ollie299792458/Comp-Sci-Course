There were some good parts about this documentary. The students' stories were touching, and I was really hoping they would be selected for the schools their parents were trying to get them into. However, I did not appreciate the director not attempting to present the teacher's perspectives or the point of view of the parents that are raising the poor performing students. Schools to be held accountable for the learning and the introduction of new concepts to these students. However, the parents have to reinforce these concepts and instill study habits to their children. If they do not value education, their children won't either, which is a HUGE obstacle for any teacher to tackle. The creator of this documentary also did not hold the children accountable for their own performance either. I felt like this documentary was just bashing teachers and did not portray an accurate picture of what teachers go through on a rounded basis. If a teacher is "bad", they should not continue to teach, but is it fair to base if a teacher is "bad" or not on a test that a student takes on one day out of the school year. These tests do not take into consideration any conditions, work habits, or attitudes these students may have. It is a very unfair system. Parents and kids should be held more accountable, and the government should put more money and resources into the education system. This would result in improvements across the board.
