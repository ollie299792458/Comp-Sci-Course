This movie just plain stunk.  Granted the whole "Rich kids acting tough" idea is probably a little more true than you'd like.  But the movie itself really didn't provide much in the way of a story that most would care about.

The basic premise is just what I mentioned, rich kids wanting drugs and going to "the hood" (hispanic version of it), Hathway and Bijou & assorted boyfriends go for drugs, boyfriends act tough and get put in their place, girls go back later because they want to "act bad" and get more than they hope for, with assorted stretched out lame story line.

Lets be honest, most who are looking to this movie have done so because "The Princess" is getting nude.  Infact you probably read about how nude she really gets from the view shown at the film festival.  Well whatever nudity she may have had is down to a couple boob shots and a brief nipple shot and that's it.  The reports of her showing stuff down south is not here, and any "activities" done down south ain't in it the move either.  There were a couple potential areas where you could see where some potential was there for some hot action, but they got the "alternate ending".  Anyways if you want to see it for a naked Anne Hathway look online, the still shots posted everywhere are about as good as it gets.

PS Don't listen to the default "user" review listed on the page, it's a premade review made by someone (maybe the company) trying to hype the film, look at any other site selling the movie you'll see the same exact review.  The movie is not that good.
