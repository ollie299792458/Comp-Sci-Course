A remake of Magnificent Seven as a Western, this movie is more than a knock-off of Kurosawa.  The story is familiar, perhaps--a band of misfit heroes must defeat the evil bandits who are terrorizing a village.  But the acting in this movie is what makes it great.  The Good Guys are lovingly portrayed by classic actors of the 1960s (Yul Brynner, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughan, Steve McQueen, to name a  few) and even the leader of the Bad Guys is beautifully and complexly portrayed by Eli Wallach.  You have to wonder how much fun they had making this movie, with a cast like that!

If you are a fan of Spaghetti Westerns and all the modern remakes of the genre (Unforgiven, 3:10 to Yuma, etc.) then you really owe it to yourself to see where the revival began.  Thanks to Kurosawa and the various remakes of his movies, the Western took on a new life, with a darker, more modern feel and a far more complex story line.  This is not the simple scenario with the hero in a white hat defeating the man in black.  Instead, the film creates an entirely new hero mythology.  If you're looking for "reality" you won't find it in this movie, but if you're looking for the enduring myths and values that continually draw us to the "frontier", and all the fascinating characters that populate that landscape, then this is your film.  The director, John Sturges, explores the complexity of a series of flawed heroes as they struggle to redeem themselves by saving others.  We see many of the stock characters of modern movies--the restless macho men who can't settle down (Brynner and McQueen), the gunman who has lost his nerve (Vaughan), the perfectionist who can't rest until he's sure he's mastered himself (Coburn).  Many of these characters are richly drawn and unforgettable, which is why this film is a classic.  If you've never seen it before, you're in for a real treat.
