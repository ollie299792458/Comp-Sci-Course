Although I don't have a penchant for shoplifting, pathological lying or frankly caring what the OTHER girls think, I was hooked on Muriel Heslop, hook, line and sinker.  She epitomizes so many of the issues that young girls who are growing up while also painfully growing OUT deal with, and yet, as other reviewers have commented, she puts the pretty, slim girls to total shame.  They seem to have everything she wants: a trim figure, a handsome (but usually cheating) boyfriend or husband, an upper middle class living, etc., but they don't have the heart of our Muriel.
You will both laugh and wince when she is trying on bridal gowns with absolutely no fiance in the wings, calmly and convincingly telling the sales clerks of her wonderful, upcoming wedding, so full of sweet lies and whimsy that you have to feel for her.  Not only does Muriel constantly step on her own feet, she has many mean spirited family members and so-called "chums" to remind her just how pitiful she is, something that especially hits home to this writer.  There always seems to be plenty of people who want to call attention to your faults (especially if you happen to also be overweight and a "geek"), but Muriel has her come-uppance, even if it happens to be via an arranged wedding to a self absorbed athlete who wants nothing but a token.  Only Muriel would pick an ABBA tune for her processional (the feel good "I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do", one of my favorites) but this may be the only wedding she's going to have so let the girl have her fun.
This movie is considered a sleeper which is a shame.  It should be viewed by all girls who ever were or are overweight and feel that true love only comes to the thin.  Sometimes self love is sacrificed in the name of "give-me-somebody/anybody-to-marry" but, at least in Muriel's case, she realizes this in the nick of time.  Give it a look and be ready to laugh as well as ponder.
