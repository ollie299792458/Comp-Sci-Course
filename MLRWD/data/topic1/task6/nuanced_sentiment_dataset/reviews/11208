I just received my copy of this new Universal release of one of my old favorite 50s classics, "This Island Earth". No doubt it would have been nice if they had included some special features to compliment the film, but i would have to say they did a pretty good job on the print quality....It's much better then the previous Image Entertainment release.

Colors are more prominent, the image is clearer and sharper, and the dolby mono sound track is the best i have ever heard for this film..There is occassionally some "specks" in the film image, but not very often (and i think the Image one had that also)...fans of the film should be pretty pleased (especially at this very reasonable price)...

The controversy continues about why this movie is full screen and not widescreen..Actually, i think the Mystery Science version has a "psuedo widescreen"  it's really a full screen image that has the top and bottom "chopped" off to make it look like a widescreen film...."This Island Earth" was not filmed in widescreen!

Anyway, if you are a fan of the movie, don't hestitate to order it, i think you will be pretty pleased.....
