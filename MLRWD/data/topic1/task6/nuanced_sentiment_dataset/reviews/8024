I love White Collar, I really, really love the show.  The writing is consistently excellent, the photography is spectacular, and, well -- Matt Bomer.  What's not to like?  However, the DVD sets themselves...

I discovered the show a bit late, but I'd already seen all of Season One on Netflix.  I bought the DVD mainly for the extras.  And they're nice enough, but I have to say:  These people deliver the *lamest* audio commentary I've ever heard.  Bomer, DeKay, Jeff Eastin and sometimes Willie Garvin and Tiffani Thiessan contribute to commentary on several episodes, and it's hard to credit how *boring* they are.  It's like they keep getting caught up in the show as they watch, so there are long silences (thanks, guys) and then brilliant comments like, "Oh, this part is great.  This was so fun to film."  This does not, I feel, deliver much in the way of insights or extra information.  There's some discussion of the locations, which is nice, and maybe as a New Yorker I'm undervaluing that for people from other places.  Still, I maintain that the commentary tracks on the whole are lame.

And frankly, it does not get better on the Season Two DVD or the Season Three DVD.  In fact, each season seems to provide less in the way of extras than the season before.  Certainly the number of episodes with commentary decreases steadily; in Season Three, there is only one.  Obviously, I didn't think they did a great job with the commentary but it was better than nothing at all.  The value in the DVD's for me *is* the extras; I can get the episodes streaming on Netflix for no cost over my family's membership.  Or, they appear on Amazon Instant (for a price, natch) long before the DVD's come out.  Or, you know, one can catch them on TV. :-)

If you buy the DVD set for any season, I'd go with Season One.  Unless I hear from a lot of people that Season Four's DVD set is substantially better than the last three, I won't be buying it.
