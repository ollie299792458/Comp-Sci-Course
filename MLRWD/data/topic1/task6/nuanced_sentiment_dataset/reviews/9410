Released in July of 2004, Catwoman was destined to become a box office bomb after receiving slews of terrible reviews.  Nearly every critic in the business blasted Berry, Bratt, and everyone else involved in this lackluster attempt at an action film.  Though their words scratched deeper than any cat claws could, nobody can adequately describe how truly awful this film really is.

Mousy aspiring artist Patience Phillips (Berry) spends her days creating advertisements for beauty products.  The rulers of this beauty empire, supermodel Sharon Stone and her egomaniacal husband, are callous and cruel to their employees; and big shocker, they're hiding a dark secret.  It seems the new face cream they're hawking causes some major medical issues.  Unwilling to take a hit to the pocketbook, they cover it up.  That is until poor Patience discovers their dirty secret while working late one night.  After being flushed out a drain pipe, she is rescued by a group of felines and is reborn as Catwoman.  What insues is a laughable farce of a movie, featuring bad acting, bad jokes, and poorly-produced special effects.

Oscar winner Berry rambled on and on at the Academy Awards about how she was paving the way for black actresses in America.  Well, with Catwoman, she paved the way right down the toilet.  While undeniably attractive, she quite simply does a poor job with the role.  Benjamin Bratt seems clueless as the detective tracking Catwoman, and Sharon Stone simply looks bored; as if she showed up just to collect a paycheck.

The lone highlight of Catwoman is the radio friendly song "Scandalous" sung by British pop trio Mis-Teeq.  Otherwise, leave this one in the pan with the kitty litter.  One can only hope that the film's dismal performance at the box office will be reason enough not to create a sequel.
