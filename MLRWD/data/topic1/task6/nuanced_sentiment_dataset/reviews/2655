I was disappointed by this movie. Scorsese is one of the best American directors alive, and the story of New York City in the 1860s is a great subject, exactly the sort of thing Scorsese ought to excel at. 
But the whole project goes weirdly awry. The plot is trite and silly, the sort of boring revenge drama we've seen a hundred times before: It doesn't shed any light at all on the subject of New York in the 19th century. The cast is extremely uneven: Di Caprio is simply not credible as a prison-hardened gang leader (he's still a soft, spoiled, 20th century pipsqueak), Day-Lewis as the villain is so over-the-top he's funny (maybe he meant it to be that way?), and the great Liam Neeson is wasted (literally) in a brief appearance as Di Caprio's dad. Only the smaller roles are well cast, particularly Jim Broadbent as Boss Tweed. (And by the way, what was the Vampire Woman doing in the movie? She seems to have wandered in from the set of Road Warrior.)
Worst of all, though, was the tone of the movie. It was completely off. From the acid-rock electric guitar solo that plays over the big fight scene at the beginning, to the pointlessly flashy visuals (it looked like Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge), to the ridiculous mischaracterization of race relations between Irish immigrant gangs and the blacks, to the offensive use of the Draft Riots (really a huge race riot) as mere background to a phony, anti-climactic duel between protagonist and antagonist--everything was just so weirdly conceived and utterly tone deaf.
What went wrong? Scorsese seemed like the perfect choice to direct this movie, but he blew a great opportunity to tell a great story. Maybe he has no feel for any time period other than his own. What a shame.
