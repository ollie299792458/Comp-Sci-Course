This show hasn't stood up well to the test of time.  If you've never seen it, save yourself disappointment.  If you loved it when you were younger, rent it.

I am one of those who loved it when I was younger.  I had completely forgotten about the show and when I saw it on DVD I rushed to buy the first set.  Now having watched it, I regret buying it.

Now I can't help noticing things I didn't notice when I was younger.  The bad acting, writing, editing, props, and special effects.  Just about everything.  Of course a show this old has to be judged by the standard of its day.  By that standard it is so-so.  Judged by today's standards it's quite bad.  Although it's a bit disillusioning to see how bad the show is considering how much I loved it when I was younger, I don't regret having watched it.  I can't imagine ever wanting to watch it again though.  That's why I recommend renting it if you can.  Get your nostalgia fix and when you're done I think you'll agree that it's not nearly worth the price to own it.

The first DVD in the set has a complete story arc.  Rent that one and you'll have all you need to judge for yourself whether the purchase of the set is justified.  I think you'll be glad you saved your money.
