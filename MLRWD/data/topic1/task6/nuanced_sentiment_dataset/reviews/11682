First, let me say that I was really looking forward to this movie. "The Bourne Identity" is one of my favorite books and I thought that Matt Damon would make a perfect Jason Bourne. 
Unfortunately, the writer and director decided that the original tightly written, intense and moving story would be better as a disjointed, confusing action movie. 
I liked Matt Damon in this movie, I thought he made an excellent Jason Bourne, despite the writing. 
I think that the cameramen and the director need to learn what a camera dolly is, and then learn how to use it. The movement of the camera, in addition to the movement of the characters, was unnecessary and unsettling. In order to watch the movie, I had to keep closing my eyes when the camera moved a lot. This is not entertaining. This is, IMO, arrogant behavior on the part of the director. The extreme camera movements are unneeded and unwanted on the part of most movie viewers.
Both of my sons (in their early 20's) thought that the action sequences were fantastic. I agree, but I also think that a movie needs a good plot, too.
