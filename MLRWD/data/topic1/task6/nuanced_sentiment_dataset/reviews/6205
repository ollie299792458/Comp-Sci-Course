The 1994 version of Miracle on 34th Street is a remake of the classic 1947 version.  It is known to be a great movie to bring holiday cheerfulness to everyone who views it.  It is about a little girl who doesn't believe in Santa Claus and then meets a white haired, jolly old man who says he is St. Nick himself.  It is a very cute movie to watch with family and friends.

 The 1994 version goes into more depth than the old version.  It also has a different ending.  I'm not a fan of how the '94 version ends.  I feel that it never should have been changed.  This might be a spoiler for anyone who hasn't seen the '47 version, but I enjoyed how all the mail sent to Kris Kringle (Santa Claus) was dumped on the judge's desk.  It was a very clear and cute ending.  I feel that the newer ending is kind of unclear.  All that it says is that everyone must believe in something or someone.

 I also don't agree with the love scene in the new version. In the old version, the director successfully got away with excluding a love scene.  The attention was more toward Kris Kringle and Susan spending time together.  It seems that almost every movie has a love story these days and I feel that the love scene between Dorey and Bryan is very unnecessary.

 If I were to recommend someone a good Christmas movie, Miracle on 34th Street would be a great choice.  Except, I would recommend the original 1947 version, but they are both wonderful choices.
