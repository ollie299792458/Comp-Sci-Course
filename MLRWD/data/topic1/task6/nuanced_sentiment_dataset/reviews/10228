However, I do have a couple of nits to pick and I will get them out of the way first.

One, why in heaven's name did they set the story in 1897?  The West was tamed by then.  Almost nothing that happened fit into that time frame, from a trail drive of that magnitude (700 miles) to the raw mining town to the indians on the "warpath" to the encounter with "Smallpox Bob."  If they had set it in 1882 or even 1889, they would have been safe.  I can't help but think that someone slipped up on the research, really.

Two, I love Robert Duvall, but I am getting a tad bored with his patented "Agustus McCrea" impersonation.  I realize that in order to get this project backed he probably did have to promise to reprise his most popular character type.  But couldn't he have given us one or two surprises this time?  Maybe stretch the character a bit?  For instance, why not have let Uncle Print actually take a chance on a real relationship with Nola Jones?  Greta Scacchi gave such a touching and lovely performance one did feel that her character deserved better.

That said, any discontent I may have with the movie is more than made up for by the revelation of Thomas Hadden Church, solid and stunning as an action hero of the best kind.  The almost wordless romance between his character and the character of Sun Yu is completely convincing and totally satisfying.  Oh, and the young woman playing Sun Yu is no slouch in the acting department either.

I also give the production team points for examining the plight of the young Chinese women and of women in general in the West before it was tamed.  Unfortunately, that would have been several years earlier than 1897.  Rats!  I couldn't quite forget it so I decided to pretend that it was mistake by the person who did the graphics for the little introductory comments.  And that worked till a character mentioned the Spanish American War.  Oh...Heck!

But, see...I gave it 4 stars anyway, and that means it was pretty darn good regardless.
