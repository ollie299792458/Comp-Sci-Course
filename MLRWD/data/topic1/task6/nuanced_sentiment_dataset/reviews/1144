The film is great.  Most of you know that so I'm not going to give you a redundant synopsis of the film.  However, I was very disappointed with the DVD considering I've been waiting for years for a new special edition.  That wait was for nothing.

Yes, the film looks and sounds great on the Legacy Series DVD.  But let's be honest, many of us buy DVDs for the special features, and since this is part of the "Legacy Series," this should please, right?  Wrong.

First, don't be fooled that this thing is 2 discs.  I have no idea why it should be because the second disc only has 14 minutes of deleted scenes, the original theatrical trailer (2 minutes), and 8 screens of production notes.  THAT'S IT.  Why couldn't they place this on the first disc?  To make it seem like there was more?  Probably.  No documentaries, interviews, making of featurettes, nothing.  There is a decent commentary on the first disc, but on the whole the DVD package is disappointing considering the original non Legacy Series version of the Deer Hunter didn't offer much either in terms of special features.

Regardless, it's hard not to own this for your film collection.  It is definitely the better of the two versions out there, but don't go in expecting a lot other than the film.  Disappointing package on the whole for a film that deserves so much more.
