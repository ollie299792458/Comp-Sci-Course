This is a mini-series that I think is worth coming back to time and again.  Martin Sheen does a fabulous job of playing JFK.  The series itself continues to surprise despite repeated viewings of trying to show everyone in the most realistic light possible, without sacrificing the narrative arc or the need for entertainment.

It is amazing to me how action packed the 1000 days of the Kennedy administration were and how wide ranging and far ranging the issues that were tackled - i) nuclear war, ii) soviet expansionism, iii) civil rights, iv) space technology advances, v) industry/labor relations etc.

Given later movies and writing on Lyndon Johnson, I wondered if he was shown in a more than unflattering light in this series, or if this was how the Kenndy's viewed LBJ.

Finally, the dialog, script, casting and acting are absolutely top notch and credible.

The extras, as other revieweres have pointed out are absorbing.  Watching President Kenney deliver the Inaugral address is a singularly inspiring experience.

A rare gem.
