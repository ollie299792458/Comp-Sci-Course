I feel that I know good cinema, and I must say that this is a masterpiece by the very talented Tim Blake Nelson.

Whatever criticisms levied at this film are by those who seemingly don't use their noggins ("But what about his job at Brown? At Harvard? Rushed ending, blah, blah..."). Smart people can think for themselves and fill in the blanks without needing every seeming plot inconsistency smoothed out for them. Anyone who enjoys serious movies with true-to-life dialogue should enjoy this - having studied any philosophy or any reading material that isn't superficial and yet doesn't stray into the pretentious should render one able to appreciate this film. It is noteworthy that Nelson actually went to Brown for Classics/Classical Philosophy and that he is from Oklahoma; the authenticity that these experiences lend the film is quite evident. The soundtrack is killer, too!

I really can't stress how much I love this film, mainly because it delves deeply into every issue that it explores, be it philosophy, marijuana production and distribution, Judaism and Kabbalah (after seeing it, google "repairing the world" and "tikkun olam"), and of course the very blunt lives of southerners and how a mere idle conversation can turn to the topic of death as quickly as any other and without any warning, as death often happens in life without warning, just like some of the surprising and effective scenes in this movie. See it!
