Mambo Italiano is an enjoyable piece of sweet fluff.  While it is obvious that the makers of the film are riding on the coattails of the successful MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING the gay plot and different ending put an interesting spin of what many will consider a formula movie.  Well formula or not my partner and I really enjoyed it.

I think the reason this movie succeeds so well is because it isn't afraid to poke fun at itself.  For example, the over the top acting is superb, a good thing too because anything less would be ridiculous.

Not to be too frivilous there are a few serious moments, which add a nice depth to the story.  I particularly liked the scene where the Angelo character (Luke Kirby) asks his ex-lover Nino (Peter Miller) if he had ever loved him.  The reaction on Angelo's face to Nino's lame answer is skilled acting at its best.

Production wise there is no skimping like we sometimes see with other films of this genre.  The movie is crisp, clear and beautiful.  The public garden scenes are especially lush (practically makes you want to move to Canada).  If the production studio didn't drop a ton of money on Mambo Italiano then the director and camera people did a fantastic job making the film look like a big budget Hollywood comedy.  If a lot of $$$ was spent ... well they got their money's worth.
