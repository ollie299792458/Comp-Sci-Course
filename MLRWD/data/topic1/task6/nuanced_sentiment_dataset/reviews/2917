Like many classic war films of the Fifties and Sixties, this movie has little in common with modern thrill-a-minute action pictures, and is actually more of a psychological drama with some action vignettes. Made at a time when most World War II vets were in the prime of life, and perhaps coming to grips with the emotions of their youthful war experience, Hell is for Heroes is principally an examination of how small groups of men interact at moments of extreme stress. In that regard it's similar to the air-war classic Twelve o' Clock High-- which only momentarily shows pilots actually flying in combat-- or Run Silent Run Deep, which is largely a series of drawing-room conversations inside the hull of a submarine.

Here the first 40 minutes is almost a stage play-- a series of character introductions all staged on one set, with the key players entering camera left or camera right. Only then does the plot advance to a series of skirmishes along the German defensive Siegfried Line in the final months of the war.

The classic war-film archetypes are all there-- the conniver, the frightened unlikely hero (Bob Newhart's first role), the gadget fixer, the urban ethnic kid, and the omnicompetent, world-weary noncom. How they handle fear, rage, fatigue, and the burdens of mutual responsibility is what this film is actually about.

This was among Steve McQueen's starmaking roles, but don't expect the King of Cool he later became. In Hell is For Heroes McQueen is a fidgety, burnt-out antihero who soldiers on because he has become very good at the crafts of soldiering. Scruffy, sullen, and unruly, he is probably a little but of what most real veterans saw in their own service: less hero, more hellraiser.

All in all, a worthwhile addition to any McQueen or Don Siegel collection, but not a shoot-em-up.
