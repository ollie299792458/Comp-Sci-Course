This movie had the earmarks of greatness in my opinion, and Tony Goldwyn's performance was a sheer joy to watch, not to mention the rest of the ensemble cast.  The essential message is that Christ returns to earth as a relative unknown (truly biblical), with the exception of a few who recognize Him, and he goes about doing good and healing the sick.  He of course encounters the modern day charlatans and others who try to steer him off course, and to this end, the movie works fine.
However, as it approached the end, I was greatly disappointed, in that now the Catholic Church has to get involved, and Joshua is hauled before the Pope to answer for his actions.  And then in unbelievable fashion, Joshua reveals himself as the Christ and expresses his displeasure in that very same Church for not being the true church which is supposed to preach His message.
As pure entertainment, this might work fine, but don't take it seriously. If Christ were physically alive today, He would be an outcast and rejected by all the established churches, including the Roman Catholic Church, and this is not meant as criticism.  His own people rejected Him when he first walked the earth, and it would be no different today.
