While collecting these old must-have noir classics, I've learned the hard way how important it is to look for and, if available, purchase the film's own studio release. Warner, MGM, Fox, Universal, et al, have remastered and rereleased hundreds of these gems, taking them back from Public Domain and restoring them properly. My copy of the non-remastered Scarlet Street was a "bargain" at under a dollar, but when I received it and tested it on more than one player, I was completely stunned at the poor quality of the transfer by, in this case, the outfit Alpha Video.

It's great that many reviewers discuss the films' storylines and performances, although I think that the quality of the DVD transfer is just as important to explain to consumers. This DVD transfer of Scarlet Street is wreckless at best. Since there is not (yet) a Criterion version of this film, I have gone ahead and purchased the 2005 remastered release and will return this scrappy Alpha Video piece of junk immediately.
