jeez, it is awful, so hard to watch - but i had to finish it, just to see how bad it could get, and man, was i not disappointed!!  nia vardalos cannot act, period - she stands there, posing, so self-conscious, one expression only, which is reminiscent of the joker.  she has no spontaneity, she is so awkward that the camera is on her - when she should be interacting with an actor, she still looks at the camera, to make sure we see her - ridiculous!!  any sort of contrivance is used so that we see her wretched face full on - all diner scenes, and  the museum scene spring to mind, pleeeeeeeeease...  it's all a travelogue about her trying to look cute - good luck...  she treats her so called friends/co-workers like lap dogs - so insulting!!  using gay stereo-types from the stone age??!!  i feel so sorry for john corbett - he is natural, and actually has some merit of charm, but she drains every scene she is in of poise, of wit, of intelligence, of style - as if the movie has those things to begin with...  well, i could go on and on, and i have, but i think you get the idea.  please, run, run as fast as you can in the other direction!!  achingly horrible.
