PLOT
A 30-something executive grows more and more desperate to have a baby. She eventually opts for the surrogate mother option, a choice that brings with it many light-hearted complications.

REVIEW
This is a broadly amusing comedy. The script is reasonably witty. The chemistry between the executive (Tina Fey) and the surrogate (Amy Poehler) is the main attraction here. Talented actors Sigourney Weaver, Greg Kinnear and Romany Malco are unfortunately wasted in unengaging supporting roles. An unbilled Steve Martin, however, does crack a smile here and there as Fey's lunatic boss.

If you're a fan of the TV show "30 Rock", don't get excited. Fey, one of today's most talented comedy writers, did not write or produce "Baby Mama".

I would recommend buying this DVD only if it fell below the US$7.00 mark. Perhaps then it can wait for a rainy day when you're in an undemanding mood and feel like a light comedy. And there's certainly no need to buy it on blu-ray.
