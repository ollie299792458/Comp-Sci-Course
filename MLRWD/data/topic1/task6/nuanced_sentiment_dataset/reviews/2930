I'll admit that David Byrne has gotten on my nerves at times, especially when he has seemed to regard Talking Heads as his sole creation, and when he ignored the efforts of other band members (witness his departure from the stage during "Gratuitous Name-Dropping" - excuse me, "Genius of Love" - and why couldn't Tina sing during "Heaven"?).
That having been said, the slow build-up of the band during the opening songs is compelling. Starting with a guitar, a boombox, and his skittish character, Byrne wrenches across the stage and captivates your attention. Over the next few songs, Tina, Chris, and Jerry join the party, building up the band and showcasing different styles and talents (check the mellower version of "Heaven"). This being latter era Talking Heads, they continue to bring singers, percussionists, keyboard players, and guitarists on stage, building up to full "Take Me To The River" (live version) steam. The excellent music makes up for the silly white suit.
