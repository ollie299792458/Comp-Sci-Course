When I stumbled upon this show that was like my lucky day. This show has made me laugh more than any other show. I love how its funny yet has seriousness and life lessons woven into it. I've seen every season and no matter how many times i watch it I still laugh every time. The first season was great because it really lets you see how doctors feel when they first start out. The bonus features are great to because it shows how the show is made. I think its awesome that its filmed in a real hospital and not just some set. The first season is a bit on the serious side with some drama. It not all fun and laughs the whole time. The other seasons get a little less serious after this one. But all in all I love this show. It is one of my favorites. Watching it makes me happy on those bad days I need a little pick me up. Its one of the best shows out there. As you watch tv you start to notice all the extremely dumb shows out there. All they are is about sex and drugs. The funny shows are usually just plain dumb and have no substance to them. This show balances it out. Its dumb but smart at the same time. I can take some of the lessons from each episode and apply it to my own life.
