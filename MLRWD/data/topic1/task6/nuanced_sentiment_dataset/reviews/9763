As a lover of costume dramas, I was disapointed that such an amazing cast could produce such a spirtless film. Hillary Swank, though a great actress, does little to breathe life into the her character, Jeanne Valois. Though she is supposed to evoke sympathy, besides a few flashbacks we see little that makes her life seem unbearable enough to fabricate the plot to steal the necklace. Most of the characters don't do enough to express their desires and passions, and the plan to steal the necklace seems quite muddled and doomed to fail. One exception is Johnathan Bryce's Cardinal Rohan, the only character I felt was truly three dimentional. In addition to faulty performances, the script tries too hard to wrap up and affair that seems too complicated to neatly summarize in blurbs at the end of the film. All of a sudden, we see Marie Antoinette being executed, with a narrative voice that says something to the effect of "And that was the end of Marie Antoinette." Duh. She's in a guillotine. We miss all the steps of her getting there, however. This film seems to loosly tackles an inticate subject, and proves a thoroghly mediocre affair. Costuming was probably the strongest point, which isn't saying all that much.
