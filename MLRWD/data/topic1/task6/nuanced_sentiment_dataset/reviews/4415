What was interesting about "The Cube" was how many intended or un-intended alegories that existed in this moview, such as:
1)Does the cube represent the state of society and how we react to it?
2)Does the  environment in the cube represent a future that can bring out the best and  worst in people?
3) Does only the truly innocent survive?  Are they the  only ones to "Make it to the light?"  Could this possibly be a  reference to the afterlife?
4) In the future (or present) do we have to  rely on others to survive in our environment?  How important is the  perception to find the strengths and weaknesses in others?
5) How  important is teamwork without selfish motivations?
6) It is never  explained how they arrived in the cube.  Is this a reference to being  born?
7) Is apathy the biggest danger of the future (and present)? Do we  ignore the big picture and only worry about our part in the world  especially if we benefit?
Someone is funding the power and maintenance of  "The Cube," but who?  Is it just a group of people that have to  use it to maintain their funding, but have no idea about the overall  purpose of the device?
