Spoiler's ahead:
When I read the description for this movie, I thought I was in for some great storytelling.  I mean, it stars Smallville's very own Kristen Kreuk!  I've never felt so ripped-off in my entire life.
Where to begin with the problems?  First of all, there's some weird genie character who's freed from a frozen lake - yes, a lake - by the tears of Snow White's father.  Don't expect to find out why that genie was put there, just be happy that he's there to move the "story" along... and turn the father into a king with a kingdom and a queen.
But get this, this queen is really the genie's just-as-ugly sister who is desperate to be beautiful.  She gets her wish as part of the new king's wish to have a queen, but evidently the king doesn't lover her.  So, to make the king love her - and you're gonna LOVE this one - the genie tells his sister to break her mirror.  She does this, and all of a sudden, it starts raining mirror shards in the garden, where the king is seen running for cover.  Before he can escape, a shard of mirror falls into his eye and now he's head-over-heals for the queen.  Oh and wait till you learn just how long that shard stays in his eye. (I need a laughing smiley here.) 
I won't spoil the rest of this waste of technology for you die-hard fantasy fans.  I'll just leave at these cons:
1. The music is lackluster
2. The acting is pathetic. (excluding the guy who played Willow)
3. Snow White herself is pointless.  I just didn't care about her.
4. The mirror changing its mind about beauty is inexplicable and unconvincing.
5. That rainbow the dwarves and 1 regular-sized man ride around on is just ridiculous.
