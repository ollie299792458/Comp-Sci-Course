i bought the movie "coco & igor" along with "coco before chanel" as the reviews were quite good.  but....this has to be one of the
worst movies i have ever seen!  i did enjoy 'coco before chanel'
and audrey tautou did a wonderful job as coco chanel.  however,
"coco & igor" was not even close....the casting of coco chanel
was way off.  the actress anna mouglais, that played coco, was
just too tall for the part and did not at all come across as
coco chanel.  the editing of the movie was horrible as well.
if i could i would return it for a refund.....there was absolutely
no flow to the story and if one did not know any history of
coco chanel or igor stravinksy, it would have been impossible to follow.  there was no need for all the nudity or sex either. that
certainly did not represent chanel at all! i think if she were
alive she would be appalled at this vulgar display.  other
than seeing the chanel fashions and her glorious house, it was
a complete waste of time.
