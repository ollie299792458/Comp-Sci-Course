This version of the well known Godzilla story has one advantage over many of its predecessors; its special effects. Godzilla looks like a living creature as opposed to a puppet, and the look of the movie makes a lot of difference.
However, other than its digital Godzilla, this movie has little to recommend it. The characters are not especially likable; Nick Tatopolous (Matthew Broderick) is unrealistic as the scientist that saves the world; the love interest, Audrey, adds nothing to the movie. Other characters (the head of the army, the mayor of NYC, "Animal" the cameraman) are also badly cast, played, and/or written.
Perhaps the biggest failing of Godzilla, though, is its length. First Godzilla must be defeated; doing so takes at least an hour and a half. After which, Godzilla's hundreds of raptor like offspring must be blown up and lastly, the resurrected Godzilla must be destroyed once again. After each victory viewers are cheering for the end of the movie; twice they are let down before the movie finally, after over two and a half hours, comes to an unsatisfying close.
Filled with rain, explosions, lizards, and the destruction of NYC, Godzilla is a good flick for hard-core action fans who love the Great Green Reptile, aka Godzilla himself. But for the rest of us, its a poorly made take on an overused idea.
