Ohmygawd, what a terrible film! Both my wife and I love Robin Williams,
but he was utterly and completely terrible in this role. The writers
wanted you to laugh at his antics and find him cute and adorable. We
found his character annoying, pathetic and disgusting. His character is
psychotic, and probably a pedophile, with a 12-year old sidekick with
him 24/7. Egads. This is supposed to be a comedy? He spends the whole
movie destroying the relationship of a happy couple through numerous
cringe-inducing actions. The couple later reconcile -- no thanks to him
-- and then THANK him? For what? What were the writers thinking?
Terrible, terrible movie. Left us both annoyed and disgusted. The best
part of the movie (well, the only good part) is when Robin Williams'
character gets decked. I would have kicked him a few times while he was
down too.

Avoid at all costs. We rented the movie for $[...] at Red Box. Wasn't
even worth that.
