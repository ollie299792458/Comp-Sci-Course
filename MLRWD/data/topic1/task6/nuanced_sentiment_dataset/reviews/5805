I first saw Carrie over twenty years ago when I was a young boy. I considered the film to be wonderfully creepy, particularly the final sequence involving Amy Irving. I saw the film again a few weeks ago. All of the actors and actresses gave excellent performances. They are all very talented and to be commended. But I must confess that upon watching it a second time I found the film to be terribly depressing. Perhaps it is not the film itself . Maybe the fault lies within myself. I find that as I become older I wish for the old days when good would triumph over evil at the end of the horror movie. I might be somewhat naive. I grew up watching the Six Million Dollar Man, Batman, and Star Trek. But they were good role models.Today,we see so much terror and suffering in the daily news. I doubt that back in 1976 when this film was made people could have imagined that students would be walking into schools and committing the kinds of atrocities that took place in Columbine High School. Recently, there were similar shootings in Minnesota. I do think that part of the problem--but not all of it--lies with Hollywood. The movies are far too violent. Young people need to have heroes to look up to and emulate. They need to be taught that human beings have a tremendous capacity for good as well as evil. As I mentioned earlier, with regard to Carrie, the acting was flawless, but it is no longer possible for me to enjoy a film in which the main character is tormented so horribly. There is so much hatred in this film. It appeals to our most negative characteristics. The saddest part, I think, is that in taking revenge upon her classmates Carrie ultimately destroys her own soul.
