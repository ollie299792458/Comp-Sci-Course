Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey are two people destined to end up as one in this funny and romantic comedy.
At times Kate Hudson comes across as enchanting as her mother, Goldie Hawn, her smile is absolutely contagious. Her character is a magazine writer who finds herself stuck with the writing assignment of losing a man through all the typical dating "dont's" that women fall into. She is engagingly funny as she talks baby talk, brings over a suitcase full of stuffed animals and carries around a silly toy dog during her 1 week relationship. But despite all her clingy, controlling stupidity she still gets the guy because it is a movie after all.
Matthew McConaughey is his usual gorgeous self playing an ad exec who tries to bag a deal by making a woman fall in love with him, instead of the diamonds in his ad. I imagine this would not be too hard....but the movie makes it out to be. It is one of those romantic play-hard-to-get tales and it works in its own simple way.
So watch it with the girls or on a night spent all alone and hope the man of your dreams looks like Matthew McConaughey, just don't lose him!
