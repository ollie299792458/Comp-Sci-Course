This DVD restored version is the best version of this classic movie that this reviewer has seen.  It does has its good and not so good points, but what doesn't?
Firstly the picture transfer and restoration can be considered a success.  I compared this version to the Laserdisc Moroder(spelling?) version.  My conclusions are that the reduction in the frame rate speed and the inclusion of additional footage make this DVD preferrable.  Whether or not the film was shown with color tints,  I definitely think that this film works better with the tinting, which adds to the the effect of having two separate worlds - that of the workers and that of the elite who inhabit the surface.
The frame speed as played back here has been controversal.  I tried several experiments using the variable playback speed.  At 20 frames per second the action is still not true to life.  One has to get to .65X to make it so.  This speed would be the most preferrable.  The audio, however, does suffer at these reduced speeds.
The audio is  a disappointment.  The score adds little value to this film.  I felt myself not being drawn in emotionally as much as with the Moroder version.  In this case - and I may be in the minority here - I think that a modern (read pop or rock)score, in particular the Moroder score works much better than the classical score, after all it is a futuristic vision we are being shown.  Also, Moroder's use of silence and sound effects are much more effective and at times stunning.
The most useless part of this new release is the commentary.  Granted I did not hear it all but what I heard was someone describing what they thought the religious symbolism was during a  scene.  This was, in my opinion, not appropriate.  This is only someone's impression or opinion.  Commentary on *how* the film was made or what happened during the shot is what should be the commentary subject.
I'm glad I bought this for the study but I'm keeping my Moroder version for the impact.
