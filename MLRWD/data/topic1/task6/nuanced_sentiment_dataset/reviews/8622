I knew nothing of this series beforehand. I was simply looking for some entertaining drama to watch for the weekend. I saw this cover. It looked interesting enough. I noticed it was a BBC production, so I figured it would probably be good. As I settled in on a rainy Saturday evening I planned to watch an episode (maybe two). Once I started, I could not stop until I had watched all 6 episodes back-to-back...and I still wanted to see more! I kept thinking, between episodes, that it must have been torturous for those British audiences watching this series on the tele and having to wait an entire week for the next episode to air! I'll keep it simple: Idris Elba (Luther) and Ruth Wilson (Alice) delivered absolutely top notch performances throughout, and you will be thinking about their characters well after the last scene. The same can be said of the entire cast; all memorable performances. My words cannot do this series justice! If you crave excellent British contemporary police drama, it doesn't get any better than this. I can hardly wait to get my hands on the upcoming second season! LUTHER is destined to be an instant classic. Don't start watching it until you have time to see all 348 minutes. You won't want to stop until you do! Gut-wrenching, hand-wringing, heart-pounding close drama!
