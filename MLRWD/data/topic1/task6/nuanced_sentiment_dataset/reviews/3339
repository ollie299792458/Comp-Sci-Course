First of all I'm not a fan of the series, I just bought this movie because it is one of the first ones to come out in bluray 3d format and I wanted to test my 3d compatible laptop.

My review is based on the 3d experience that I got out of this movie. This is not the first 3d movie I've played on my computer so I have other experiences that I can compare this one to. Now I gave it 2 stars because it seems like there is something wrong with the movie, it stutters. Not all the time, but in almost all the scenes when there is a camera (or angle) change, then I can notice like a flicker or a 1 sec lag (during the transition) and it is really annoying. Like I said I have tested other 3d movies (Alice in wonderland 3d, Imax Grand Canyon adventure) already and this is the only one that I have experienced this issue with. The 3d effect is not very impressive either, not a lot of pop out effect and even in some scenes not much depth effect.

Good thing is that you can play this title in 3d bluray, normal bluray, dvd and it also comes with access to an online digital version.

If you're a fan of the series you might definitely want to pick this one up (add it to your collection) and watch it in any of the preferred formats provided. If you're looking at it only for the 3d effect (like I was) then I would recommend skipping it and look for another one with better reviews (as far as the 3d effect goes).
