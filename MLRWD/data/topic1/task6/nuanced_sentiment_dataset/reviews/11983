Okay, let us start with the positives.  Nicholas Cage and the rest of the cast are fantastic.  Special affects are nice. and the whole look into the future for two minutes thing is a neat and original idea.  Action scenes are fun and fast paced.

But...

The writing is terrible.  The FBI knows that an A-bomb is going to be detonated and they know where.  But instead of detective work and attempting to find the people who are going to detonate the bomb, they are dumping their resources (not all their resources but the use of even one agent for this would be criminal) into finding a guy who can see 2 WHOLE MINUTES INTO THE FUTURE!!!  Yeah, that is useful.  Julianne Moore's character thinks she can use Cage's ability to find the bomb which is somewhere in L.A.  Of course, if the bomb isn't within 2 minutes travel time of her office her plan won't work.  Oh, and her bomb squad will have less than two minutes to de-activate the bomb.  Oh, but wait the films premise gets even weaker from here.

The bad guys are also looking for Cage's character.  How do they know who Cage is?  How do they know what his power is?  How can they be as stupid as Julianne Moore by thinking that Cage could stop them?  We don't know and we are never told.  The ending of this film is terrible and cheats its way out of having to explain most of the problems with the script (But I won't spoil it).

The bottom line is that Next is a movie with a premise, a twist, and without a plot.  It is a fun movie to watch, as long as you turn your brain off early in the film, and I think it is worth a rent.  But it is a little disappointing that the movie producers couldn't find anyone to write a decent script for this movie.
