Imagine my excitement to stumble upon a self-described "thriller" with the ever-enjoyable Michael Caine.  The movie has a truly intriguing premise, with Caine portraying a Nazi collaborator being hunted some 50 years after his crimes.  The movie starts with a bang, quite literally, as Caine kills his would-be assassin and escapes.
But beyond that, the movie goes nowhere and the pacing is slow.  Poor pacing is a forgiveable offense if the drama and characterization is there, but this movie has neither.  Tilda Swinton and Jeremy Northam both sleepwalk through roles that lack depth.  For all the accolades that Caine has received lately, they are least deserving for his performance here.  His character is similarly one-dimensional and lacking nuance or a wide array of anything.  In short, his character is only about self-preservation.  Just because he has conflicts with God does not make him any less self-serving.
As for the plot itself, it does not unravel itself well, even by the end of the film.  Characters that are central to the conspiracy portrayed in the film are given little screen time and even less explanation.  One understands that there is a conspiracy and who the conspirators are, but does not come away with a clear grasp of their motives.
In the end, the film's biggest asset is its exposure (to this viewer, at least) of the Nazi's "final solution" as applied in France, particularly under the Vichy regime.  Unfortunately, it never comes across as anything more than that and will in all likelihood be forever viewed as just another film about Nazis killing Jews.
