Spinal Tap is one of the very funniest movies that I have ever seen.  Certainly, it is the funniest one that I can think of off the top of my head.  If you have not seen Spinal Tap you absolutely MUST watch it at least once.  The movie is an comedy classic.  If you have seen the movie before, and are wondering if the DVD extras are worth the price, wonder no more.  This is a definite must have.  
Most DVDs don't give you much in the way of extras, maybe a documentary and a trailer, if you're lucky.  The Spinal Tap DVD has an interview with Marti DeBergi, a bundle of ads, interviews with the band on television, and tons of deleted scenes.  Also, the DVD has a hysterical running comentary of the three leading band members.  The best part of the DVD is the commentary given by Guest, Shearer, and McKean in character--it's the band Spinal Tap watching the movie Spinal Tap, and giving their opinions of what you are seeing.  It's like getting twice the jokes in one movie. 
To sum it up; I put off buying the DVD because it was a little more expensive than your average DVD, but when I finally caved I found that it was totally worth the extra cost.  Movies like this one are what make DVDs so great.
