I usually don't review movies online, but this one impressed me.  I wasn't expecting much because it didn't get strong ratings, but within 20 minutes of starting the film, I was pleasantly surprised by it's engrossing nature.  Maybe many reviewers didn't like it because it doesn't have expensive digital effects and lots of explosions.  Don't get me wrong, I love those movies too, and I usually only watch the movies without a huge budget when I run out of blockbuster movies.

But this movie was so well done.  The story is interesting, though not completely original.  The cinematography was expertly done, following her around as she explored thumps and clunks, and later as she tried to find a way out of the house.  The whole thing is shot as though we are standing right next to her, experiencing the frights as they come right along with her.  The only things that happen in this movie are things that she sees or hears.  But it's not done in an annoying "Blair Witch" way.  And whoever did the lighting on this movie was a genius!

And that leads me to Elizabeth Olsen.  She was amazing!  I can't believe this is the first time I've seen her act, because she seemed so natural it's like she's been doing it her whole life.  There were many times she was alone, and the movie went for minutes without much dialogue.  But her demeanor and prowess in front of the camera drew me in like no other new actress has since Ellen Page in "Hard Candy."

As I said, I usually don't review movies online, but since the average rating for this movie was so criminally low, I felt I had to act.  I hope you feel the same.
