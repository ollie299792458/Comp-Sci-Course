As someone who HATES horror movies I was very happy to find this as being much more of a psychological, though still gory, movie.  I watched this when it first came out (being dragged there by a boyfriend of course) and was very surprised by how much I enjoyed this~ The biggest reason I am such a fan of this film is because for pretty much every movie or TV show I have ever seen I am able to see/guess what is happening next, but the ending to this movie was a huge surprise to me, and that alone, in my opinion, makes this a movie worth seeing.

Definitively not your normal horror type movie.... more low key though many times at the edge of your seat, and being more psychological it really gets you thinking and guessing.  After all, the main point of this "Killer" is to not kill them directly but make them kill each other/themselves, and in many ways the Killer is the true, though twisted, definition of a Vigilante since the only victims are people that were deemed unmoral, etc.

I think that people who like shows such as CSI will enjoy this movie very much, and the gore level isn't too much higher (for the most part) then the gore in those types of shows.  If you are uncomfortable about even that level of gore, or overall dislike psychological thrillers, then this movie is not for you.

I do highly recommend this movie, but all of the sequels (at least the first 2, I stopped after that... though I did see some of the 3rd) are god-awful... going back to more of the regular "horror movie" type of lame and cheap scare/lots of gore.... a HUGE disappointment after seeing the first.

(as a completely random side note, I have always loved Cary Elwes, especially in "The Princess Bride" so it was interesting seeing him doing a movie like this... though it was sad seeing him as a chubby middle-aged guy... but... it happens I guess, lol)
