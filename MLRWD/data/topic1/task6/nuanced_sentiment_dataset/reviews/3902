I enjoy this film a lot, but for the wrong reasons. It tries to be serious but comes off as parody. It's full of characters that are either all good or all bad. They're too simple to care about but then thats really the intent of the screenwriter. Then there's no need to debate the virtue of vengeance. Right or wrong this movie asks me to accept the need for revenge regardless of it's cost to humanity.

On some level I acknowledge this. Thats where the humor originates. When Harry tells the coffee shop crooks that he, along with Smith and Wesson, can't let them go I'm with him. I'd like to see those m*****f***ers blown away. But on another level I know it would be hard for me to do it because in a real life situation I'd want to know more about those

 m*****f***ers. Who are they? What choices lead them to this moment? Do any of them have families to support, etc? But the film discourages these questions and wants me to defend myself if a gun is pointed at me. Though it would be hard for me to contemplate, in that moment I probably would  kill. And this contradiction makes me laugh.

The film is full of these moments: the coffee shop, the confrontation with the mob boss at his daughter's(granddaughter's?) wedding, and later with the boss's henchman. Then there's my personal favorite, the punks who are acquitted for a crime they probably did commit. How can you not laugh when after being taunted in the courthouse elevator, Callahan grabs the lead punk by his neck tie, calls him d**s**t and then, with a vein bulging in his temple, flings the guy against his buddies?  Classic.

I could give the film no stars for it's blatant endorsement of vengeance. Or it could get five stars for making me laugh at my own internal conflict over its morality. But I land on middle ground, leaning more towards liking this movie. It gets three stars because for me laughter is more satisfying than gunfire.
