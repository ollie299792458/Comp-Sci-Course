It's probably not a good idea to write a review just to take issue with Amazon's editorial review, but I have to say something about their characterization of Fred Kwan/Tech. Sgt. Chen (Tony Shaloub) as a "dimwit". Kwan/Chen isn't a dimwit, he's just very, very "Type B"; a doctor would never sedate him, because that would merely be redundant.  That difference of opinion aside, this is one of the best sci-fi satires ever made. One of the reasons it is is that it works on two levels: on the one hand it satirizes Star Trek itself (watching Tim Allen manage to pull off parodies of both William Shatner/Capt. Kirk and Patrick Stewart/Capt. Picard at the same time is, I think, priceless) and on the other hand it satirizes the whole "Trekker culture". Both satires are affectionate, though, there's no ridicule here, and ultimately we realize that both feed on each other; the stars need their fans just as much as the fans need the stars of their favorite show. Wonderful acting by all the principals (in addition to Shaloub, Alan Rickman and Sigourney Weaver are simply superb (and I hope I look even 1/4 as good as Weaver when I get to be her age), and the rest of the cast work together as a tightly knit ensemble). This is one of the few movies I've seen in the past 20 years that was worth full price at the box office; get out your credit card and order this DVD NOW!!! You won't regret it....
