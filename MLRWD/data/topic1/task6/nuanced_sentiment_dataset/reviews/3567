When this season begins everyone is still trying to cope with the murder of Special agent Caitlin Todd. Some with laughter, some with tears. While Gibbs on the other hand was out for blood. But in the end he's not the one to take down Ari. Soon after the roller coaster ride also known as season 3 really begins. After the loss on a very important female character, the group gains two more to replace her. In the form of the new NCIS director Jennifer Shepperd, and Mossad agent Ziva David who the team is very reluctant to open their arms to after the lost of Kate. Now why is the best season so far you ask? That's cause it's the season of change and emotions. You learn more about Gibbs background, Tony becomes a very capable leader by the end of the season, Ziva grows into her role,and Tim shows why we can really no longer call him a probe anymore. Not to mention some of the greatest moments the show has had so far. Tony gets framed for murder, Tim shoots an undercover cop, Abby's new lab assistant tries to kill her,and Director Shepard gets kidnapped. The thing about this season that just makes it so good is it just seems to hit so close to home, a lot more of the cases this season are personal. But I won't be spoiling anymore moments from this very memorable season. JUST GO OUT AND BUT IT ALREADY!!!!!!!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!
