I know, I know.  You are going to say that the special effects in today's movies are "better" than those of the 1950s.  In general, you are right.  But the neat thing about "The Day the Earth Stood Still" (1951) is that we are not bombarded with special effects.  Consequently, as in the style of Alfred Hitchcock, we are teased, and when the special effects do happen, both visual and audio along with Bernard Herrmann's fantastic music, we are jolted and amazed and caught up in the story.

This has to rank as the best science-fiction movie ever made.  The script (Edmund North) along with the story and the acting move forward at a nice pace with blips along the way to shake us up from time to time.  Of course, there is the direction of the late Robert Wise, and that directing is the thread which holds the movie together, on track, and keeps it on course and so intriging.

Bernard Herrmann was one of the very best of film composers.  He showed us that in "Citizen Kane," "Psycho," etc.  And his music in "The Day the Earth Stood Still" was outstandingly  contemporary.  Let's face it.  The movie would not have succeeded without it.

Here we are, over 50 years later, and the movie is still timely and stands on its own without aging.  One thing about "The Day the Earth Stood Still;" you never get tired of seeing it again, especially on a movie palace screen (standard format, of course).
