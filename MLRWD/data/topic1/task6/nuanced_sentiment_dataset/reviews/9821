The Black Cauldron is one of those films you wish didn't exist. When I saw it, I can't believe how painful the experience was. With a horrible dull plot, dull characters (especially that disgusting creature Gurgi) and less-than-stellar animation, this film shows how low can Disney sometimes go. Growing up with Disney classics, I was surprised at how many things went wrong in this picture. Then, I heard that a new special edition was coming. I thought that was crazy and then I heard it was indefinetely delayed. I was glad.

Today, to my dismay, I see that this picture is given a new Special Edition. What a shame. With many true Disney classics like The Rescuers, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules in desperate need for a new edition, Disney chose to give this crap new improved treatment. That's just sad. I hope new special editions wll come for this classics soon.

One advice, if you have never watch this movie, let me tell you, it's not worth your time. Just pass or if you are curious rent but not buy. It's not worth it.
