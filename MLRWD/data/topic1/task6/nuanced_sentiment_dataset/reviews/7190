Let's see... what's wrong with Children of the Living Dead?  The answer is: just about everything.
Although the opening scene is pretty cool, the remaining 80 minutes are absolutely terrible.  In that afformentioned good scene, Tom Savini kills a bunch of zombies in cool ways (at one point, he kicks one zombie into another, pulls out a gun, and blows both of their brains out with one shot).  Savini also shows off a few of his cools stunts (he is credited as the stunt coordinater).  But Savini dies early, and, from then on, we are forced to watch a bunch of "actors" try to deliver "dialogue" to advance the "plot."  After Savini's death, nothing in this film is done well.  The cast is ridiculous (even the zombie actors are bad), there probably wasn't a script, the gore effects are lame and infrequent (free advice: if you're gonna make a gory zombie movie, the zombie attacks should be the showcase, not window dressing), the cinematographer must've been blind (several boom mikes are visible, and the film really likes to expose the camera crew in reflective surfaces), and the direction is totally inept.
In short, rent Dawn of the Dead instead.  You'll be much happier with the transaction.
