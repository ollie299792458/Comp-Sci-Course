Having not seen the movie in twelve years, when I started watching it earlier tonight I was expecting non-stop slapstick and silly chases. In fact, the movie is somewhat deliberately paced and occasionally a bit slow  (the scene with Niven, the Princess, and the tiger rug, for example -- 20  minutes go by with no sign of Clouseau). But, for me, the real pleasure of  this film comes from watching Sellers. His performance here isn't quite as  nuanced as in some of his other movies (Strangelove, Lolita), but is still  fantastic. A sentence in the little booklet that comes with the DVD says:  "Sellers believed...he must play the bungling inspector with stiff  dignity, no matter what the cost." This belief paid off. No matter how  many times Clouseau/Sellers trips over or breaks something, he is instantly  back on his feet and plowing ahead -- Sellers' acting is at its best in the  moment just after a slip-and-fall. It is in these quick seconds that you  see how brilliant a comic actor he was.
As far as the DVD goes, it's  great to see the picturesque film in its original aspect ratio (looks like  2.35). There are some scratches on the film, but I wouldn't consider it a  defect of the DVD itself. Every now and then, there is a bit of static  floating in the (aural) background.
