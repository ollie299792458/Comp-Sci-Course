The Silence of the lambs is an exellent suspensful horror thriller.Dr. Hannibal Lecter is defenetely the most interesting and scariest character in film history.The novelist (Thomas Harris) and directer (Jonathan Demme) are both genuises.The way they came up with the clues that Dr. Lecter Gave Agent Clarice Starling still eludes me. I do however feel sorry for the character of Buffalo Bill the movie is suppossed to be about him after all and every one only remembers the half hour or so that featured Hannibal Lecter.If you have never seen the movie before after watching it you will be so overwhelmed that by the credits you will have to sit and think a minute just to take it all in. I'm not shor about everyonelse,but the only reason this movie is great is because of Antony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter. His raspy voice simply makes the movie. His eyes and facial expresions alone will make you put a pillow over your face. What not many people no is that The silence of the Lambs is not a first movie it is much more popular than it's preddesesor Manhunter(1986)  which I have never seen and don't intend to see for the simple reason reason that Anthony Hopkins is not Hannibal Lecer the role is performed by Brian Cox.The jail break seen will keep you awake for nights, but don't worry those who dont like blood their is barely any in this film it is just psychologicly scary. This is a top notch film and I would recomend it to anyone,and if your a census taker their may be a line that troubles you. Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I have.
