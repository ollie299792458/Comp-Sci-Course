This review will be quick short and to the point. Lets talk first about the movie per se. The Movie I would classify it as a action comedy. Think of the US version of Godzilla with the type of humor you would see in Shaolin Soccer/Kung Fu Hustle. The Plot is simple: Humans damage nature, nature creates anomaly, anomaly attacks humans (by taking child amongst others), humans attack each other and monster, humans kill monster. The Monster is actually very cool and the effects are decent. The movie does have its funny parts but I would not buy this movie as part of my repertoire.
I have to admit that three things from the HD DVD version really kind of ruined the movie for me. 1st of the sound is not great. The movie hardly ever used the rear speakers. The other thing that really irked me off is that the movie is dubbed into English from Korean and there are no English subtitles (Only Spanish). I am a firm believer that movies should be watched in the language it was made to able too see intonation and the voice of the actor. Third as mentioned in the other reviews, the movie also froze in the last third of the movie twice, which I could get by using the fast forward button despite me having downloaded the latest firmware updates as of 8/4/07. I am using an HD D2.
My advice: Beware! Before buying this movie rent it in HD DVD and make up your own mind about it.
