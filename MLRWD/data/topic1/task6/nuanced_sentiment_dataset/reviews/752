Last exile is GONZO(Vandread, Zaion, Gatekeepers, Kiddy Grade, etc)'s 10 the anniversary production. A lot of money and promotion is put into this anime, so expect some high quality animated works and coloring.(that's what Gonzo is known for anyway.)
For starters, you're going to get a lot of biased review for this anime. Since most people have already completed this series on fansub, and know how wonderful it turned out. However, that's a review for the whole series, not for this DVD. The Amazon editor's review is actully a very professional and well done review for this DVD.
To be truthful, the first DVD of this wonderful series, is pretty dull. First Move contains the first 4 episodes of the series. The first 2 alone was a major turn off for most starters. Episode 3 and 4, which are the 2 main episodes that starts off the story into it's main story line, dies on a major non-exciting cliffhanger. Which really hurts this DVD, and which is why it often gets negative reviews from new watchers.
However, Last Exile is a series that should not be missed. It's popularity in the US market market probably won't bloom till all of the DVDs are out, but when it do, I'll bet you it'll be huge.
