I don't know if this is an issue with this DVD being sold by Amazon in general, or just with the ones sold by OPTI SHOPPER. The version it lists on the page is NOT the one being sold. What they are actually sending out is a Canadian English/French version rather than a American English/Spanish version.

Why is this important, you might ask....because the Canadian version has everything written twice, once in English, once in French. Even the title on the spine of the DVD is written twice. For someone who cares about what the cases look it, this is terrible.

But more importantly, it's misleading advertising. I'm sure for most shoppers, this won't matter for them. But What if I spoke Spanish? What if my DVD player was set up to restrict my children from watching R-rated movies, but didn't have any sort of way to deal with the Canadian 18+ system? There are tons of situations where this could go wrong, all because the seller doesn't label their product correctly.

As for Lucky Number Slevin...a great movie.
