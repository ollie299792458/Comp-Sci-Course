This movie takes historical names and completely misplaces them and puts historical figures in places they never where and even takes their lives before they even passed from this world. For example, Geronimo was never present at the incident where the medicine man was killed. The old scout was never killed in a bar fighting scalp hunters (he lived past the capture of Geronimo). Lt. Davis did kill Apaches while on the campaign (unlike his outrageous narrative claim in the movie where he said he never killed an Apache) and it continues to a point where it is not even worth listing if one examines the actual facts of Gatewood...the myriad of historical inaccuracy is just as bad in this film, which takes a pro Indian side, as the early Hollywood films took a pro white stand and then shrouded their facts with falsities for their own agenda. One may watch this film for enjoyment but should not be fooled by the narrative voice overs as if this is historical fact, because this movie is far from it. If one feels passionate enough about this subject matter, they should use that energy to read an actual book on the incidents which actually happened and those involved and not depend on Hollywood to educate them. It is like watching Dances With Wolves and taken its story line for fact which would lead one to believe that the Pawnee where the aggressors, when it was the Lakota who where the aggressive tribe who took the region and attacked numerous tribes like the Pawnee and Mandan relentlessly (both tribes who lived a relatively sedentary existence and did not roam far from their more permanent village area while the wandering bands of Sioux raided into their territory which laid on the Sioux's ever increasing domain).  The movie, though, is loaded with great acting, and should entertain but it is hard to enjoy it when one knows the reality which it alters and the historical (as this is a fact approach) authority it pretends to relay to its telling.
