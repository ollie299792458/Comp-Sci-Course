So people complain that Hollywood movies follow the same formulas - pick a "gimmick" and the plot is an afterthough hodgepodge of cliches.  I think Indies are just as guilty, and in fact I hate it more when Indies are full of cliches because they have no excuse.  At least Hollywood blockbusters are mostly entertaining.

Sunshine Cleaning is no better than a Hollywood movie.  The gimmick:  Two sisters start a biohazard clean-up service.  I'm convinced this movie started with this germ of an idea alone, not with the desire to tell a family drama story.  It could have gone in any direction - tale of hardship; mystery; comedy.  But I'm pretty sure the idea of the cleaning company came first.  Then come a parade of Indie movie cliches we've seen a million times:  Struggling mom hard on her luck; tension between hard-working care-taking sibling and younger ne'er-do-well sibling; eccentric grandparent; parent committing suicide; someone screaming at a passing train to relieve angst; genius kid (made especially cliche because the kid is a trouble-making brat and the sympathetic mom has a "It's them, not you" attitude when he's sent to the principal's office), etc, etc.  I wanted something original.  It could have been VERY funny.  The morbid nature of the cleaning business wasn't taken advantage of.  I wanted either more dark comedy, or more creative "clean-ups."  Scenes of the sisters on the job were mostly just to establish that they were actually working, not very integral to the plot.

All that said, it was worth watching.  Redeeming features:

- Amy Adams (always)
- Although they didn't exploit the potential of the biohazard cleanup concept, I did like the fact that it was such a lurid business, yet that's exactly why Rose was proud of it.
- It was never boring...I watched with interest the whole time
