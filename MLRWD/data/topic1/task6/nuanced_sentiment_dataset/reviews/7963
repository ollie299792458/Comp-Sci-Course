Neill Marshall knows how to make a genre movie. From the 'Squaddies vs Werewolves' carnage of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RW5BZ0">Dog Soldiers</a>, through the 'Cavers vs Underdwellers' horror of his best film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IHY9TS">The Descent</a>, and on to the 'Lara Croft versus Punk-Rock Cannibal Scots' remake/homage of Escape From New York, the under-rated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00195FUDC">Doomsday</a>, Marshall has cheerfully hacked and slashed his way through many a limb on his quest for B-Movie excellence.

Centurion is no different, focussing on the mythical Roman 9th Company as they were sent into the wilds of Scotland to tame the Picts, and on Marshall's reading, face their annihilation. The soldiers are little more than British Squaddies in Roman Garb, replete with English accents and mano-a-mano bravado that wouldn't seem out of place in modern War movies. Any faint trace of political analogy with the invasion of Iraq that some critics have detected (Dominic West's General is sent into Caledonia for political reasons, and against his military assessment of the situation) is swiftly dropped after a first-act battle that leaves the Company decimated and the survivors on the run from the Picts, who are themselves surprisingly fleshed out, and dealt with somewhat sympathetically.

As Devin Faraci at Chud has pointed out, the last two acts of the movie are then basically a more violent version of the middle section of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and the viewer barely has time to get to know the outstanding Michael Fassbender and his motley crew before they are picked off in a chase across the mountains of Scotland by the unshakeable Pictish trackers. Shooting in the extremes of Scotland, Marshall excels in capturing the landscapes, and this is a beautiful looking movie that makes full use of mountain tops and foreboding forests.

There isn't a lot of originality on display here, but then, Marshall clearly isn't trying to reinvent the wheel. It's clear he isn't working on a budget anywhere near what Ridley Scott had on Gladiator, but he manages to squeeze every drop of money and get it on the screen. (Anyone interested in a more existential/arthouse movie of 'viking vs nature' should check out the lower budget, but equally beautiful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00429MLXY">Valhalla Rising</a>). Centurion is recommended then for viewers who don't mind accepting the B-Movie parameters that Marshall embraces from the get-go.
