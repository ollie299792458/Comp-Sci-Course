Has all the subtlety of an elephant's tread. A group of American soldiers are kidnapped by Russkies, brainwashed to assassinate a Presidential Candidate. The man chosen to do the job is the very wooden Harvey doing all sorts of facial-contortions that are supposed to be passed off as acting. The most debilitating part of the movie is the absurdity of watching that Italian Club-Singer trying, you guessed it, act. Of all the bad looking rats to have ever disgraced America Cinema, Sinatra must take the cake. Few females are thereabouts doing exactly nothing! Few blacks are so generously included in the movie's cast - not real blacks really but light-skinned mullato types.

Not a single character comes to his/her logical conclusion and not even an ambiguous one; they all end up in a vacuum. To call it the best movie of 1960's is absurd. A ridiculous offering! Oh, where are my cards - I would rather play solitaire than watch this American thrash!

Madame Schuyler V. Johnson,
Indian movies are mostly made in Mumbai. New Delhi is India's Capital City. Please do not humiliate yourself by exhibiting such a lack of knowledge that too in a public forum. I used "Russkies" because that is what Poles, Ukrainians and the other so-called oppressed minorities used to (still) call Russians in a derogatory manner. If you cannot take criticism of a third class movie starring a mere Mob-Pimp like Sinatra, then please ask your Government not to export your Thrash movies abroad. I feel like I am addressing an imbecile. I think reviewing Tom and Jerry is beyond you...

JoeyD: You write like the way Miss J (J. Alexander of America's Next Model) speaks.

Joseph: You would've made sense had you read and understood what I have written, instead of ranting like a mad-man. I do not purport to be an Expert in Americanism, but, YOU, are something else. Your clinched comments sound like ravings of a KKK-rejected member. I think you had better visit your shrink. You do need a doctor ASAP.
