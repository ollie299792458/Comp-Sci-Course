I purchased this box set with reservations due to the reviewers who mentioned the bad picture quality and their disappointment with these videos.

When I finally gave in, the price was so great here at Amazon I could not pass it up. On sale, the complete series was the same price as the purchase of a single season.  Who could pass that up?

Well I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The videos came in a really nice book like case each with its own page.  All are will marked and stay where you put them.

The quality of the video and sound is no worse or different than when it originally aired on TV. I have watched the videos on a 19" Flat screen LCD / traditional 32" TV and a 32" flat screen LCD TV and have yet to see any issues with picture or sound quality.

Due South was enjoyable when I watched it all those years ago and unlike many TV shows from my youth, I still like it all these years later.  Paul Gross and the rest of the cast are fantastic.  The story lines are enjoyable to watch and have not become dated as happens with many TV programs.  I am thankfully not sitting here thinking..How could I have watched this once and then paid to own it?

If you enjoyed Due South and are looking to purchase the complete series this is a great deal.
