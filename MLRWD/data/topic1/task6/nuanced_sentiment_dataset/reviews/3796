I remember this movie when it came to theatres. It lasted all of about 1 week and for good reason. Although billed as a comedy, as you would expect any movie to be that's tied to the Dumb &amp; Dumber Farrley Bros.,it's far  from any slapstick that you've seen from them before. Instead, it mixes  drama such as father/son relationships and homosexuality with a 3 legged  dog and a handicapped child who gets pulled by a car in order to deliver  the newspaper. Normally, I would applaud a departure such as this if it  wasn't for the terrible direction, lack of solid plotting, and mediocre  acting, even from one of my favorites, Alec Baldwin. You're never sure if  this is a comedy, drama,or what...The site gags fall flat in the face of  the drama, the story lags, and the plot has holes you could drive a john  deere thru!For example, even if the fathers friend had pull with the judge,  why would his low income stoner of a son be granted the opportunity to  attend a prestigious school in leiu of the slammer? It makes no sense!And  where did the girlfriend come from, out of the blue? Suddenly there's a  girl's school close by?And how is George Wendt, who plays the homosexual,  back into the weekly poker game after being thrown out the week before? And  this is based on a book? All I can figure is that the Farrleys were to  stoned when they wrote the book and made the movie to remember the segues  that lead to the answers to all of these questions. And as a result, that's  how the entire movie comes across; dazed and confused!
