If you were lucky enough to see the original "Show of Shows" with Sid Caesar, et.al., this is a must see.  If you didn't it still is.  The movie is filled with that kind of physical comedy that has all but  vanished.  O'Toole is great - what else could he be?  Is he spoofing  himself or Errol Flynn?  In any event you will have to see this several  times to catch everything that is in it.  The Brooklyn scene is worth the  price of the tape alone.  It's O'Toole's character who seldom knows reality  dealing with reality and how that reality finally catches up with him. Then  there's the confrontation between Bologna (the Sid Caesar character) and  the mobster which is beyond belief in the producer's office.  A little  silly at times but overall it, along with "Stunt Man" show a side  of O'Toole that must be seen to be believed.  As for the rest of the cast,  top notch as well.
By the way, Adolph Green who plays the producer was  also the Professor in the live presentation of "Candide" in  London with Leonard Bernstein in 1989.
