We really enjoyed the story, learning about the violence, depravity, corruption, and cruelty that goes into the diamond trade. However, I wish that a less Hollywood-type Director had crafted this movie. The acting was very good and I don't know how authentic DiCaprio's "Rhodesian" accent is, but it's a powerful film, and I do recommend it.

What ruined it for me were the typical shoot-'em-up and chase scenes, where your star can manage to run in an open street while people are getting cut down left and right, yet manage to dodge bullets on more than one occasion.

And it starts to get ridiculous how many moving, beautifully acted scenes happen while the characters are supposed to be running for their lives. We pause for these interludes, then, when the characters have finished their emotionally charged moments, the bad guys, out of respect for these actors' close-ups, I guess, start charging after them again, and the action blasts on.

A flawed, yet captivating story, that'll make you think twice about the real price of those beautiful diamonds.
