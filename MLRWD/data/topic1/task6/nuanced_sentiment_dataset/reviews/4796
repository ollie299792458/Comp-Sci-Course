Upon reading Caesar's "Gallic Wars" as a child, I developed an intense admiration for the Gallic chieftan, Vercingetorix.  He proved a capable, worthy adversary of the Romans.  It seems that the leaders whom the Romans defeated (Hannibal, Spartacus, Jugurtha, Vercingetorix, etc.) are always more interesting than the Roman generals who defeated them.  Vercingetorix was as monumental a tragic hero as William Wallace, but this story was no "Braveheart."  Perhaps someday someone will produce a fitting cinematic rendering of Vercingetorix's career.
I approached the movie with caution, knowing that Christopher Lambert had starred in some perfectly dreadful action/adventure stories.  Consequently, I was only moderately disappointed by the wooden dialog, incomprehensible episodes, and leaden plot.  I might have enjoyed the movie more had I not already known how it was going to turn out.  
The Roman weaponry seemed authentic.  The gladius (short sword), pugio (dagger), and scutum (shield)were rendered quite accurately.  The pilum (javelin) appeared to me to be patterned after a model used during the era of the Empire, not the Republic.  The legionaries' armor (the lorica segmentata) was also from the era of the Empire.  Republican legionaries usually wore chain mail or scale mail.  The Gallic swords looked more like Viking swords.  Richard Burton's "Book of the Sword" depicts no Gallic swords even remotely resembling the swords that the movie put into the hands of the Gauls.  The Teutons (a Germanic people) were accurately depicted as using the spear as their chief weapon.  The Germans of Caesar's era lived in thick forestlands, wore little armor, and generally couldn't afford enough metal to make anything more than spearpoints.
The epic Seige of Alesia followed the broad outline of the actual historical event.  Caesar beseiged Alesia and was in turn beseiged himself, but prevailed in the end.
