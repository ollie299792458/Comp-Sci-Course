This is one of my favorite movies and showcases a fabulous performance by John Houseman, who was asked at the last minute to act the part.  Other stars,including James Mason, John Gielgud, and Edward G. Robinson had been asked to take the lead but refused, so finally director James Bridges asked his mentor Houseman to take the role.  And Houseman won an Oscar for it as Best Supporting Actor!  He fills the role with dignity and intellect and thoroughly intimidates Timothy Bottoms starring as an eager law student from Minnesota.  The film is also the debut of Lindsay Wagner, see mostly doing mattress commercials these days, but she really is a good actress.  The film is set at Harvard Law School but since the school hated the publicity from "Love Story", also set on the famous Cambridge campus, most of "Paper Chase" was filmed in Toronto.  The movie has many touching and amusing moments and carries you along briskly to the end where the filmmakers finally hit a false note.  I understand what the characters were doing but it struck me as out of character and I never found the ending very satisfying.  That said, the film still has so much to offer including a fun score by John Williams from early in his brilliant career.  The supporting cast is uniformly fine and this is a movie I enjoying watching again and again.
