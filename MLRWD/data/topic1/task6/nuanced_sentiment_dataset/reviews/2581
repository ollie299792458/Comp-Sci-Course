OK, I admit it - I love Johnny Depp. But even I was a bit apprehensive when he was cast as the Demon Barber of Fleet Street. I have been familiar with Sondheim's great musical for years, both from listening to the Cariou/Lansbury cast recording and from my father's vivid recollection of seeing the show on Broadway. So I had my own mental images of what the musical should look like and was fully prepared to find that Tim Burton had a somewhat different vision.

For the most part, however, I really loved the visual aspect of the film. I was sorry that some of the music, in particular the chorus, was lost. But the biggest disappointment was in the casting. Helena Bonham Carter (Mrs Burton) is much too young and has far too weak a voice to be Mrs Lovett. And Johnny Depp, despite all the efforts of the makeup and hair departments, is also a bit too much on the young and pretty side. In fact, I always thought that Alan Rickman, cast here as the judge, would have made a great Sweeney. But I suppose the film would never have been financed without someone like Depp in the lead.

All in all, an interesting if not entirely satisfying version of one of Sondheim's better works. I only wish I could love the film as much as I love Johnny Depp.
