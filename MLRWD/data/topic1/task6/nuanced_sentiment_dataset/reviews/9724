Harry Dean Stanton and Nastassja Kinski are two of my very favourite actors; there are few who are as earthy and 'real' as they. As always, their acting is unparalled, which I think is due to the fact that they are earthy and real.

In this movie you will be taken on a journey unlike any other and one which I have experienced personally in very similar circumstances so I may be a little bias but only a tad, the movie is excellent in its' own right.

This movie is not for every one (there are many dead heads out there) but in any case it deseves 5 stars for it's brilliance and uniqueness. It is refreshing to see 'something different' and not the usual same ol'. This is truly a work of art. If you know excellence when you see it, you MUST SEE this movie.

Every one else has given you the story line, I just want to tell you just how brilliant it is. I LOVE THIS MOVIE. The sound track is also brilliant and fitting. I own both: dvd movie and the soundtrack.

A movie you must see before you die.

Love from me in Melbourne.
