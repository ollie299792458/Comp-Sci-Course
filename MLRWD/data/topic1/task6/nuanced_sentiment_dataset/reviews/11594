The movie takes place in a movie theater where Timone and pumba are watching a moving apparently that they have recorded during the time before they raised Simba. Timone and Pumba watch the movie with the audiance.  Later the film jumps to the part where they meet Simba and raised him.  In the middle of some of the scenes, Pumba or Timone would stop the video which I thought was annoying and distracting.  
This movie stank because it was not about Simba, but more about Timone.  For that reason, I was very disappointed.  His character is very annoying and he's NOT strong enough or appealing enough to be a lead!  I suspect that the guy that did Timone's voice was the executive producer, because he was in every scene.  The story was so weak that I cannot write about it or describe it. What was the point of this movie?  It displayed scence from the original movie--which I loved--but it did not offer me anything except a little bit of backgroun on Timone.  At the very least, Disney could have given us a little background about pumba, or give us a little more on Simba, Kiara or even Zira for that matter!
I cannot believe I spent $19.00 on this DVD.  I give it one start for some of the music.
