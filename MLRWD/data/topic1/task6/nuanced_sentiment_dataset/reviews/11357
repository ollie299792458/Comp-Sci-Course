Maybe there is something girls see in this movie that guys don't. I went to see this with my girlfriend, who thought this was good. I thought this was absolutely terrible. The only time people laughed was when they showed a scene that had appeared in a commercial for the movie. I have never heard a theater so silent during a "comedy" in my whole life.

 Brittany Murphy is a rich girl, Sarah, who falls for a poor dummy, Tom, played by Ashton Kutcher. Sarah's family doesn't like Tom right off the bat, although the best reason they seem to give is that his heritage is Polish. Anyway, they get married and go on a European honeymoon, which turns out to be a huge disaster. Its not funny, and worst of all, you don't really sympathize with the characters, especially Tom, who acts like a really jerk or idiot most of the time. Once they get home, Sarah decides that this marriage isn't going to work. Can Tom win her back? Who cares?

 This movie was a waste of an hour and half of my life that I can't get back. Don't let it happen to you.
