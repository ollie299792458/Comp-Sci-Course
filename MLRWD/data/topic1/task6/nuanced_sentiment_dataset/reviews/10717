Seeing how we already have the Read and Share Bible and volumes 1 & 2 of the accompanying DVD (and love them), I was really excited to be able to review this DVD and add it to our collection. But I have to say, I was very disappointed.

Unlike the other DVDs, this one was not cohesive at all. In an effort to cover as much of the life of Christ as possible, the result was a bunch of snippets of scripture mashed together. It was hard for my 4 1/2 yr old son (and me!) to follow and left us feeling like we had just been rushed through a maze of stories. I was fully expecting a smoother transition between stories and a more in depth look at Jesus' life and ministry.

Due to the content and length of the stories, I'm assuming the target audience for this DVD is early preschool aged children (2-3). With that in mind, I would recommend this DVD to such families, especially if your child has a short attention span and likes constant change.  Otherwise, it was too simplistic and choppy for older children.

Disclaimer: I received this complimentary DVD from Thomas Nelson Publishers with no requirements to write a positive review.
