Is about all I can say after having seen this film. I am in awe as to how dozens of people will put their money behind projects like this. To sum up how funny this movie is for someone that hasn't seen it, I will say this.
(and there are spoilers but i'm sure you'll thank me in the end for saving you 90 mins of your life)
In the movie tom...uh..."plays with" a horse and an elephant and covers himself in a roadkill deer's skin. Meanwhile all the charachters in the movie just don't seem to understand tom's over the top sense of humor and overreact to him. Overall the main plot is so weak that the only way they even try to keep viewers in the theater or on their couches are to give them an overkill dosage of what Tom usually does on his MTV show. Only this time it's not funny at all because all the pranks are being pulled on paid actors that have read the script and know what to expect. Pointless humor can be very funny (if not some of the best sort of humor) but the only people that would let out more than a chuckle are either hardcore Tom Green fans or they're going to laugh once they realized that the entire joke of the movie is that it wastes 90 mins of your life.
