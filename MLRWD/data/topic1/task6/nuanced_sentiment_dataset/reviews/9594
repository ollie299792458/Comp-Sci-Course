Yes this movie had a plot, for all of you saying "why whas she chasing these people??? why did she come after the last tooth?? why this town??" you need to PAY ATTENTION TO THE BEGINING.ill break it down for you, the was this lady who lived in that town a long time ago, and she would give the kids gold coins in exchange for a tooth(why that i dont know maybe just a reason to share wealth).now this lady had a defect she was burned very bad and bright LIGHT harmed her face so she wore a mask(get why she stays in the dark?). and one day 2 kids went to see her but never came back, so the town MURDERED HER while days later the kids where found no harm done to them, her dying words where and i quote" what i took in kindness now i will take in vengence" in other words when she used to give gold for a tooth now she will take LIFE for the tooth.She only goes after those who have seen her face hence why she chases select people, if you dont see her she doesnt bother you.The plot line worked very nicley but the execution lacked, there was alot of tossed in back story as well as the overplayed way they treated the main charactor like a "freak" accusing him of murders hes not even capable of.The predictable doctors dont belive a word of whats going on and it jumps all over at times.The scares are not even CLOSE to "the rings" creep you out wanna look away scares they are jump out scares that are attempted every 5 min.I will say that the voice of the witch thing is very disturbing with surround sound(its lost when it isnt in a theater or 5.1 surround i saw in theater and then on my tv at home and the effect was no where close to the same) Rent it at least if you wanna see a new idea for a horror story(another decent concept while its on my mind is ghost ship) but dont expect some GREAT horror movie.after years and years of them its hard to come up with something new AND good
