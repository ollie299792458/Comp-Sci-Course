I've loved this film for years, and after a recent resurgence of interest, I thought I'd track it down again. Imagine my horror to find that, not only is it no longer available in the UK, but that it still hasn't had a DVD conversion.
Given the quality of some films that have migrated to DVD, and I find this a bewildering shock.
Where's the widescreen transfer that this film is screaming out for?
Grrr.
But, I shouldn't complain too loudly.
The film is excellent, whether seen on video or DVD, and if you haven't added this to your collection, it might be worth some serious consideration. Admittedly, it will never be hailed as an equal to "Back to the Future", or "Ghostbusters", but this does the film no harm whatsoever. As a testament to the 1980's school of kid-friendly movies, this can hold it's head up with pride. If you were to stumble across it by accident, I'd be willing to wager you'd feel it wasn't a waste of your time. Great acting, lovely cinematography, a haunting soundtrack.... add to this fledgling CGI, from Industrial Light &amp; Magic; some Disney-esque lightness, (and some Disney-esque darkness), in a well-balanced way, and most of all, characters who secure your emotional interest until the final credit has rolled. And speaking of the final credits, don't switch off once they start to roll; the game, as Holmes would say, is still afoot....
