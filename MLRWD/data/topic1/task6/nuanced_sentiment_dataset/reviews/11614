Dear Reader,

I find this film hard to believe.  So much of the time, till the last 10 minutes, I tried to give it the benefit.  My review is based on the inconsistency of the film and how it does not manage to keep the time/day and time, place and events in proper sequence.  I guess the producers thought we wouldn't notice suttle differences in what people are wearing, to what people say and do when the camera cuts and pans over to a different angle.

Overall I am disapointed with this film because I went to great lenghts to rent it from our big local movie rental places.  Only one place had it in stock under the foreign sections.

The acting was slow and painful, yet the boy was easy to look at and feel compassion for, regardless of quality of film.  The love romance between the two main characters is too hyped up by the reviews, it is simply a crush that flew in and didn't seem to make a difference toward the end of the film.

Bloom, bloom little one!  We are still waiting!
