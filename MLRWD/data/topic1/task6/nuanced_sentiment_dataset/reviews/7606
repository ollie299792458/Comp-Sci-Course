Don't get me wrong - despite his odd personal life I've always admired Thornton's ability as an actor - he is nothing if not talented but this little piece is a diamond in the rough and as Farmer he shines.  Virginia Madsen's performance is nuanced and heartfelt.  The child actors chosen as their children are each unique and believable - particularly "Shep" - a young man I hope we see more of.  Bruce Dern - despite the brevity of his screen time - is his usual charming self.  The movie is beautifully cast.  The actors chosen to portray the odd lot of townspeople provide full-bodied character development and there's a small part by a big star that does nothing to take away from the rest of the cast.  Without giving too much away, the bad guys aren't all that bad, and the good guys aren't perfect.  Don't be disillusioned, however.  This isn't a cookie cutter "feel-good" flick.  The plot is utterly believable, the directing is top notch, and the execution - but for a few missteps - is engaging.  It's a kind-hearted, makes-you-want-to-believe movie.  I particularly liked a scene where Farmer meets a clip-board toting trespasser in his pasture.  Watch for it - it's understated elegance.  Here's hoping Thornton sticks to scripts with this kind of humanity instead of wasting his prodigious talents on drivel like Bad Santa.
