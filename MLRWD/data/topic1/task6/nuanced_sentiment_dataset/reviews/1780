**Spoiler Alert**  This review may contain spoilers

In this pyscho-thriller, Hilary Swank plays a New York ER doctor Dr. Juliet Devereau, caught in a love triangle which involves her charming landlord Max (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and her ex-boyfriend Jack (Lee Pace). Except for an occasional shot through peepholes and a one-way mirror and the strange behavior of Max's grandpa (Christoper Lee), the first third of the film feels like a romantic movie rather than a thriller. Jeffrey Morgan plays the psycho-killer Max deftly. However, the switch of Max from a charmer to a killer seems abrupt; the script didn't provide much room for Jeffery Morgon to develop the character of Max. Hilary Swank plays a smart and independent professional woman, who is overjoyed of her good fortune in finding a spacious apartment at a bargain rental fee. Unbeknownst to her, her nightmare just begins. Hilary Swank is a fabulous actress who brings forth the plight of a stalker victim vividly. First time director Antti Jokinen created an atmosphere in which the audience seems to be watching Juliet secretly in her own apartment. A small part of the story is told twice through the eyes of Juliet and Max respectively, which reminds me of the 1950 Japanese film Rashomon. The film is well acted, directed and photographed, but the story is thin and sometimes unbelievable, and the characters are shallow. The film can use a more in-depth study of the psychology and motivation of a psycho-killer. The ending is a letdown. Nevertheless, the film is worth a look.
