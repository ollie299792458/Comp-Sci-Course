I watched this entire show in 2010, then again a year later in 2011 and now rewatching it and getting up to episode 18 and I have had enough. Not only is the animation quality poor, but the story and characters stink as well & I hate myself for not realizing this before. Suzuka is a stupid, stuck up bitch who I wish died by getting hit by a truck and left suffering on the road as she draws her last breath. I would totally scream ha-ha and serves you right! Yes, I hate her character that much & the main character yamato who is stupid for talking to her again and again. Honoka was likeable, but she grew annoying. Those two stupid drunk college girls are beyond my hate meter and I wish they would die too...no, I wish they got raped by a chainsaw in their vaginas and then died!! They serve no point in the anime and are just there to annoy the viewer. They are NOT likeable characters at ALL!!  The only good characters are Miki Hashiba and yamato's younger cousin. Everything else is just a waste of time watching and seeing how the stupid story unfolds. I bought this thinking it would be a nice track anime similar to KEY's kanon, air or clannad, but no. Its just an ugly twin of Love hina with a stupid main character surrounded by a bunch of bitches. Id even watch Rumbling Hearts compared to this garbage. The opening and both ending songs are nice though. However, this is just my opinion. If you want to waste your time leaving a negvativle comment then be my guest. Seriously, stay away from this shitty anime. I hate it and about to chuck my dvds out the window.
