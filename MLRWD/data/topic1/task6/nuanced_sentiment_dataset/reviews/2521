In an increasingly conservative world, it helps to look back and see just what those "good old days" we're encouraged to embrace once more were made up of. Boaz Yakin's "Fresh" shows us just how far we've come and how far we have to go--and I don't merely refer to us colored folk in making that assertion. Sean Nelson's character could just as easily been lifted from an Ellison novel, Grandmaster Flash's "The Message," John A. Williams' "The Man Who Cried I Am" or Andrew Hacker's "Two Nations." Fresh is the child who grows up to be a Stevie Wonder, an Ice Cube, or the [person] who steals your car, robs you after that theater engagement, and laughs as he slits your throat. "Fresh" (the movie) doesn't preach, Yakin doesn't take sides--what he does do is show how hard it is under certain circumstances for a hopeful child to grow up without becoming a cynical man. We should alternate televised MLK and Malcom X speeches with "Fresh" on heavy rotation--not during Black History Month, mind you, but every year on the 4th of July. Independence Day, indeed.
