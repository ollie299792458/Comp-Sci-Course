Who wants a movie where the "main" victim gets the grand punishment and everyone else seems to go on their merry way?! I don't like being left frustrated, disatisfied and sickened with the ending. I want some justification. I don't want a story to just move me, alot of times Hollywood thinks that's the definition of success. I want to be left with some feeling of power in the end for the victim. I want to be left with hope. This movie bummed me out big time!  I didn't have the DVD with the comments included so I don't know if some of the mysteries were addressed.  The one abductor's cross ring and the fact his face and demeanor looked like a stereotypical Irish priest, was that a satire on the scandals of priests now in the news today?  Did the cross have another significance as a tattoo on Sean Penn's character's back?  Did the two cross's have a joint significance? What's with the numbered tattoo on his hand?  I'd appreciate anyone speaking on my points. Everyone else just seems to tell the main plot of the story. Repetitious!  If you're not going to add or ask something new, why write!
