This was, simply put, one of the most predictable, boring, and poorly acted movies that I have ever seen. Drew Barrymore cannot do an English accent, and beleive me, that made her performance suffer. I can't  understand the amount of adults who like this film. It is mind-numbingly  simple. As I watched it, I managed to predict every single event before it  happened, and that is no exaggeration. I found myself saying, "No,  please don't say what I think you're going to, please, it's too  predictable." The entire movie was like this for me, nothing was  surprising, and there was no charm in it. I am sick to death of the typical  ending to tripe such as this, wherein the bad guy goes from a rich  upper-class member to a near-slave, doing hard labor who always ends up  being pushed into a pile of something disgusting. The only reason that I  give this movie three stars is becuase I can admit that it is suitable for  children. Only children. It is very cutesy, and easy on the mind. You  really don't have to think when you watch this movie. It provides a fairly  good role model in Danielle, becuase she is an honest person, and a strong  young woman. It is truly a good film for CHILDREN. I sound so cynical in my  review because I still don't know why people over the age of 12 think that  this movie is so great. If you want a more enjoyable film to watch with  your children, get "The Princess Bride." All of my adult friends,  male and female alike, still talk about how much they loved that movie, and  their parents do as well. That film has better acting, actual charm, and  dry wit. The parts that appeal to children are easily bearable, one could  say, enjoyable. I don't mean to sound as acid as I do in my review of  "Ever After", but I really think that it's time America grew up.  This is a film for the children, not for everyone.
