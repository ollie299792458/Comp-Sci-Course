This movie is a great testament to what The Band had accomplished in their "short" 16 year career together.  Some have mentioned how Robbie Robertson seemed to come off as the star of the show, but this was only natural as he and Martin Scorsese were at the biginning of their friendship.  It's great to see Richard Manuel's humor in his story telling and Rick Danko's lovable demeanor.  I had always wished that they could have included more of Garth Hudson's thoughts about The Band.  A true genius is Mr. Hudson, while Mr Helm was a little grumpy.
 Anyway, I was lucky enough to see the film when it first came out and I was just amazed by how powerful their music seemed to me.  Their playing and singing that night (Thanksgiving, 1976) let everyone know that they were still at the top of their game.  Maybe too, there was always a sense of sadness because the viewer knows that this was it for The Band.  As I look at this film again, the sadness is amplified by the fact that Messers Danko and Manuel have left life's stage, as well as some of their guests of that night.
 This film is truly great!  When I first saw it, the picture was really dark. Now it's color is bright.  If you're interested in the music of The Band and you haven't seen it, please do so!  I bought my copy through Amazon.com.
