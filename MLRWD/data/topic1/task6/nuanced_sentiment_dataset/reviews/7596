Love and Basketball is a cute urban story about two childhood basketball players enduring the ups and downs and in and outs within their romance. The plot and cast are well perfected and thought out in the film because the chemistry between the cast is very real.
  Monica (played by Sanaa Lathan, a fairly new actress, The Wood) lives by the game of basketball when she first meets Quincy (Omar Epps, Higher Learning, The Wood), her new next door neighbor.  Monica's first impression on Q is not a good one when he bruises her during an encounter as children in a game of ball.
  Their first attraction is innocent as kids, but quickly fizzles out as they argue and fight continuously as youngsters. Their romance begins again their prom night after fighting their relentless attraction to each other for so long.
  Their romance grows even more as they arrive to the beginning of their careers at college.  Quincy and Monica both deal with their personal and basketball struggles, but their relationship suffers, especially when Quincy finds out that his father is cheating on his mother.  Also towards the ending of the film Tyra Banks makes an guest appearance portraying Q's fianc&eacute;.
  Love and Basketball is a well written, emotion grasping and thought provoking film.  I give this film two thumbs up and a full six stars. I feel this is one of the best urban films out there that is suited for all audiences.  This film does not contain a lot of profanity nor sexual content. Not only is the movie phenomenal because of the awesome cast but so is the soundtrack.  The whole package of the film is superb!  I recommend this film to everyone.  Please if you don't already own this film this is on the top of my must have list!
