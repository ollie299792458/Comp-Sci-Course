Geez, with all the remakes of old horror flicks these days, I'm losing faith in horror films altogether.  This movie goes to prove a point that horror movie creativity is headed south.  The plot sucked, the acting was predictable and the pulse was about as dull as the script itself.  I'm a fan of the Blair Witch mainly because it struck a chord of truth despite it's overly abundant attempt to be true, but the brothers who made that film wasted their budget on this junk.  There are no doubt kids in grade school that can conjour up better ideas, create more realistic suspense and drive you insane with terror.  But these days, horror directors fall back on old ideas, stale scripts with added gore and one or two decent actors, in hopes that their ship might sail, bringing in a budget that will carry them over until a newer, fresher idea surfaces.  Give me your budget, throw in the towel and let me scare the s#$t out of you, because if movies like these are all you have to offer up, then the genre of horror has a fate sealed in doom.
