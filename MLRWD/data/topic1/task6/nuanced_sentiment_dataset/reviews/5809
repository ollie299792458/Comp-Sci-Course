As the title of this film suggests, the Rodriguez family Christmas gathering is not exactly Norman Rockwell picture perfect, due to tensions and conflicts between their father, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina), and their mother, Anna (Elizabeth Pena). The Rodriguez children come in from as far away as Iraq, with their youngest son, Jesse (Freddy Rodriguez) coming home wounded in action. While this film boasts a strong Puerto Rican ethnic flavor of life in Chicago's Humboldt Park district, the central themes are relevant to people from every ethnicity.

One of the most impressive things about "Nothing Like the Holidays" is it's wonderful heart, which shines through the inevitable brushes with clich&eacute; that all holiday films must face. It's a joy to watch the stellar cast create such a believable family of characters that every scene feels right and true... especially since some of the challenges being faced aren't neatly resolved in every case.

More of a drama than a laugh-a-minute comedy, this ensemble film hits the right chord when dealing with the ways some family members are treated differently than others, as well as the way some families seem like they're arguing every time they talk. While a good deal of the story line feels rather predictable, there are heart-warming surprises along the way.
