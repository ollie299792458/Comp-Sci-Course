I'm a fan of old Motown music.  I grew up on it and I still believe it to be some of the most important music ever written in American music history.  Watching this documentary was a total joy.  It not only gives us insight of the working of early Motown, it is a lesson in American pop music culture.  It was also a little sad.  Here these men are the crators of the "Motown Sound" and prior to this documentary, they never received any credit for their arrangements of songs that have each been covered by modern artists time and time again.  I have to tell you, these men were not only extremely talented, but a class act.  I was a little surprised that they were not more bitter toward Berry Gordy for pimping them for their talents without ever giving them credit on any album and moving to California without so much of a lay-off notice.  Anyway, watch this documentary and learn what work, talent and dedication it took for the Funk Brothers to arrange the soundtrack of the adolescence of many.
