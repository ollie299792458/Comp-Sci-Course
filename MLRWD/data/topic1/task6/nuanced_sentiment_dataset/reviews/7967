I really, really enjoyed this movie alot!! It is warm and will very much so keep your attention. The entire cast was great! Now Sean Combs. All the big names in Hollywood Sidney, Will, Glover, Rashad, Ice Cube and the list goes on. But if you can remember when these actors (to name a few) I just named off, they never just came on the big screen with a movie or two and just became Hollywood Blockbuster Stars right off the bat. They all had to start off small and over the years develope their own style of acting. Denzel is a great actor but he sure didn't walk on that red carpet right after his first, second or third movie either. He grinded for many years to get the name he has today. So I think Sean did very well for his first big role and in time I believe we will look back and say Sean Combs has come a long way since Monster's Ball and this movie too. Sean can't just jump into Will Smith, Tom Cruz etc... type movies. He is going to have to sell himself to Hollywood and us movie critics. So I wish people would stop dogging the man out and be patient and let him gather some growth and skill as he continues on his new journey in acting. I really don't care for his rapping much but I think he will do very well in acting. There is always going to be haters who don't wanna see people try new things. So they are quick just judge a person so fast with negative input. So I say, Sean Combs don't let people drag you down with negative weight. You do your thing and keep pushin' to the top! Some day the name Sean Combs will be huge in Hollywood!
Peace
