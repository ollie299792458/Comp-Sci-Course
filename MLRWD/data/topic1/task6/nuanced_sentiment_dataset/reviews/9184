I was 12 when the Entebbe incident happened, and I remember everything very well. Shortly after, three movies about the hijack appeared and this one must be the best of them. I must have seen it some four times, then! In general terms, the movie is fairly correct and provides a fair account on what happened in that summer of 1976. I recommend it for those who were not born yet or for those who want to have a brief notion of how the Israelis did it. If you want to have a deep knowledge about this operation, do order the book "the Entebbe raid" by Simon Dunstan, Osprey publications, highly recomended as are all the books from this author, and available with Amazon.
  The film is now a bit aged and has a few minor flaws, like the C-130s that are clearly MAC USAF fleet - look at the  American camouflage and the MAC ribbon on the fin that no one bothered to erase -  or the IAF Boeing 707s that are actually DC-8s; Good old Charles Bronson is 18 years old than General Dan Shomron was at the time; But overall the movie appears to be correct and gives a good notion of the dificulties the IDF had to face. Actually, the Israeli forces had more chances than you might think. Remember that all the hostages were kept in a Terminal that had been built by an Israeli company, and the Israeli forces had time enough to study its blue prints and rehearse an entry. Still, it was an amazingly risky operation that went very well. My sugestion is for you to see this movie and buy Simon Dunstan's book. Then, you will become an expert about the Entebbe operation...
