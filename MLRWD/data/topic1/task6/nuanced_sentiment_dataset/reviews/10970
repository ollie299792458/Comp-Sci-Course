What more can I say?  This movie has everything you need: The characters  are plentiful, unique and vividly detailed, the plot is engaging and  well-paced, and the visuals are some of the most vibrant and memorable that  I've ever seen (and considering that NES was made 16 years ago, before  anyone knew what "computer-generated image" meant, that's saying  something).  You can't help but be moved by the beauty of the fantastic  world (the first sight of the Ivory Tower is unforgettable) and the tragedy  of its downfall (the Rockbiter's second appearance is simply  heartbreaking).
NES also does its part to remind us that dreams,  imagination, and fantasy in general are at least as important as real life.  The message is blatantly delivered but no less valid for that.  When we  can no longer imagine a world that's different from or better than our own,  when we can no longer imagine ourselves as more than we are, we lose the  ability to make that world or to become that person.  Forget your dreams  and you have nothing to look forward to, nothing to strive for.  Lose your  hope and life becomes worthless.  
Many would say NES is for kids, but  the people who say that are exactly the people who would benefit most from  absorbing the message.  They're right in the sense that children enjoy  fantasy, but what they fail to understand is that while adults certainly  have more specific goals and more refined imaginations, they need to  partake of fantasy every now and again, too.  Anything you can't escape  becomes a prison, and if you forget how to escape reality, your stay will  be long and torturous.  
Okay, lecture over.  Go watch the movie.
