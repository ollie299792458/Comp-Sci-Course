Worst BLU-RAY ever made for one of the best movie classic.
If you are buying the blu-ray for image quality, you will be most likely disappointed.

You can see the poor and inconsistent image quality starting with the opening credit with movie title and throughout the movie. I believe this has to do with the master source used for the blu-ray and poor processing. The blu-ray version is several steps backwards in terms of the image quality and the title & index organization. Throughout the movie, the image sharpness go in and out of focus, many many grainy spots, poor contrast/exposure, and the color saturation fluctuates, resulting into poor quality image. Honestly I have seen much sharper DVD quality of old 60's and 70's movies made by Shemaroo, even when they are played on 120 inch screen without up-converting them(not trying to promote them, but just to give you a fair comparison).
I cannot understand how one can go several steps backward with the new technology and not realize it?
I feel this to be a complete insult to the blu-ray technology and a Bollywood classic with great location, superb cinematography, songs, and story.

I will keep my hope alive for the Yashraaj films to re-release this movie with improved master source and processing, as I know they are capable (e.g. Dhoom blu-ray version to be a good example). In general, buying Bollywood blu-ray, we are taking chances, as there is no guarantee of the image quality, they are little overpriced (especially in US and UK), and in most cases they would put the same source with little or no processing to improve the picture quality/resolution to take advantage of the blu-ray technology.
