Well, Tommy Lee Jones in a sci-fi movie, what else is new?

Well I've seen pleanty of natural disaster movies in my life, typhoons, hurricanes, tornadoes, and here is my volcano induction.

This movie centers around Los Angelous. Our main two actors here are Anne Heche and Tommy Jones.

Well, the story starts out with this nice day in Los Angelous. Tommy Lee Jones is supposed to be on vacation with his daughter, but of course jumps into his job as the head of an emergency service. Not too much action is seen until out of nowhere we here a big boom, and billowing smoke comes out of a sewer, one worker manages to pull himself up. Tommy asks "Where are the others", the man slowly stutters "They Burned", then revealing the other side of his face to be melted. (Almost looking like Two-face from Batman, and then I realize Tommy Lee Jones played two face in Batman: Forever.....)

Tommy Lee Jones can't make heads or tails of this situation, so he wants to stop the subway from running. The subway is in the underground pipe next to wear the workers were all burned alive. But the offer to stop the subway is rejected.

Eventually after about 50 minutes of researching and suspision, this volcano finally erupts through the sewers, causing havoc on the streets of Los Angelos. After a CGI splashfest of lava, Tommy Lee Jones & Anne Heche decide to blow up a new building, in order to start a slide-type thing which draws the lava out of the streets and into the ocean. (oh wonderful!)

Well, theres not too much to say about "Volcano", Tommy Lee Jones I personally thought greatly fit the role of Roark. But the CGI was very noticable with the lava, and I just think this movie was trying to be over the top epic, with its dramatic score and intense scenes. But other than that its an OK movie, and if your a fan natural disaster, panic, science fiction movies I say you'll really like this movie.

I give it 3/5
