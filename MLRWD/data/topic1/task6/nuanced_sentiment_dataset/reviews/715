I was so happy to find out that Cinderella was finally going to be released on DVD.  The movie itself is presented very nicely with bright rich colours and sounds.  It is a shame that the movie was made in fullscreen then widescreen but oh well.  I would have given this DVD five stars but it's the extras that bring the star values down.  Where's the commentary?  The extras disc isn't really anything to write home about.  The only interesting things are the deleted songs and the behind the scenes extras, other than that, every thing else is kind of lame.  I know this was aimed for little girls 5-11 but come on.  Adults will want to watch this movie too.  "Beauty and the Beast", "Sleeping Beauty", "Aladdin" and "Snow White" had some wonderful extras for both children and adults.  I mention those  movies because I own them.  This DVD has been in the works for such a long time and this is all that we receive?  Some really bare bone extras.  It seems as though the production was rushed, extremely rushed.  I wish there was an adult section and then a childs section. I really hope future classics aren't rushed.
