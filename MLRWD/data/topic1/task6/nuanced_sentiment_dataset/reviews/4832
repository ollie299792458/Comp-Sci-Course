I'd summarise the plot, but there isn't one.In fact there's virtually no semblance of a story at all.What there is though, is a string of scenarios that seem to be there with the sole intention of shocking people.But who  are they trying to shock? Not me, I found it quite funny,  maybe a little  borderline on bad taste, but if it didn't have that it wouldn't have  anything except the sex and violence, and it needs more than that to  sustain a movie for 90 minutes. The most shocking thing about this is the  acting, if the kid playing Jorden has a method, that method is sitting in a  forrest and really "becoming one with the wood".So no prizes for  him. The sex quickly becomes boring and repetitive (though I feel this is  intentional) which only really leaves the violence to save this film, which  it does.The bloody, comical violence is so OTT you can't help but laugh at  its results, which often mean someone loses a body part. If this is a  statement on teen life in the nineties, then all it's saying is that it's  going nowhere, boring, with only the odd gem to spice it up a  little.Actually that's a bit harsh.I found it quite entertaining in a  mindless sort of way, even though Greg Araki's style seems to steal from  other directors (John Waters,David Lynch,Tim Burton etc) rather than  develop a style of his own, but if it works for Tarrantino...
