The story had potential, there are so many things that could have made this a better movie.  But for me the most problematic was the acting and the dialog.

Here are two supposedly intelligent people creating life, but at no point in the movie did you ever find that plausible.  The dialog was something you'd get out of grade school, and the actions taken by the two main characters was just ridiculous.  Not even just what they did to create the creature, but afterwards, it just was too implausible.  I don't mind suspending belief for a good fantasy or sci fi movie, but the characters have to at least be something you can connect with.  The female lead just acted like a spoiled brat the entire movie, a complete distraction.  There seems to be no cohesive flow from one set of actions to another, no believable justifications for their actions and decisions.

The only performance that wasn't a distraction was that of the creature they created.  That part was actually fairly well done.
