I actually watched this about a year ago and was thoroughly disappointed. Typically when that happens, I decide to wait an extended period of time to give something I REALLY wanted to like a second try. In the interim I actually decided to buy the book to see if that would help me gain a new perspective on things.  A year later and I just finished watching Gomorrah for a second time.  Unfortunately, I still feel the same way I did after the first viewing.  There are no characters to latch on to and the storylines are extremely disjointed.  While the book definitely helps fill in some of the blanks - overall I still found this film very lacking.

It's one thing to accurately depict the miserable conditions people caught up in that vicious cycle, (either by choice or not) have to face.  This movie most definitely gets major kudos for presenting the harsh realities of what life is like when surrounded by lifetime criminals.  But it's another thing entirely to engage the viewer more.

I guess I would finish by saying as a movie, I found Gomorrah ineffectual because it failed to entertain on any level. (And by entertain, I know this is pretty horrific subject matter).  I suppose if you go into this looking for a beefed up documentary type film, you could possibly think this is great. But if you go into this looking for a story to be told that has a plot line and character arc/development you'll be left very wanting indeed.
