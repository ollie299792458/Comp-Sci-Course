I LOVE these Peanuts animations, but the sound is terrible. The thing that glues all the Charlie Brown features together is the Vince Guaraldi soundtracks, which are the third dimension to all the Peanuts specials -- and are arguably better than the animation itself. Alas, in all these "remastered" and unremastered DVD versions of the Peanuts classics, whoever mastered them was no musician: all the low end is gone, the lyrical background figures lost to lameness. Remastered means REMASTERING ALL OF IT, including the soundtrack, bringing all the details into sharp relief. There's none of that here, or in any of the Peanuts DVDs. What we're left with is so sterile and soulless, as all DVDs and CDs sound, that I've started collecting the VHS versions. The only way to watch these classics in their original state is via ancient, fading video tapes which preserve the original analog warmth and fidelity. I should note that I'm a professional musician, so my ear and musical memory are superior. If you're average, you won't be able to tell the difference. If you're a musician, you're gonna be disappointed.
