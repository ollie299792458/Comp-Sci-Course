A really boring movie.  I just can't get over how excited I was to see it and how great the previews looked... but how utterly slow and boring it was.  It had the narrative quality of, "Emperor's New Groove" and the plot of "Cinderella III: Twist in Time."  All about a kitchen boy who loves Cinderella but never gets his limelight or the girl... but Cinderella's evil stepmother twists fate around while trying to change the balance of good and evil... and kitchen boy ends up getting the girl in the end.  The wit was slow, the humor was slow, even the movements of the characters were slow paced!  I had a hard time staying interested at all.  My 3 yr old and 1 yr old did enjoy watching the movie though.  So, it obviously has enough cartoon interest for small children.  If it hadn't been for the little ones being interested - I would have shut the DVD off OR there was the option of shoving a sharp stick in my eye to keep from watching it... the movie was just that riveting... not.

In summary, I hated it.
