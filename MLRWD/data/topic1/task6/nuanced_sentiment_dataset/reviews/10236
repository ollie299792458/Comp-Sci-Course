Although I am not a huge action movie fan, I have really enjoyed several of Stallone's films.  This one is no exception.  I know the critics really bad-rapped it, probably in part because they were comparing it to the original. Well, I haven't seen the original, so I am judging the 2000 version on its own merit.  While I think some parts of the plot could have been more fully developed, overall, I enjoyed the visual style, the music and particularly the relationship between Stallone and Rachel Leigh Cook in the movie.  I enjoyed seeing Stallone's vulnerable side as he tries to make amends with his family and comes to terms with what happened to his brother and niece.  His pain over not being able to prevent either incident is tangible, and I was glad to see him kick some serious butt because of it.  I think he really was trying to help his niece realize that her painful experience and any other mistakes she made don't necessarily have to define who she will become.  Maybe he felt the mistakes he made had defined who he had become; but even he is able to overcome that somewhat, by opening his heart and loving his familly.

The extras on the DVD are great, too.  The original trailer and the 2000 trailer, as well as the commentary by the director are real pluses.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who likes action and anyone who likes Stallone
