Many romantic comedies today rely on being cute and somewhat romantic.  They forget the comedy part of the genre description and barely qualify as romantic.  
Thankfully, Two Weeks Notice, strives to be funny with it's dialog and uses the undeniable chemistry of it's lead actors Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock to create funny situation after funny situation.  The film only really gives into full fledged Pretty Woman esc romance at the end.  Which was a good choice where the film is concerned because you get to know and like the characters and you care about the outcome of their lives.  The characters are human and make mistakes, the film allows them to be funny yet real.  
It is an over all enjoyable film to watch, and if you must choose only one "romantic comedy" to see this holiday.  Choose Two Weeks Notice.  Though only a three on the overall movie scale, compared to other romantic comedies to come out in the last couple of years it could get 4 or even 5 stars.
It's a light, fun way to spend the afternoon on a cold December day.
