I basically agree with most of the "bad" reviews this DVD received. Well, not the DVD, but actually the film itself. I just wanted to point out at an interview Matt Groening gave, probably to prepare the release of the movie. He said kind of proudly his staff of writers right now grew up watching The Simpsons. And that's the key to understand such a phenomenal low in the history of the show: The first writers actually grew up NOT watching The Simpsons, but watching decades of good and bad American TV. They grew up watching Hitchcock, Kubrick, Bu&ntilde;uel, Hieronymus Bosch, Picasso, "Tron" and every conceivable movie Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever made. Oh, and reading, yes, comic books, but also Poe, The Bible or Stephen King.... And not just watching The Simpsons. Or Family Guy. These days the difference hardly matters, except that Family Guy is less patronizing. The rest is just cheap excuses: This is a bad show an hour too long with the visual muscle of Futurama. And it just proves you can have all the firepower in the world, but it takes good work to make a good movie. If you still think it's a good idea to buy an animated feature to watch with the family, go get Isao Takahata's "My neighbors the Yamadas". That way you'll also get a cultural reference The Simpsons will never give you. Why two stars and not just one? Well, I actually liked the Spider Pig Song, so there's a star for Mr. Paul Francis Webster and H. Zimmer.
