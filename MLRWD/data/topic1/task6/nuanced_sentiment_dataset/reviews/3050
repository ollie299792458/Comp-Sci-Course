This is a great film with unusual visual and story elements. Brando is superb and Karl Malden possibly better in this fairly complex and character driven revenge western. Don't expect wall to wall action and shoot-outs because you will be disappointed. This is a thinking man's western with several themes explored through tremendous acting on the part of the cast. That being said about the film, let me just say that out of the seven to ten DVD versions available perhaps one or two are watchable. Why Paramount would not invest a little money into THE overlooked film of arguably our greatest American film actor is beyond me. Give the public a cleaned up print of this film and a little advertising based purely on Brando's reputation and they just might make some money off of it. As it stands the film will continue to be maligned and overlooked due to the atrocious DVD transfers that proliferate every video store and drugstore bargain bin. Good luck finding a good version. I watched it on the Diamond Entertainment version in letterbox and it was a fairly good transfer of an unrestored late 1961 film. It would be a wonderful thing to see this film restored with some of that lost million foot of footage Brando shot included in a DVD package. Ah but to dream. Brando deserves better.
