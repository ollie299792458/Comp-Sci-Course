Overall, this is an amazingly inspirational story, filled with beating the odds of rebuilding unity in a country rife with separation.  However, they failed at bringing the incredible moving story, the full stretch, to the screen.
This is a true story, based on Nelson Mandella becoming President of South Africa, and the decisions he made, specifically to support and promote the Rugby team, with the idea that it would help bring both sides of his country, blacks and whites, together for the first time.
I should have been blown away by this movie. I should have laughed and cried my heart out, and I'm not even into sports.  But I didn't.  This movie did not MOVE me, and I find that incredibly disappointing.
I found the writing lacking in delivering a script that brought, what must have been, such a dramatic turmoil to the screen. The characters were not well developed, nor was their portrayel, by very talented actors, believable. They seemed somewhat lifeless, which leads me back to the writer (of the script and perhaps the book, which I have not read), and the director.
The directing was at time confusing, especially on the rugby field, because it was hard to figure out what was going on.  A non-sports fan, should be able to watch a sports movie, and still understand what's going on.  I didn't have a problem understanding other sports movies, like The Natural, Coach Carter, Remember The Titans, etc. The final match, did not build up emotionally with the shots, major let down.  Also, the shots in the movie, weren't building up, heightening the emotion. I have never been particularly impressed with Mr. Eastwood's directioning, and this movie was no exception.  Of course, the writer didn't help either.
I agree with another Reviewer, who said the movie struggles to find itself, is it a sports movie or is it about President Mandella.
So, while it is a movie worth watching, based on the historical aspect, just don't except a heart pull like perhaps The Blind Side.
