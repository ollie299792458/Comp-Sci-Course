I have no experience with Ultraviolet, so I will just stick to the movie. Don't bother with this one. I really don't know what everyone saw in this movie. If I wanted to see Hangover, I would watch the original again, not a stale, copy placed in another country. Same settings and even lines as the first one, and they seemed to stretch scenes to help this piece of junk limp along. If youve seen the first one, you could anticipate the points of plot change in this one. Even same Kanye and Cash in the Soundtrack, really, they cant even change it up a little? I really like the first one, but I couldn't even finish this one, as I didn't care about it and I could pretty much guess how the last 30-40 min would play out. The jokes were to the point where I was looking at my girl wondering if I was missing something as there was silence between us(all of the funnier scenes were in the trailers, so if you saw that, don't go any further). No content, weak acting, humorless attempt; but just a horrible excuse to capitalize on a great first movie. Of course they would in this business, but I ended up leaving the room to finish my damn laundry...really! I borrowed this from a friend and I am so glad I didn't waste my time paying for this in the movies or on BR, cause I would certainly ask for my money back.  Show Hollywood that you expect more by avoiding this.
