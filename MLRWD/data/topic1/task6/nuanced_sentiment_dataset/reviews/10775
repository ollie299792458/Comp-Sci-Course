In a nutshell, a film stars management team (played by the Birdcage's Nathan Lane and Will &amp; Grace's Sean Hayes) creates a competition for someone to win a date with their star Tad Hamilton, in order to quash his bad press.
Kate Bosworth (from Blue Crush) wins, much to the jealousy of her best friends, played by Mona Lisa Smile's Ginnifer Goodwin, and Traffic's Topher Grace, which in turn creates a love triangle, when the film star (played by Josh Duhamel) falls for her, Topher's character having been in love with her for his whole life.
The film is charming, and well acted, especially by Bosworth and Duhamel who are both very believable.  The film is a fun but predictable romantic comedy, but it is ultimately flawed.
Problem 1: Tad Hamilton is charming, rich, successful, famous and a nice guy.
Problem 2: Tophers character is geeky and annoying.
You know the film is rooting for Topher to finally win the girl - but in my opinion Tads character simply wasn't nasty enough.  He makes a couple of mistakes, but ultimately I was left wanting her to stay with Tad.
You know how the film will end and you just want it to be different, leaving me unsatisfied.
However the film is fun, and I did enjoy it.  It's well acted, charming and sweet.
Special mention should go to the music, which I was constantly aware of throughout the film, especially `Shining' by Kristian Leontiou (I have since learned).
