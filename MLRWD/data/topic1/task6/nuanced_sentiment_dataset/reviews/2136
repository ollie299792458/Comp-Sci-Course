This is a review of the Peter Greenaway film "Prospero's Books".

When Tchaikovsky composes a  memorable piece with alternately agitated and romantic music,then caps it off with a dirge,and calls it "Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture", I can accept it as a beautiful and  completely successful work inspired by Shakespeare's play. The same goes  for Berlioz's "Romeo et Juliette",a "dramatic symphony"  in which significant moments of the play are represented by orchestral  music ,topped off by an entirely sung final scene which deliberately  resembles an opera ,and the same also goes for Verdi's  "Otello",in which the first two scenes of Shakespeare's play are  completely dropped in order to have a more dramatically effective opening  scene. But when a pretentious hack like Peter Greenaway concocts something  like this and presents it as a version of "The Tempest", I call  it arrogant presumption. Yes,the photography and set design are  impressive,and the images are unusual,but so what? Sir John Gielgud recites  nearly all the roles,and the other actors are mere window dressing. But  unless the viewer has literally memorized the play,it is virtually  impossible to figure out who is speaking or what is supposed to be  happening. Gielgud is assuredly a great actor,but even he is totally lost  here. It would be quite a different thing if he had been allowed to  differentiate his characterizations and literally "be" the  different characters. But he isn't even asked to do that-- he merely  recites Shakespeare's verse. The fact that Greenaway actually expects us to  take this as a valid interpretation of a Shakespeare play demonstrates  nothing but pure conceit. I could endure only about thirty minutes or so of  this trash before I switched to another channel (no,I didn't rent or buy  this-I wouldn't waste money on it.)
