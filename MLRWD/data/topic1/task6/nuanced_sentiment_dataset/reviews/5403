This is one of the better movies to enjoy as HD DVD version. The picture quality is stunning. 80% of the movie plays at night or in dark environment. That's when you see the difference to the standard DVD: Where the DVD version was murky and impossible to detect any details in dark areas, the HD DVD shines. I was able to see wall structures in finest detail and things like that add to the true movie feeling. I whish there were more HD DVDs like this one.

The sound is good, too. Even though the disk makes no use of the new audio standards for HD DVD, it still rocks. To my ears, it was not better than the DVD version, though. The surround effects are well placed and the subwoofer had plenty to do.

Yeah, I know I only talked about the tech aspect in this review; but HD DVDs are still scarse and early adopters are frankly more interested if the picture and sound quality is good. Believe it or not: Even if this was a really bad movie (and it isn't), most owners of HD DVD players would still watch it just to test their precious high tech home movie theatre.

If you read the other reviews it's clear: The movie IS good. Thank god. Unfortunately, there are only a few really good movies on HD DVDs out there and this is one of them.
