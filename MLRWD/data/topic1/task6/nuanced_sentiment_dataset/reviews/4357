I am utterly stunned by the negative reviews, although I do see all their points.

I found this film emotional and gripping.  I enjoyed a lot of the "insider" moments, for people familiar with the culture and references, it is interesting.  I liked the "blair witchyness" of the film as the first comment crushed the film for..

I did find the "secret" audio (the main characters wife calling from Tower I prior to its collapse) an anti-climax to the film.  This could have been revealed from the start.  I believe the back cover of the DVD case describes this as the motivation for the characters quest ~ why bother saving this?  Overall I found this film emotionally connecting, not only on a sadness level, but I felt irritated, annoyed, etc...by some of the actions of the characters, I would say this film has excellent acting.

I watched this gilm shortly after its dvd release, it was timely and touching.  I think this film-writer created a film which sought out the hunt so many families have wanted to personally take...

The characters truly seem geniune, and the irriation and annoyance they experience with each other, themselves and the entire search adds depth to the storyline.

I consider this one of my favorite films.
