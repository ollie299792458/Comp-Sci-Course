Another reviewer asked (and answered) some questions, to which I respond below.  First, I would like to say that Pretty in Pink is one of the best movies out of the Brat Pack opus.  It has it all, laughs, tears, good looking characters, and great music.  In sum, an all-around winner.

My answers to the following:

[Spoiler alert. Nothing overt, but I do touch on the ending indirectly.]

Burning questions for anyone who liked this movie:

Q. Why does Ringwald appear repulsed by Cryer the first time she sees him?

A. Because anyone that clingy is a bit repulsive.

Q. Why does Ringwald's best friend disappear halfway through the movie?

A. She died after the movie was finished.  Iona takes over as the mother that Andie needs at this point.  Jena is a friend.  Andie needs a mom.

Q. Speaking of Spader, why has he been chasing Ringwald for years if nothing about people outside of his social status appeals to him?

A. All rich boys like to slum, every once and a while...  don't you watch movies?

Q. Why are we supposed to think that Ringwald's perfectly decent house is trashy and shameful?

A. Because in comparison to Blane and Steph's houses, it is pretty shabby.  Besides, her dad is unemployed, sits around in his underwear and is  pretty embarassing to a 16 year old girl.

Q. Why in the novelization does Duckie get the leading lady and not in the movie?

A. Because in real life, any self-respecting girl in 1986 would have chosen Andrew McCarthy over Jon Cryer.

Q. Why, if the characters' emotions and actions are supposed to ring true, does Potts almost blind a customer with a staple gun?

A. Because it is a movie...

Q. Why, if Cryer and Ringwald are in the same grade and therefore presumably the same age, can't he get into the same nightclub she can?

A. Andie is cool and has a fake ID, whereas Duckie is a misfit who rides a bike.
