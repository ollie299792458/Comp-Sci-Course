We watched Iron Man 2 in the cinema but failed to capture the quality we were looking for so we were very excited to finally be able to see this again in the comfort of our home in high-quality blu-ray format. I think no one else can get away with playing Iron Man except for Robert Downy, Jr. so I hope to see him in the sequels, if any. Anyway, to those who are thinking of getting this, it's worth collecting and watching over and over again. That way, you can be sure to get your money's worth. You may also download your own digital copy onto your PC and take the movie with you when you travel. I'm from Manila, Philippines. The version that they're selling here comes only in 2 discs and is even more expensive. You see, blu-ray still hasn't caught the eye of the typical movie-goer or collector where I'm from, except maybe from those like me who are movie enthusiasts, that's why blu-rays come out to be quite expensive for the regular person. And I'm talking about both the players and discs. But if you're aiming for quality and pure viewing pleasure, then this is worth the purchase.
