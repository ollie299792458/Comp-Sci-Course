This is a movie I am itching to show to the medical students I teach.  The story of the first heart surgery (also the first pediatric heart surgery, just to make the accomplishment even more difficult) is put into context.  I won't summarize the movie other than to say that issues of race, class, and gender were very important in this pioneering operation and led to the neglect of one of the key persons, Vivian Thomas, played with subtlety and skill by Mos Def.  Dr. Blalock, played by the consistently excellent Alan Rickman, is portrayed neither as a do-good crusader or a black-hatted parasite but with the ambiguity and mental conflicts inherent in such an intelligent and ambitious character.  A long-overdue recognition of Thomas' contributions ends the film and it would seem hackneyed were it not strongly based on true events.

Must-see for medical students, medical educators, and anyone interested in how the socially privileged were gradually forced to acknowledge the contributions of talented people who had been excluded from the mainstream of medical education.
