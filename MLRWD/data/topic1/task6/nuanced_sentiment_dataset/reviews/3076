I went in to this with a desire to like it and a belief that I wouldn't, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Though the concept seems a little outdated (shouldn't this have come out 30 years ago?), the strong cast kept up my belief that it was dealing with timely issues.  Indeed, I think the movie had less to do with the idea that women need to be able to pay for a room of their own and more to do with the need for greater sisterhood and the ways that women keep each other from succeeding, which was definitely put across more subtly.  
 
The fact that it had a really good cast certainly helped it out.  Kirsten Dunst played the perfect b****, Julia Stiles the overachiever, and Maggie Gyllenhaal the s*** with a heart of gold, and though their plot lines were, for the most part, predictable, they carried their characters well and convincingly.  I liked Julia Roberts a lot more in this movie than I usually do, though her desire for support from Dominic West seemed both anachronistic with the ideas of the movie and something of a head scratcher.  Marcia Gay Harden played the saddest role in the movie very well if a little broadly, and even Tori Amos made a surprise appearance.  
 
Unfortunately, it was just a little bit unsatisfactory, perhaps because it reckoned back to such Goliaths as To Sir, With Love and, of course, Dead Poets Society, and failed to provide anything particularly new besides an all female cast.  Still, it was better than it was made out to be, and its message was perhaps more timely now than it would have been 10 years ago.  7 out of 10.
