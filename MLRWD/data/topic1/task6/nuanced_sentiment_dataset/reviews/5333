Here's my take on "The Ride and Fall of WCW".  While not WWE's stongest documentive effort, this DVD is still a very well rounded history of WCW.  What people seem to forget is that 80% of the what they say isn't covered in this DVD has already been covered in numerous other WWE releases (more on this later).  Had this footage been reused everyone would be complaining that WWE is trying to rehash the "Monday Night War" DVD.  Now that being said, the WWE aren't fools and why would they compile all the footage on one DVD when they can make you buy 5 more DVDs to get the full story?  Now does this make hardcore wrestling fans angry?  Yes and No.  Yes if you wanted all of your WCW history in one Box set, but most wrestling fans already own the other DVDs that I'm speaking of.  Now with that being said I agree with others in saying that there are some things that were brushed over (finger poke of doom) or not even covered at all (Hogan/Sting build up for Starcade etc.).  I was a huge WCW fan back in the day, well that is until they rebooted it into the mess that eventually killed it, and I know that WCW faithful were hoping for a little more than what was on this disc.  But let's face it had WWE made a WCW DVD that would have made everyone happy it would have been about a 4 1/2 or 5 hour documentary.  Not to say that I wouldn't have wanted that (in fact I do want that) but I guess WWE wanted to keep it at a family friendly 2 hour length.  All in all it's not a bad release but we were spoiled with "The Rise and Fall of ECW" set and expected more.  I would love to see someone create the ultimate WCW documentary using footage from theses DVDs and editing them together: The Monday Night War, NWO: Back in Black, Hulk still rules, Bret Hart's DVD, the 4 Horsemen, and the Starcade dvd.  If done properly it would cover 90-95% of what everyone is complaining is missing in this set.  Still this is a must have for hardcore WCW fans.
