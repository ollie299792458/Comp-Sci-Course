For the most part I enjoyed this remake and for the 1st hour or so the film exceeded my expectations.I think the Trailer Raid scene was the movie's high point and the rest of the film was a let down.

My biggest complaint however is what I first assumed a tribute to Chris Cunningham's short film "Rubber Johnny" may actually be a blatant ripoff.

For those unfamiliar with "Rubber Johnny" its a short movie about a deformed human confined to a wheelchair and forced to live in his parents basement. The Hills Have Eyes mutant "Big Brain" is nearly Identical to Cunningham's creation. Do a google image search for Rubber Johnny and see for yourself.

Like i said when I first viewed the movie I assumed the filmmaker's were tipping their hat to Cunningham, but after listening to both commentaries for the scene with no mention of Rubber Johnny or Chris Cunningham, i began to suspect the filmakers (or at the very least-the effects guys) were taking credit for "Big Brain's" creation. In one commentary the director mentions the movie "the changeling" as inspiration for "big brains" wheel chair.

Another instance in the movie, although much less blatant, borrows from Cunningham. The red hoooded mutant girl  has the same style of CGI morphing applied to her face as Cunningham's playstation commercial a few years back. This similarity alone probably wouldn't have bothered me if it weren't for the "big brain" scene.
