"The Company Men" is a sober telling of life within a modern company.  Men come to be defined by their jobs and when the job is taken away from them, they are lost.  Their world as they understand it simply collapses.

At a high level, "The Company Men" covers the lives of several executives of the ship building division of GTX Corporation, an American conglomerate.  Profitability and growth seems to be eluding the division and the only response of management is downsizing and, when this fails, more downsizing.  Each man is thrown into a whirlpool.  Their lives of debt and over-consumption come to a screeching halt.  If there is one message from this film it is that too many people assume that things won't change.  Too little attention is paid to saving for a rainy day.  Consumption is king.

There are excellent performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Ben Affleck.  Both end up being "let go" and both struggle with the consequences.  However, eventually, reality must be faced.  This is not an easy row to hoe.  In the case of Ben Affleck's character, his life style is forced to undergo big changes.  His house is sold, his family moves back to living with his parents, his wife gets a part time job and he takes a job of manual labour from his brother in law.

Without spoiling the plot, there is a somewhat happier ending.  However, in the meantime, the film gives an excellent portrayal of so much of modern corporate life.  It's a dog eat dog world out there.  Just remember that change can be forced on anyone.
