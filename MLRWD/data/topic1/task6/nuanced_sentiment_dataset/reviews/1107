I saw the movie four times as a boy around Charlie's age, but as an adult it's obvious now that the movie is a little campy (a dark comedy that's also a musical?); a little cheesey (they didn't bust the budget on sets); and a little kitschy.

It's Wilder's Wonka, though not entirely true to the book, that makes the movie.  He appealed to me as a child and still does as an adult.  He's a mixture of strong emotional attractions and strong dangers.  As an adult, you can appreciate the mixture more.  He has obvious depth, maybe even with a dash of melancholy.  He can be whimiscal at one moment (putting an overcoat into a vat of candy because the candy was too cold) and then quote Shakespeare the next ("Where is fancy bred...?).  You can imagine Johnny Depp's Wonka putting the overcoat into the vat of candy, but you can't imagine him quoting Shakespeare.

For young children, even though the movie is rated G, my advice would be that if a child is too young to read Dahl's book, then the movie probably isn't for him or her.  The "scarry" things in the movie happen for a reason, and they're supposed to make the children watching think.

As for adults, "A little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men."
