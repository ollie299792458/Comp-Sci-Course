On the heels of Season of the Witch (as inaccurate a vision of this era as I have seen), Black Death manages to be everything that its predecessor  was not. A group of knights are traveling to a village which has reportedly not been impacted by the plague AT ALL, to determine whether or not it is "protected" by a necromancer. If so, they are to return same to the bishop who commissioned them for judgement and execution. Along the way, they pick up a young monk who knows the area to guide them, discover one of their men shows signs of having contracted the plague, and run afoul of thieves who are obviously robbing any and all travelers for whatever they can get. Ultimately, they reach their destination and discover that the rumors appear to be, in fact, quite true. What is unknown is the identity of the necromancer and how the few soldiers should proceed against so many villagers.

I won't reveal certain twists and I won't give away any more of the plot than I already have. What I will say is that this is one good "tale". The kind The Brothers Grimm would be impressed with; and that any who watch it would do well to remember that a really good tale is neither about leaving, arrival or SPECIAL EFFECTS, it is about the journey. How men are changed by their journeys and about how not all of those changes are honorable or even life-affirming.

The Black Death, The Little Ice Age and The Inquisition were known as the dark ages and there is a reason for that name. This is a movie that is dark, cold, bleak and disturbing... just as it should be.

It is also well shot, well acted, well scripted, costumed and lit. Furthermore, it does not pander to the audience nor assume that we are, or are not, historians. In the end; it's just a well put-together film, one that is well worth seeing.
