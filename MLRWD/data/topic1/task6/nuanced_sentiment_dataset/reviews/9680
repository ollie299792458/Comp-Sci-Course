Every once in awhile a movie comes along that is truly different, truly fresh, and this movie was one of those.  It stars Eddie Murphy as a Detroit cop named Axel Foley and is packed with action, comedy, a great soundtrack, and great scenes.  The opening credits to Glenn Foley's "The Heat is On" are filled with a montage of Detroit street scenes that give a great flavor of Detroit, which will be juxtaposed with the glamour of Beverly Hills later in the movie.

The movie starts with Axel Foley negotiating the price of a semi truck full of cigarettes with a couple of mobsters.  When they are surprised by a couple of uniformed Detroit cops in a squad car, one of the mobsters starts up the truck and takes off with Foley hanging on for dear life to a chain hanging from the top of the truck.  This is one of the classicly funniest chase scenes ever done and ranks up with anything in the Blues Brothers.

Later Foley returns home after being chatised by his boss, Inspector Todd, played brilliantly by a real Detroit Detective named Gilbert R. Hill, only to find his friend from California in his kitchen.  Later, when Foley's friend is murdered, he does the only thing a true friend would do, take vacation and head to California to track down the killers.

The rest of the movie is a look at how a gritty cop from Detroit gets along in glamorous Beverly Hills and more importantly how Beverly Hills gets along with a gritty Detroit cop.

Eddie Murphy is brilliant as Axel Foley poking fun at Beverly Hills, and Judge Reinhold and John Ashton are equally brilliant as Beverly Hills detectives assigned to watch Foley to keep him from creating havoc among Beverly Hills' elite.  Along the way Bronson Pinchot almost completely steals the movie with an hilarious 5 minute part as a pretentious clerk in a swanky Beverly Hills art gallery.

All in all, this movie is a great two hours of entertainment that will leave you breathless, I can't recommend it enough.
