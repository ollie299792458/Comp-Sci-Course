I read the reviews of this movie and ordered it.  After watching the movie, I really felt like most of the reviews were misleading.  The back jacket of the DVD is a clearer description of the actual content of the film.  Its about a cannabalistic swamp creature that rapes a woman on her honeymoon night. She is totally passed out, so doesn't see anything.  The movie skips forward about 18 years and we have a young man going through changes in his body and mind.  The doctor's say he is dying.  The parents go after the man (creature) to try to find out the nature of their son's rare, genetic illness.  Eventually the whole family ends up in the town which is harbouring the secret of this creature.  Lots of bloody carnage ensues as the boy changes into his father's own image.  Now, even all of this, bizare as it is, could be deemed interesting.  I liked the idea of the ending, and the way they tied the story of the injustice to the man (creature) to the events in the town.  But the truth is, the movie wasn't what I expected.  I have a wide range of interest in horror films.  I enjoy 1980's made for TV movies, I loved Carrie, The Exorsist, Poltergeist, Fright Night and the more recent films, Sixth sense, What Lies Beneath, and The Others.  If you want to really enjoy yourself, order one of those films, or all of them.  They will not dissapoint you.  This one will.
