This movie was pretty good on a level of graphics and original storyline. If you are a big fan of the Final Fantasy games though, do not see this movie. It doesn't follow the games at all and you will be wondering why they even call this movie Final Fantasy. It has no relevence at all to the video games and fans of them will be wondering the whole time, What the heck is this?!?! It is all new characters and none of them have ever been seen before from the video games. The storyline isn't anything like the video games at all either. It is pretty much a whole different movie that just happens to have the name Final Fantasy in it.

So, if you haven't played the Final Fantasy video games, then this movie might be pretty good. If you have played the video games before and are a fan of them, then this movie will seem really bad, because it is not at all like the video games and is not what you are looking for in a Final Fantasy movie that is supposed to be based on them. If you are looking for a good Final Fantasy movie based on the games, rent Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children.
