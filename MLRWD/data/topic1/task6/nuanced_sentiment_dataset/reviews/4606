So, I have been listening to this soundtrack for a long time and enjoyed the music even before I purchased the movie (actually, that's what made me order it).  The tunes are catchy and the singing is great - especially for a musical that utlises kids.

The movie certainly has a bit of a 90s feel to it and is unique in the way that there weren't that many made for movie musicals in the 90s so it kind of stands alone.  It can't be compared to the musicals of the 'golden era' because it has its own style.

Christian Bale is one of the greatest actors of our generation and this shows in his developing years.  The quality and intensity of his acting has persisted from Empire of the Sun to Newsies and then onto classics like American Psycho.  He certainly shines in this movie and pulls of singing and dancing with style.

The other characters are fun and sometimes a tad corny, but that's what musicals are!

I highly recommend this for families with younger children to watch and also for the musical theatre fan.  Dancers can appreciate the movie too because of the vast amounts of choreography that has been placed in the movie, since the Director has a strong history in choreographing shows.
