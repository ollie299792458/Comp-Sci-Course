I rented this from Blockbuster and should have taken heed to my instinct to put it back on the shelf when I read the sticker proclaiming it to be a Blockbuster exclusive rental.

I was lured in by the cast and the art house feel.  Ten minuted into the film, however, I found myself wondering:  "is this it???".  I kept waiting for it to begin but it never did.  Jude Law and Natalie Portman were really the only interesting characters in the movie and their bits were so minute compared to the entirely lackluster Nora Jones that I kept wondering to myself if the rest of the cast would add this film to their shame list and forget they ever participated in this disaster.

As for the arthouse feel, think in terms of the cinemagraphic tricks used in music videos and video snapshots of subways in New York where everything seems purposely sped up and blurred for effect.  Now imagine an entire film of that.  It's exhausting.

As to be expected with such a gifted lead, though, there was some lovely music to keep me company throughout the numbing dialogue and impersonal directing.  Other than that, it's painful.
