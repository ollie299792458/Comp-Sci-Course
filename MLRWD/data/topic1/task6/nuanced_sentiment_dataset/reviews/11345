I know I am in the minority on this one, but that can't change the fact that I had laughed exactly two times by the time it was over.  I certainly expected an evening of "gut-busting" laughter when I sat down to watch it, considering every single person I talked to said it was one of the funniest movies they had ever seen.  However, as I continued to watch, I began to wonder if I was seeing the same movie everyone else saw.
Now, I do tend to favor a different type of comedy, namely the Christopher Guest movies "A Mighty Wind", "Best in Show" and "Waiting for Guffman", but there have been a decent amount of what one would call low brow comedies that I have enjoyed.  I liked the Austin Powers movies and "There's Something About Mary", I even liked "Half Baked" with all its stupidity, but "Old School" was just a dud.  The jokes and gags all had a oddly familiar feel to them, like I had seen them already many times over, and they had lost their appeal a long time ago.  Even the turn of events in the movie, with the cliched "mean dean of the college" and the against all odds ending didn't come off as funny but rather as tired and overused.
There really isn't much more to say about "Old School", I mean, it's not like it warrants an in depth analysis of its "plot". To me, it's just a movie that failed to do what it was supposed to do, namely making me laugh.
