I Recently purchased the toshiba HD-DVD player and this movie along with Phantom of the Opera. The Quality of this HD DVD was a real disappointment. Phantom looked great and FMJ not so good. Part of this reason is that older films usually never look as good (older film stock, degredation etc.) however, I did comparisions with the DVD release and the HD DVD only looked marginally better.  The HD DVD is in the HD widescreen format while the DVD is 4:3.

This does not mean that the widesceen version has more of the picture. In fact the opposite is true. The 4:3 DVD version shows the entire film negative while the Widescreen is cropped at the top and bottom. The effect is similar to zooming in the picture on a  widescreen TV from 4:3 to zoom 1.  When doing this with the DVD version the improvement of the HD DVD was obvious (as one would expect when zooming any picture) but apart from this (and slightly better sound quailty than the DVD) there is no reason to purchase this if you own the DVD.

As for the film itself, it is a masterpiece that stands up over time. The combat scenes showing the confusion of urban fighting are extremely well executed.
