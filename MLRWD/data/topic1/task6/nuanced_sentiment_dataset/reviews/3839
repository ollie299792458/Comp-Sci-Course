My mother-in-law wanted to see this movie because she heard it was "just as good as 'Pretty Woman.'" I'm not sure that is a recommendation but, nonetheless, my husband and I dutifully trekked off to the multiplex with her.
Our expectations were low, but we were pleasantly surprised. Yes, the movie is predictable. Many of the conflicts seemd manufactured and the misunderstandings central to the plot could have been cleared up easily, but then the movie would have been about 15 minutes long.
On the other hand, there were several funny lines, and Ralph Fiennes was charming and debonair in a part that didn't ask him to be much more than that. Stanley Tucci had some funny moments as the handler of Fiennes' character, a politician. Tyler Posey, as J. Lo's son, was precocious without being annoying.
In short, if you want to enjoy a couple of hours of escapist fare, you could do worse than "Maid in Manhattan." Just don't think too much or, like Cinderella's carriage at midnight, this movie turns into a pumpkin.
