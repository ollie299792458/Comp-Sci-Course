Flags of Our Fathers (2006): For a movie about the flag, Clint Eastwood does not wave it enough. After his death, the son of one of the six flag raisers on Iwo Jima, wrote a terrific book (read it) on which this movie is based. Three of the flag raisers later died in the fight on Iwo Jima and the remaining three were brought home for a bond tour. Before the movie, I knew the strategic reasons for taking Iwo Jima, the failure of the pre-landing bombardment, and the impossible task asked of the Marines. Still, the manner in which the movie skips back and forth between the interviews of the son in preparing for his book, the actual battle on the island, and the bond tour, left me confused.  Eastwood apparently wanted to make a movie about the futility of war, an up-to-date Paths of Glory, but to the American people, Iwo Jima will always be remembered as the highest example of valor. The movie should have alternated between the Marines on Iwo Jima and the three flag raisers at home on the bond tour. Their confusion and guilt over being called heroes while their friends were still dying would have given the movie a context that made it understandable to the viewer. The flag raising occurred four days after the landing, but the hard brutal fighting, basically Marines with rifles against entrenched positions, went on for three more weeks. We suffered 26,000 Marine casualties on Iwo Jima, one third of all Marine casualties in the Pacific war. 6,800 died, more than double the deaths in the Twin Towers and 27 men (22 Marines and 5 Navy corpsmen), won the Medal of Honor, of which one half were posthumous. Eastwood thinks the loss of 20,000 Japanese is due to some equivalent concern, apparently shared by some of the reviewers who look forward to seeing Letters From Iwo Jima.
