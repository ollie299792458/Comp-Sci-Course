Some will justify this picture because of the late Heath Ledger, and all the other top billing actors haphazardly thrown in the mix.  Others will rave how 'weird' it is (not realizing that weird does not equal random/pointless), and therefore how enlightened they are for appreciating an 'art film'.  How amazing the effects are.  I'll admit I was intrigued from the trailer and after hearing of Tom Waits' character.  I am just glad I waited to rent it, instead.  This was seriously, some of the most painful movie viewing I've sat through in some time.  There's movies that are so bad they are good, those categorized as cult, weird, out there, bizarro, blah blah blah... this does not fall into any of those arenas.  Aside from Waits' intermittant appearances as the devil, which were comical and fresh, the rest just stink stank stunk.  It's a classic case of less ideas, more money (aka Hollywood); and to justify weak storytelling, we'll just chuck on more CGI, more big name actors/actresses, and more plot openings, the further down the drain the story sinks.  A few scenes were well designed, and give credit to the creative work behind the carriage that unfolds into the "Imaginarium".  However, the fun stops there.  In fact, by the time one character runs up with a broken arm (we're closing in on the 2-hour mark by now), I was begging out loud, "oh god not another pointless side story, please don't squeeze in a 15 minute hospital scene, PLEASE NO!!!"... thankfully, I was spared of that much.  I've seen high school plays half as long with more talent and better storytelling.  Carnival sideshows that delivered more on the barker's promise to entertain and mystify.  This was a 2-hour empty trip to nowhere with lots of pretty colors.  To quote the movie itself, "I think I'd like my money back!"...
