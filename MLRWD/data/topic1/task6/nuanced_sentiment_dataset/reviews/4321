An Oscar worthy indie film, one of the greatest alternative musicals in film history. Based on the stage play of the same title, the story follows the life of Hansel; who adopts his mothers' name Hedwig following a botched sex-change operation in order to escape the musically and sexually repressed East German state.  Hedwig follows his/her life in search of love, finding only disappointment and betrayal, from an American GI to her protege Tommy Gnosis. In the search for love, Hedwig finds not only its' origin, but its' destination as well.  Steven Trask gives the film its' soul in his musical compositions as well as lending his voice to the character of Tommy Gnosis. John Cameron Mitchell directed and stars as Hedwig showing a range of talent that it is hoped will be displayed in future stage and film work. Miriam Shor shines as backup vocalist  Yitzhak. Finally, Andrea Martin gives a performance that backs up her standing as one of the great comedians of our time.  All four of these performers deserve Oscar consideration one of the truly innovative film muscials of recent memory. Certainly the songs "Wicked Little Town" and "The Origin of Love" should be considered for Best Song.  This film isn't for everyone, and does have its uneven moments. The ending may leave you scratching your head, but is ultimatly satisfying with reflection. See it twice and add it to your video library when it's available. You won't soon forget this film!
