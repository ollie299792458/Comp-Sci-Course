Boyz'N the hood is a very memorable movie, remember watching it when it first came out, recently I decided to add it to my DVD collection. Actors Cuban Gooding J.R. (Trey), Lawerence Fishburne (Furious), Ice Cube (Dough Boy), Nia Long, Morris Chestnut (Ricky) deliver a very moving and powerful movie. John Singleton gets directing credit for this amazing movie. As some have already said this is not a gangster movie, this is a movie about growing up poor in South Central LA, and the survival needed to make it, its also about the relation between a father and his son (Trey &amp; Furious), and about two of Trey's friends who have no father, brothers Ricky and Doughboy- one the rising football star, the other the local hood. To there mother, one can do no wrong, and the other is always in the wrong. Movie has some really positive moments, one of my favourites is when Trey and his pops are riding in the car, and listening to Five Stairsteps "Ooh Child" a classic soul song. Another thing that makes characters stand out is watching them develop from boys to men. Tragedy strikes in the movie, and Trey goes to look for revenge, then stops himself coming to realization that thats not the choice he wants to make in life. "Boyz 'N the Hood" is a good movie, that will keep you captivated from start to finish.
