Fact #1: This is one of the worst movies ever made. Period.

Fact #2: Anyone who thinks this is a good film has a walnut-sized brain. Sorry... it's not funny, it's not scary, it's a very poorly made movie. In one of the behind the scenes extras, Danny McBride made a comment about one of the scenes as "feeling a little flat". He knew.

Fact #3: The reviewer below who let his 5 and 9 year-old watch this movie should have his kids taken away by Child Protection Services.

Fact #3: This is NOT a movie adaptation of the classic and beloved TV series from the 1970's. The LOTL theme presented here is merely a zany vehicle for Will Farrell to do his usual "shtick". The same as back in his SNL days only without actually being funny.

Fact #4: This director sucks... the script sucks... Syd and Marty Kroft should be holding their heads in shame for defacing their own legacy. However, the CGI effects are pretty decent and Chaka amd the T-Rex is the most entertaining character in the film (niether are human) so it is truly a shame that this production wasn't taken more seriously. Just because a movie has dinosaurs or monsters in it doesn't mean that the acting and screenplay has to be sub-standard. In the end, you just get a lousy movie. Even the great Steven Spielberg is guilty of this heinous crime.

Fact #5: Universal should be indicted for perverting this classic sci-fi TV series. Those of us who grew up with the TV show know that despite its low-budget cheesiness, it expanded our imaginations and was way better than the crap kids have to watch today - ultra-violent video games and mind-numbing cartoons. But the last laugh is on the air-head suits at Universal! They could have had a huge hit and a franchise here! LOTL 2: Attack Of The Sleestak, LOTL 3: The Revenge Of Enid, ect... But unless this piece of crap goes OOP, it ain't gonna happen folks ~
