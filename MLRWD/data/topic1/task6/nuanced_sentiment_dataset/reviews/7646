Green Lantern has always been one of my all time favs since childhood, I waited anxiously for this release... just to be let down.  Maybe it's because I'm a huge fan but I was let down in every aspect of this movie.  Bad voice acting & horrible story are the big two.  I really didn't like any of the voice choices for the characters at all.  None seem to fit.  The story was really subpar.  It was like a bobo mix of all the GL origin stories told... only not as detailed in that story.  The action and mission starts right away.  Now that isn't always a bad thing but in this instance, I didn't care for it.  If you're a giant GL fan then you may be disappointed in this.  I actually enjoyed the Duck Dodgers episode "The Green Loontern" (on the bonus disc) better than the actual feature.  My review may be a bit vague, but I get frustrated just thinking about it.

But don't just take my word for it.  Check it yourself.  If you wanna see a good DC animated feature, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LK8SQ6">Wonder Woman 2009 (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy)</a> or if you really wanna see GL rocking it, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PFSYO4">Justice League - The New Frontier (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>
