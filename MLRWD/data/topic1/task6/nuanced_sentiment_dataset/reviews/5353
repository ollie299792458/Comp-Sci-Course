The movie Total Eclipse starring Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the most briliant i've ever laid eyes upon!!!!
It's a little darker than usual for him but, that just shows off his versitality! He's not just a Romeo anymore!!!!!!!!!
He is one of the best actors i've ever seen in any movie at any age!
  The movie itself is quite the masterpeice! It has love, hate, comedy, passion, and realism. True human emotions in a story of a real human being who was quite the brilliant poet and lover of life!
Born with a special gift he used only for a short while but, nevertheless immortalized him in literature!
I commend Leonardo for his performance in this film! Brilliant acting with a bit of an in your face sence to it! Not many actors could pull off a roll such as this with as much class as he did!
Stepping out from a conventional type cast roll is a major acheivement for any actor and he did it superbly!!!!!!
The relationship between these two poets is somewhat hard for me to grasp as they were like night and day but, as they say "opposites attract".
I am in no way condoning homosexuality or bi- sexuality but, then again i'm in no position to condem it either? It's part of the story and therefore part of the films charm!
I'd recommend this film to anyone with enthusiasm and hope you all appriciate it's truth as much as i do!
If you are a lover of the strange or poetry, arts and artists then you should enjoy this film emmensily! If not ... then you'll enjoy watcing the change in Leonardo's character. If none of the above then oh well, i tried!
Only one last thing to add.....
BRAVO LEO!!!!!! JOB WELL DONE!!!!!!1
