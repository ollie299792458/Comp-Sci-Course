The film reminds you of some 1950s film where the plot is being written as the actors are being filmed.  The plot is thrown togather with one scene having little to do with the next.  It looks like the film had twelve different directions and the editor tried to put something togather out of ten hours of unrelated clips in an attempt to made up some kind of story.  The ending is particularly bad.  Dad decides to sacrifice himself but not save his doomed daughter while leaving his young son alone for life (his mother has already abandoned him).  BUT as the film ends here comes the last remaining creature who apparently is going to kill the youngster. Does he or does he not?  We will never know, as the credits then roll.  Remind you of a 1950s SciFi film where the monster is killed but in the final scene before the fade, there is an egg cracking releasing yet another monster. OOOOOOOO!  We can pray that this is not an open door for a sequel.  Costner came under unfair fire for Waterworld and The Postman, but they are Citizen Kane compared to this.  On the positive side, the acting was quite good, as was the image quality and sound.  But like Fonzie once said on Happy Days, it is like ketchup and ice cream.  Seperate they are thumbs up but togather?  The parts of the this film do not add up to a whole.
