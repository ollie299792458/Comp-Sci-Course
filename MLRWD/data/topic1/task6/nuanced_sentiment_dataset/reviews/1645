This is the simple solution America does not want. It is time for people to show some initiative in taking charge of their own health. The healthcare system as we know it won't be there as it is in 20-30 years. Take care of yourself now and you will be healthy then. I became an 'accidental vegan' after I saw Rip Esselstyn on the Today show and then read his book 'Engine 2 Diet.' I have been a vegan for over two years. I am now 52 years old. I have read 'The China Study' by Dr. Campbell and 'How to Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease' by Dr. Esselstyn and I have Dr. McDougall's cookbooks. I will never go back to eating animal products because I feel too good.

The film was very informative, educational, however, I am already a believer in plant based nutrition. America has such a fascination with animal foods, and unfortunately most people won't listen until they are too sick. I definately recommend the movie and the books of these researchers and clinicians. You will save your live and yourself.
