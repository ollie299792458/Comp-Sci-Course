*SO* many other people have written about how awful this movie is, so what's another voice thrown into the fray?

Here is why I rented it: I love John McTiernan movies.

I got the special edition of "Predator" for Christmas and enjoyed the commentary; especially when McTiernan says that he just likes to make popcorn movies that people enjoy (cases in point: "Die Hard" and "Predator"). Now, granted these two movies are pure popcorn, no one can deny that they are also great action movies that completely incorporate characterization and action.

So, for this reason, and the great cast including Jean Reno (who rocked out in "Ronin") and even Naveen Andrews (anybody recognize him as the sikh from "The English Patient" other than me?), I plopped down my rental fee and took the movie home.

They owe me two hours of my young life back!

*SO* many things are horrifically wrong with this movie, I'll just describe my biggest beef about it: there is about a 20 minute sequence--which, unfortunately, is essential to the pithy plot-- which was shot in NIGHTVISION; all grainy and green. I have *no* idea what was going on in McTiernan's head, I don't want to know.

I have never seen the original, but as I understand it the original story takes place in the future, which would at least be more appropriate. As a student of Russian history I take *MAJOR* issue with the producers and the director keeping it in contemporary times and just putting it half way around the world. It all seemed disjointed and forced and lame.

There should definately be an option on this reviewer system for NO STARS, I feel guilty dignifying it with one.
