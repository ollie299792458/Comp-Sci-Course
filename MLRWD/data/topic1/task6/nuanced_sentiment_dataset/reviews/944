Will Smith's performance is incredible, as is his canine companion. But I Am Legend falls victim to two things plaguing Hollywood these days:

- Overreliance on CGI: This movie would have been much better served using live actors than CGI. The "uncanny valley" phenomenon is epitomized in this film, and the reliance on computer imaging takes away from the experience.

- Bittersweet ending: Those who have read Richard Matheson's novel know that there is no bittersweet ending involved. Instead, the movie took a turn for the worse in the second half with the introduction of a seemingly useless character who serves only as a plot device. The holes punched into the storyline by her addition show the absurdity of changing the original plot.

This is worth a rental, but ultimately I walked out of the theater disappointed by the second half of the movie. My wife and I both suspect, because of the glaring difference in quality between the two halves, that another set of writers took over for the second half. Walking out of the theater on a bad note is the worst way to render a movie!
