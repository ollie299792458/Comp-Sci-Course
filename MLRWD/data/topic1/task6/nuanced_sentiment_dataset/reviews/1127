This is an awesome show and Season 4 is a great season. Unfortunately, it is met with poor audio and video quality on blu-ray. The problematic transfer and lackluster audio is only truly enough to knock a point or so off of the final score, but these discs are marred with other issues. From a good distance you won't notice how bad the video quality is anyway. This set would be worth adding to your collection, except for one fact: the discs are defective and do not play nice with Playstation 3s. It's not just older 1st generation PS3s that are the problem either. These discs don't want to play on my 160gb phat PS3 from 2009.

It's mostly disc 3 that is the problem. I have to disable my network connection and repeatedly press the start button when the disc first loads up to get it to play instead of returning me to the PS3's XMB menu. The other discs have done the same thing but to less of an extent; and there have been other problems as well. Sometimes certain audio tracks don't work. For instance, once there was no dialogue but there were other sounds; and once the background music was louder than the dialogue and everything else. Please, for the love of whatever god you pray to or don't pray to, do not buy this on blu-ray if you intend to watch it on a PS3. You've been warned!
