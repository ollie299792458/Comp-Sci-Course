Growing up I have found there aren't many films that can last a long time any more. But this one is a true classic. Near enough 20yrs and this film still does it for me. As soon as I saw the dvd I had to go and buy it! I can never get bored of this film, I will show it to my children's children cos that's how good it is. Eddie Murphy did so well on this one along with Arsenio Hall, John Amos (McDowells, what a loser lol!) and all the other actors. I don't think anyone had a weak moment in this film and the jokes are just too much e.g. SEXUAL CHOCOLATE!! lol! Whoever wrote and performed that Soul Glo tune needs to meet me cos I'd like to shake their hand HAHAHA!

One thing I loved about this film is that although Prince Akeem obviously had to adjust to American culture (what does dumb f*** mean?), the writers didn't make his character look overly dumb like other films I have seen. Prince Akeem was intelligent and knew how to study people even though he was in a different culture.

If I could I'd give this more than 5 stars but I guess you get the point from my and other people's positive reviews. So now that you like my review go get this. You'll be glad you did.
