I have to admit after looking thtough these reviews of this film, especially since there were so many written by people who supposedly are involved in the scene, I am hugely dissapointed. This movie is not only a joke as a film, but a sorely depressing step backwards in trying to inform many people about a culture that they don't understand. To start with the film itself, technically this film is almost laughable from beginning to end. As a fellow cinematographer and longtime veteran of the party scene, the visuals were a complete travesty. And the dvd includes a commentary track by him, although I have no idea why. The cinematographer along with Greg Harrison show that they obviously know nothing about how a real underground warehouse party looks, or the vibe and soul that the culture breathes. And despite what another reviewer said... if you're loking for a truer visual representation of the scene, then go rent GO...., which has a much truer sense of the visual style. And This movie went to Sundance....AHHHHHH!!!!Doesn't anyone else see a problem with this movie? And another thing, I seriously doubt that at a warehouse party with about a hundred people there.. that John Digweed is going to show up... Yeah keep dreaming candy kids. The plot is completly disinteresting, with carboard cut out characters with inane kidlike dialouge left to describe the scene to people who are unfamiliar with it. This film is just a vehicle for Greg Harrison to showcase his connections within the scene, and Digweed, shame on you for involving yourself with such a shoddy production. Someday a good film will be made about the scene that does justice to it, and I hope that people involved in the scene worldwide will show their objection to being portrayed in a kidlike shoddy film that doesn't even get the candy culture right.. come on and how hard is that... I hope that Greg Harrison is not pursuing this any further because you failed, right off the bat..
