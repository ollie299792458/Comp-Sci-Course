This video is not intended for someone who has not or will not play the game. There are certain elements with holes that may leave the viewer in wonder. Also, from what I've read, this video's story was written prior to the official release of the game; because of this, there are elements that actually contradict the story of the game. An example that sticks out in particular is the video shows the marker being black - it is actually red (and the scale of the marker in the video is ambiguously larger than it really is). Also, the necromorphs are not afraid of the marker, but the video portrays it otherwise. Finally, the video shows the primary source of infection is the flying bat things - in the game story, that is only one of the forms of spreading the infection.

All-in-all, the video is definitely a good addition to the Dead Space story; however, those who have followed the story have to accept this video with a grain of salt and forgive it for it's inaccuracy in certain elements.
