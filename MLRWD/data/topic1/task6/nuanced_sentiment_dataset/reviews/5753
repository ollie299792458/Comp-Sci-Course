I can truly say that I didn't enjoy this film. I was looking for something to give me an insight on the life of this mad man. It never showed his childhood up bringing, and how he became so insane. It also left out all of the gore.What's the point of making a film about this Horror if you're not going to include what  really happened? I remember reading newspaper clippings of the murders and the things he would do to the bodies, And it was really horrible. This film tries to make the viewer see him more as a pervert, than letting you see the evil that lived inside of him. From the court cases when he was caught to the cannibalism he endured. All of that would have made this film a well done version of his life. The reason I gave this film some stars is that I did appreciate the fact that it showed you a little insight on his relationship with his father and grand mother.And the actor who played him did an excellent job of making him seem very eerie and at the same time human. Overall don't rent or buy this movie if you're looking for a detailed view of his life and tragic ending. you're better off waiting for the E true Hollywood story.
