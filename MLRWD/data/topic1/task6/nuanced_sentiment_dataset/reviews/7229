Elizabeth Goudge wrote some outstanding novels for adults and children.
Of these, one of her best is "The Little White Horse", a whimsical blending of Dickens, Grimm, Austen, Grahame, and others. Great food. Heroic animals. Often very funny. Also mysterious and haunting. Sentimental, and moral, but exactly right.
The film "Secret of Moonacre" has as much to do with the original Goudge book as the Shirley Temple version of "Heidi" has to do with the Spyri original.
Obviously some people enjoy the film.
I happen to prefer the book.

Happily, because the film chose to use a different title, there should be scope for a remake, under the original title, sticking faithfully to the proven elements of the book.
If Emma Thompson can script a faithful, beautiful version of Austen's "Sense and Sensibility", then it is feasible that someone of that calibre and sensitivity could script a faithful film-version of "The Little White Horse".
Until then, I will go on re-reading the book, while crying out for a faithful remake!
