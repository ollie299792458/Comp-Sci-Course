I originally saw "Dune" many years ago, in the late 1980s, as a network television broadcast.  I understand that this is the Alan Smithee version which was not approved by David Lynch.  Nonetheless, the "extended version" as shown on TV included some important scenes not seen in the 137 minute DVD & Blu-Ray editions.  Chief among these is the knife fight between Paul Atreides and Jamis (the Fremen).  It's a critical look into Fremen society and the martial rules of honor that guide them.  Fans of the book will also recognize it as a key step in the psychological and social development of the character Paul Atreides.  Otherwise this version of the film is very good.  Any limitations in the image quality of the Blu-Ray I would attribute to the age of the source material.  I do have some criticisms of the the scenes during the Harkonnen attack on Arrakis (at the beginning of the film) and the Fremen assault on the Emperor's frigate (at the end of the film).  The action is a bit a choppy.  It seems obvious that some portions were cut out (without finesse).  So there are a few scenes that just don't flow smoothly together.  It's probably not a problem for fans who have not seen the extended TV version.

The "Deleted Scenes" bonus feature is quite welcome.  Raffaella De Laurentiis explains that the raw footage encompassed about four hours of video.  Of course, this is simply too much for a movie feature.  Even a raw glimpse into the deleted scenes will show us that the film tried to remain true to the novel upon which it was based.  Fans of the book will recognize all of the deleted scenes.  It's a pity that an uncut version was never produced.  Given the flexibility of the Blu-Ray format, it would have been nice to see multiple versions of the film (even if it required a multi-disc release; I would have paid extra).
