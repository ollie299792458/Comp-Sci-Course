My mother took me to see Camelot in 1969 at the age of 11.  I absolutely fell in love with Richard Harris as King Arthur. There have been many King Arthur's that have come and gone, but none with the passion, yet sadness the Mr. Harris put into it. The scenery and the costumes were amazing and the storyline was wonderful. It truly let your imagination run wild. A movie like this could not be made today because there are no four letter words, no obscenities, so what would be the point in going? I truly wish more kids could see the broadway musicals that I was lucky enough to be brought up on. Gigi, Can Can, Oliver, My Fair Lady and so many more. You must see this movie and truly enjoy the actors/actresses. Vanessa Redgrave was amazing and so beautiful as Guinevere. Lancelot was the ultimate knight and you wanted to Kill Mordred! David Hemmings was soooo evil. I hope this helps. And by the way, April 24, 1987, my dream came true. I met Richard Harris. He was wonderful and charming and so funny. No one can tell a story like him. Camelot, to this day, is my all time favorite movie!
