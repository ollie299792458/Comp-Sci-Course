Maybe it's because I loved the book enough to buy IMAX tickets weeks in advance and stand in line for 2 hours for prime seating.  Maybe my expectations were a bit high.  But I found this movie to be terribly disappointing.

It's as though the director sought to cover every chapter in the 800 page book in 2 hours.  The result was a lot of fast-paced nothingness.  The characters we love became two-dimensional because didn't have enough time to develop any believable emotional response.

The director's desire to include as much of the book as possible resulted in the omitted scenes appearing even more obvious.  For example, Ginny spoke almost five words throughout the whole movie, despite being in half the scenes.

Finally, as the movie was about to end, we come to the first real action scene: the battle in the Ministry of Magic.  What should have been a dramatic battle, with dueling and new spells we've never heard of, was short and too quickly resolved.  Isn't this what the whole book was leading to?  This great battle?  What about all the wonders of the Department of Mysteries we witnessed in the book?  Unfortunately, there was no magic in this movie.

PROS: Performances by Helena Bonham Carter, Gary Oldman, and Evanna Lynch brought life into the otherwise dismal plot.

CONS: The plot was rushed and uneventful; Characters were two-dimensional.
