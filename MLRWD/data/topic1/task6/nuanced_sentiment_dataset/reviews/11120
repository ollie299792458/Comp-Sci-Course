It should be a huge red flag when the writer-director of a gay film is also playing one of the leads....and the other lead is twenty years younger than him.  This film was hilarious at moments, but I'm sure not at the moments Paul Bright expected to be amusing.  Bright's acting was the bottom of the barrel in a barrel full of bad actors.

Also, it is nearly impossible to believe that Paul Bright was only 41 when this film was shot.  He looks mid-fifties....and a very ragged mid-fifties at that.  I guess writing roles like this for himself in movies is the only way he get anywhere near a younger hot guy.  And the gratuitous scenes of his naked ass are absolutely unnecessary.  One last note....you'd think the writer and director of a movie would know enough to not look directly at the camera....but he did it several times!

If you want a cringe-inducing laugh, go ahead and watch this drivel.  Or just fastforward to get a nice shot of Thomas Romano's ass....there are many.  Or you could just go buy one of his porn movies.  I don't doubt he has done quite a few.
