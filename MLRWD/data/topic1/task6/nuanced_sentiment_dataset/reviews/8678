First of all, the DVD I bought does not have English subtitle. It has only Chinese subtitle even though it speaks Mandarin. So, it's very hard for us to completely understand the movie because we know only a little bit of Cantonese.

The fighting scenes are thrilling. The costumes are beautiful.The ending is extremely depressing because the Empress lost all the people she cared for - her lover and loyal followers. There's one scene that is very touching. It's when the Empress let go of her enemies after defeating them. She did not kill them because she wanted to live in peace with them as neighbors. It's an exceptional kindness. It makes this movie different from others of the same kind.

There's one scene that is so illogical that I don't like it. It's when Donnie Yen, all by himself, attacked a group of hundreds soldiers. He tried to kill the general within the group but of course ending up getting killed. A normal general would have run away and took revenge at another time.

It's still worth seeing once for curiosity.
