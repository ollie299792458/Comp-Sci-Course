Well, when the story begins, the Enterprise-B is being launched with Starfleet heroes, Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov. For me, it would have made more sense to have Spock and McCoy, but once Leonard Nimoy dropped out because of problems with the script, DeForest Kelley decided they had a better exit in The Undiscovered Country, and said "If Leonard's not doing it, then I'm not doing it." Well, anyways, these scenes set us up for the rest of the movie, which really has nothing to do with the original series cast.

On the whole, Generations seems like a drawn-out, higher budget episode of The Next Generation. However, fans familiar to the series may be surprised to see some set changes, such as added consoles on the Enterprise-D bridge, or the bright orange lighting in Ten Forward. For villains, Malcolm McDowell brings out the character of Soran, and the Duras sisters from a few episodes of TNG appear.

Anyways, I am one of the people who feel a bit more possitive about the ending (On the DVD, they show the original - not that good). Star Trek: Generations will be most appealing to Trekkers, but it is not as good an exit for the original cast as Star Trek VI.
