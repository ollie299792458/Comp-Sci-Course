Somehow Kurosawa always manages to imbue his films with an artistry that surpasses the often straightforward (but not simplistic) plots.  The Hidden Fortress is no exception.  Apparently an inspiration for George Lucas in his Star Wars film (though the similarities are slight), this sees Toshiro Mifune in another heroic role as he attempts to smuggle a princess across the border with the aid of two squabbling peasants (memorably played by Kamatari Fujiawara and Minoru Chiaki).
It's an entertaining, engrossing adventure, with Toshiro Mifune's stoic general butting heads against the peasants (and the princess) at every turn.  Fujiawara and Chiaki pretty much steal every scene they're in, with their bickering and squabbling and amazing amount of greediness shining through at every opportunity.  The black and white cinematography is gorgeous, there's ample doses of humour, a standout fight scene - what else could you ask for?  Sure, it doesn't have the majesty of Seven Samurai, the depth of Throne Of Blood or the black humour of Yojimbo, but The Hidden Fortress is nonetheless another example of why Kurosawa remains one of the greatest directors in history.
