This set is a very nicely done DVD set.  There are not a huge amount of extras, and the lack of commentary will probably annoy die-hards, but this is a good DVD set.  The episodes look great and this is probably the best that they have ever looked.  Unless you have a Blue-Ray DVD player, a 1080p TV and 60/60 eyesight, you will probably not notice any difference if you hold out for Blue-Ray.

Overall, the only reason that this did not get 5 stars is because the packaging is not the greatest.  I've bought all three of the remastered seasons, and 2 of them have had some type of problem.  Season 1 had a broken plastic case, and this set had a busted up DVD holder.

Otherwise, it's great to see how well this show has held up over the past 40 years.  I remember watching these on WPIX, NY and thinking that they were pretty good when I was a kid.  They look really good with the new effects, which hasn't changed the feel of the show at all, IMO.  To date, this is the most complete way to get the original series of Star Trek and you should enjoy it.
