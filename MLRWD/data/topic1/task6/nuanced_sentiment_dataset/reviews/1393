Success of any movie is the ability of you to get involved into it..and by that metrics, this movie comes up in flying colors.Everyone will like the movie ( irrespective of whether u are opinionated or not) since everyone of us have a 'noble'heart within us and we all crave for such 'true heroics' in life. The movie is very successful in evoking those qualities within us.. I could not see any actors in the movie..all i saw was a General Manager of a hotel  who is scared..yet who just can't stand murder and cruelty ..who wants to do something  about it with all odds against him.

I am one of those billions who is(was) indifferent of the plights of Africa..be it HIV/Genocide/Poverty etc..After watching the movie, was disturbed for quite a while. The best scene in the movie is the general manager crying in the room after driving back thro a road littered by corpse. and the  bad portion of the movie is the search for his wife's brother and brother in law and finding the kids at the end..Needless distraction in this classic masterpiece!
