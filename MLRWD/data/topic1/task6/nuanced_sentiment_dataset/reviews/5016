This is simply a great film by a great master! I first saw this on TV when I lived in Hawaii decades ago. It was the first Kurosawa film I had seen that was set in modern times. I was impressed at how well he directed such a "contemporary" (1960s)film. There are two major parts to this piece but there are strong moral dilemmas that flow through them both and unite them into a coherent whole. Part one is a highly charged drama that sets up part two. Gondo (Toshiro Mifune) is beset by two life-shattering choices that drive the action. He is forced to confront himself, and take stock of where he came from, how he got to the pinnacle of success, and how low he would go to stay there. Mifune gives a bravura performance, but everybody in the cast is superb. The suspense and tension build to the breaking point and culminate in one of the most moving scenes in cinema. The second part is a detective story that presages "Law and Order" and CSI in the way it details police practices. It also leads the viewer through some of the seamier urban flesh-pots of the time, and culminates in a final riveting scene that delivers the knock out combination punches of the film. This social message is as true today as it was in 1963, and is a caution that all societies should heed! The bonus disk that came with this package is truly worthwhile and gives invaluable insights into the actors and the way Kurosawa directed. This film had such an impact in Japan, that the laws regarding kidnapping were actually stiffened. Kurosawa is arguably the greatest film director of all time. He is also a great story teller.
