ok..here goes...this movie was on tv the other day...now granted i saw it when it first came out at the theater..and i noticed they left out a scene on the tv...AND in the other dvd releases(special edition,metal case,2 snaps-up edition,whatever). this movie IS a good movie...a lot of fun,just check your brain at the door and enjoy...BUT,does anyone  remember the scene coming near the end where the little boy and girl admitted they were scared AND HUGGED??? i remember it in the theater...twice actually...as did at least 9 friends and 2 ex girlfriends. why did the company who put this movie out,cut that scene from all dvd's? are they trying to send a message? dont wanna see a little black boy/white girl hug cause it might raise some concern for the future of everybody actually getting along? come onnnn...it was innocent...two kids scared...that's all. please let me know people,am i over-reacting? no,i'm not racist in any way,or pro white or pro black or pro any other color...i like everybody and everyone..till ya get on my nerves..lol. WAIT..just the other day,MSN has a list of movies on it's home page that were,i'll word it differently,"kinda touchy" to "the people". it was the movie "airplane",the scene where the boy walks up to the girl(both white) and offers her a cup of coffee..she accepts,he asks "cream or milk"? she says "no thanks,i take my coffee black,just like my men"...that part was FUNNY...all good fun.yet,THAT part is left out of some dvd releases as well...WHY?????? are the companies that scared of what "lines" or images" might put seep into peoples heads????? pitiful i say. "independence day and airplane"...two good movies,yes they are...but i cannot buy them...knowing what i know...thanks for reading if you've made it this far.
