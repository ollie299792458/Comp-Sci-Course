The gypsy life has been a part of romantic folklore throughout history. Their strong characters, colorful clothing, and nomadic lifestyle, paint a fascinating picture for the staid communities of our society. This movie supports that frame of mind in a most unexpected and refreshing way.

The movie revolves around a mysterious woman who moves from town to town in the rurals of France, with her young daughter and cremated mother. Like a gypsy, she owns only a few things which she can pack up and carry with her wherever she goes. At the beginning of the movie, she and her daughter relocate to a quaint little village near a river. She sets up shop in the town square and goes about making the most amazing chocolate confections, using her mother's secret recipe, and selling them to the locals.

Then along comes a handsome young man sailing down the river, with a guitar slung over his shoulder. A gypsy in his own right, he moves from town to town along the riverbank, staying long enough to make a little money and stock up for his journey forward.

When Music meets Chocolate, it is love at first sight! The chemistry between Depp and Binoche grows ever stronger with scenes of necking on a houseboat in the moonlight, and images of floating candle lanterns, stormy weather, and arson. Nostalgia overcomes you as the innocence and sensuality of an older era comes to life on screen.
