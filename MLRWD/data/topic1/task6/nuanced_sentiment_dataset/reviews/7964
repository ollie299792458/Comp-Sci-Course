"Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell" was Hammer's seventh and last film in their highly acclaimed Frankenstein series. While certainly not of a caliber as their earlier films, this movie is still quite enjoyable for a number of reasons, first and foremost being the return of Peter Cushing to the role after being replaced by the pallid and dull Ralph Bates for "Horror of Frankenstein". Cushing made this role his a long time ago, and he is always a joy to watch, glibly manipulating everyone around him, in this case the entire staff of an insane asylum, until everyone is working for him! Terence Fisher was back for one last go as director, and while this film falls a little short in some areas (notably the incredibly cheap-looking rubber suit of the neanderthal man-monster), Fisher's masterful handling of his actors never lets it get dull. It is a fitting conclusion to a wonderful series of films. One can only lament that Hammer's Dracula films never even approached this kind of continuity or satisfaction!
