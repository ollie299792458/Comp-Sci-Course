This is one of those romantic films that involves an ensemble of characters with different romantic issues in which most of the stories end up overlapping somehow at the end. This particular one happens to have a fairly long list of well-known actors, many of whom do a pretty decent part with their lines. It also has the broad range of situations a movie like this usually has from kids who have crushes to an older couple and everything in between. It's the kind of movie you feel like you've seen many times before. The setting of this one is valentine's day in Los Angeles. As is typical with a movie like this, there are so many characters and so many plot lines that it's difficult to flesh all of them out very well, so the quality of the movie depends on good writing and tight scripts that don't waste too many minutes on things that are peripheral to the stories. As it turns out, this particular one is fairly well-done. I'm sure most people will find the movie to be light-hearted and entertaining if not extremely memorable or unique.
