As unfortunate as it is that this movie was bad, it's not unlike the  current crop of fright flicks, quality wise.  Sporting a cast with  considerable potential, it did little to satiate the desire for horror any  common movie-viewer may have expected.  However well this film may have  fared as a book, the translation to film was undoubtebly of lesser quality.  The character diversity was present, with all its earmarked stereotypes,  the bed ridden quadrapalegic forensic genius(Denzel Washington), paternal  suicide trauma stricken attractive good-cop(Angelina Jolie), always  interfering doubt-stricken bad-cop(Michael Rooker), barely seen cop of few  words(Ed O`Neill), obnoxiously humble bedside nurse(Queen Latifah), and  finally Eddie, the crazy associate artifacts analyst with silly accent and  much-needed comic relief(Luis Guzman).  Philip Noyce(director) and Martin  Bergman(producer) may have had too much confidence in this film, as  evidenced in the included extra behind the scenes footage which did little  to convey any shadow of interest.  All it basically succeeded at doing,  being placed at the end of the movie, was giving insight to the forces of  madness which allowed this film to see the bigscreen.  After the beginning  portion of sub par scenery, the movie tailspinned into a predictable series  of semi-alarming shock shots.  Angelina Jolie and Denzel fans look  elsewhere, sadly the acting suffers a dissuading mediocrity, leaving much  to be desired.
