As someone who's watched the first movie repeatedly, I was extremely happy when the sequel was announced.  The first movie had a playful, whimsical aspect that made it endearing and fun to watch.  The pacing was excellent, and the characters were well developed.

Sadly, the sequel turned out to be very different.  The direction turned to "how many over-the-top effects and fight sequences can we pack into 2 hours."  The characters were lost in a morass of confused and often irrelevant action scenes.  About the best part of the whole film was [warning: spoiler] Barbossa's reappearance at the very end.

I like a well choreographed sword fight or SFX scene as well as the next bloke, but making a movie that is nothing more than a series of such scenes strung together with minimal plot is ridiculous.  This film could have been so much more than it is.  Instead, it's too long (I found myself checking my watch, which almost never happens) and badly plotted.

Given the reappearance of several minor characters (Pintel and Ragetti, who were apparently brought back as audience favourites despite the fact that they should have been in prison following the first movie) and the overall tone of the film, it appears Disney's producers saw fit to turn what was an excellent concept into little more than a marketing vehicle designed to appeal to kids.

I'll probably see the 3rd movie just to find out what happens, and to see if it improves somehow, but I'll never buy the 2nd movie's DVD.  It's just intolerable.
