My husband and I watched only the NC-17 rated director's edition. We always watch the director edition in order to get his/her sincere cinematic vision.  While the production quality, casting, acting, lighting and music were sublime, we had a problem with director Lee's stated mission: to teach modern Chinese generation of their historical past (as he outlined in the interview that accompanied the movie).

If this was his overall choice in literary material to convert to film format, why choose one with such a pornographically violent sexual heart? The only way to understand the story's literal/symbolic "raping of Communist China by the Japanese during WWII" (and their Chinese bullies represented by main character Yee) is by watching the unedited violent sexual tryst of collaborator Yee and resistance agent Mai Tai Tai. By submitting herself to a destructive relationship Mai wins Yee's trust, and at the same time is defeated since her good heart won't allow her to assassinate a lover.

Is this a celebration of Communist Chinese character? A denegration of collaborators and occupational forces? We don't see it as such. Is Lee saying that this the only way Chinese can fully understand the Sino occupation?  Perhaps director Lee makes a statement on the fact that in war no one wins.  At any rate, how is this a cultural lesson for today's Chinese generations?  How many Chinese families want their children or teens to see that?  We think it is more Ang Lee wandering into sexual cinema and taking historical costumes with him for validation.
