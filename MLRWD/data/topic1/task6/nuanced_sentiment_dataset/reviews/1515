This documentary wasn't one sided at all. It was very objective. Here is a link to a web site created by his patients [...]

After seeing the movie I asked my doctor here in Florida about Dr. Burzynski. He told me he referred a patient to Dr. Burzynski in Huston, TX for a grade 4 astryocytoma aggressive brain tumor for a 12 year old nephew of his friend who was told he only had 4 weeks to live and no reason to even try chemo or radiation. Long story short: That 12 year old kid is now 40 years old. Completely cured. This isn't a single case, many cases. His treatments are not a 100% cure, but far better than chemo or radiation. In some types only 25% success rates, but even in these cancers chemeo and radiation treatments only getting 1% cure rates. Also, no serious side effects. I know I would go to him if I got cancer. I went to the white house web site and signed the petetion that was started by his patients to put pressure on the Obama administration to help get his drugs available for patients with cancer to use if they wish.
