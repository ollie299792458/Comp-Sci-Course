Renny Harlin is a hack, OK? He's Jan De Bont, he's Stuart Baird, he's Roland Emmerich. But. irretrievably derivative as it is, "Deep Blue Sea" is the only one of the bank-breaking B movies he's made that verges on actually being  a right old hoot. And the only one that isn't even remotely dull. Never mind the claptrap about sharks taking smart drugs. And yes, the cribs are telling and obvious. Shameless even. A little "Abyss"here, a dash of John carpenter's "The Thing" there and magnificent dollops of "Jaws".( And if sequel rumors prove accurate, a large helping of "Hard Rain" , that ungodly B movie starring Morgan Freeman,  will be added to the stew ) But of course.  Still there's something Hawksian about it that makes my nose hairs do jigs. Most of the time against my better judgment. A group of people  sardined in a cramped space while evil lurks, or swims, in the storm-ravaged outside. You know the drill. But it's a terrific drill. Harlin is far (very far) from being a Hawks or a Carpenter or a Speilberg.But here, for once, he's stalwart , cunning and game where he used to be clueless,  vacuous and self-important.  Samuel Jackson and LL Cool J are, as per usual, fun. Thmoas Jane and Saffron Burrows are not.  But Harlin gives us  very little downtime between the set pieces to care. Besides, wooden actors are what makes B movies fun. And the sharks are the real MVPs of this  movie, just as the extras are the real reason to shell out the moolah for this DVD. Still. This timekilling mother has bluster and velocity to spare which, when you've got nothing better to do, is  an infintely sweeter deal than soiling yourself with such crap as "The Haunting" and "US Marshals".
