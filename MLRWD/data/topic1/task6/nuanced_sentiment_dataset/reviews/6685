well i just don't know how i feel about this film.  i went into this movie as a huge fan of gaiman, mckean, and jim henson presents; so i fully expected to adore this film with all my heart.  i'm not going to say i was dissappointed, i wasn't.  i just felt somewhat...unfulfilled by it.

the problem is i can't figure out exactly what my problem with it is.  it is visually stunning, thanks to dave mckean's amazing artwork and visual direction.  the acting is sometimes less than mind-blowing, but it isn't distracting.  the dialogue is neil gaiman excellent, everyone is consistently offering witty quips that don't seem forced or awkward.  plus, the "dark" queen and helena have spiffy full eye black contact lenses, which for some reason i've always loved.  who could ask for anything more?

i think the problem lies mainly in the editing, actually.  what should be a great movie is reduced to being only ok because of poor pacing and drawn out scenes with little to no purpose.  and so i suppose for this the blame must fall on my beloved dave mckean, an admission that hurts me more than him, surely.

but as i've already said, mirrormask is not all bad, in fact it's not bad at all.  it's just not great.  i would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of any of the parties involved, especially gaiman fans.  even with the distracting visuals, his writing is startlingly good as always.
