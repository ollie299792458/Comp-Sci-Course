Another in a string of movies and TV shows where the father figure is portrayed as incompetent when it comes to domestic duties.  The mother figure, by contrast, is in control and unflappable.
While the movie has some enjoyable bits you can't help but wonder why, when Kate (the mother) goes on a book tour, the teenage children don't do more to help out.  They're not even asked to do more.  Instead they get to whine about how much better life was back in their old town and to point out to dad what a lousy job he's doing.
What's meant to be an amusing descent into chaos (because dad can't cope with running the family while mom is away for two whole weeks!) just gets more grating, right up to the "crises" when the Woody Allen looking kid runs away.
At that point the family pulls together in a 'awww' moment and puts aside their differences for the higher good.  Talk about ham fisted audience manipulation.
By the end of the movie you just wish these brats would suck it up and pull their own weight.  But then we wouldn't have a movie.
