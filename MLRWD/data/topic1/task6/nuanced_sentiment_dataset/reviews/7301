I had high hopes for this based on the trailers. It was a worthwhile experience for the reminder that a movie can be so bad as to be physically painful to watch. I stayed through to the end, even though I knew after the first five minutes that there would be no ultimate redemption here. As a cosmic balance maneuver I guess we have to make up for all the good movies by occasionally watching one that makes you wonder what passes for quality control in Hollywood these days.
I think a little name naming is called for here since we would all like to avoid the truly bad in the future. Directed by Danny Leiner (Gilmore Girls, Felicity, the Tick). Stick to TV, Mr. Leiner. Please.
Written by Phillip Stark, a web search revealed no other writing credits. One hopes he doesn't hide his work under other names as well.
And now for the really embarrassing credits. The otherwise excellent Jennifer Garner (Alias), Marla Sokoloff (the Practice) and Brent Spiner (Star Trek Next Generation) prove that the transition to movies sometimes means taking whatever roles you can get. Maybe they took some tips from co-star Chris Elliot (Letterman).  
If you can't remember the people, remember the label: Fox Home Entertainment. I certainly will. Like anthrax.
