There's little I can add to the glowing reviews of this movie that have already been posted.  It really is a classic, hilarious in a very dark way, and eminently watchable 40 years after it was made.  Rating the movie, as a movie, I'd give it 5 stars without hesitation.

Unfortunately, the print they used to make the DVD - I have the Special Edition, not the 40th Anniversary set - is less than perfect. There are lots of little speckles and flecks that are clearly on the print and not the result of digitizing the images. You'd think they would have either found a better print or cleaned up the one they used; it's not hard to do cleanup on a black-and-white print.

That said, the photography is often great. The close-ups of Sterling Hayden are masterful, and the War Room appears totally real.  The only place where it's obvious that they're using composite shots is when you see the B-52 flying over the Arctic landscape.

So, while I love this movie, I have to dock it a point for the poor print. If I could give this DVD 4.5 stars I would, but there's no provision for that.
