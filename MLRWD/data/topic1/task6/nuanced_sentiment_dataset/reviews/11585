The mystery was the only good thing about the movie.  That was it.  My sister and I had to pull out the original to wash this movie out of our minds.

Scooby-Doo is supposed to be fun but this one isn't.  I endured "Zombie Island," "The Witch's Ghost," and "Alien Invaders" - but I don't watch them often because they don't feel like Scooby-Doo.  They're too dark, the villains are to threatening - and I'm not talking supernaturally.

I don't mind the supernatural in some of the Scooby movies.  A sense of wonder is as important as being skeptical.  Remarkably, Scooby-Doo has found a way to blend the two worlds into one.

Also, I can't buy anyone but Casey in the role of cartoon Shaggy.  Every time he spoke, I was pulled out of the cartoon, realizing the truth.

Daphne's regressed back into "Danger prone" Daphne instead of being the competent lady she is in the later movies and tv series.

But the constant agenda of pushing Fred and Daphne romantically kills me, making it less family friendly.  This movie, as well as "The Mystery Begins" is pushing my devotion to the limit. I watch the original to get in a Halloween mood and notice that Fred goes off more times with BOTH girls than he and Daphne do.  So, why isn't there a triangle?

Developing a romance between two of the main characters destroys the close friendship they all have.  Can you imagine what would happen should Fred and Daphne fight or break up?  Sides would be taken and it's good-bye Scooby Gang.

If they continue along this path, they will lose me.  Warner won't notice but it'll hurt me because I have loved Scooby-Doo since I was a child.
