My two stars are strictly for Streep's wonderful performance; the movie itself is a confused, annoying mishmash that sheds little actual light on Thatcher's long political career. Instead, we are treated to the "memories" of a pathetic old woman, with dementia, who once was a significant historical figure.
I will admit up front that I am a long tome admirer of Lady Thatcher; if that colors my review, so be it, but I am trying to be objective.
This awful travesty  of filmaking seems to revel in it's emphasis on Thatcher as she sadly is today, rather than exploring her difficult rise to the top of the Conservative Party , being not just a woman, but the daughter of a grocer! Quelle horreur! Her triumphs seem to be portrayed grudgingly, but her failures almost celebrated.
Obviously, Lady Thatcher was, and remains a divisive figure, both in the UK and elsewhere; most historic, transformative figures are as well. Yet this film fails to answer both the how, and the why of it's subject.
Thankfully, this was a Red Box rental, and not a purchase, so only $1.28 wasted ( plus tax).
