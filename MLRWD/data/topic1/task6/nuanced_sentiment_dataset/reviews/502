Oh my god, enough is enough, for pete's sake ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. They are going to ruin the series! I mean look at that stupid director Tim pope who directed "the crow 2: City of angels" and Bharat Nalluri who directed "the crow:Salvation".These two punk @$$ directors ruined the legend of the first film. Now this other scumbag named Lance Mungia has to ruin it again. why? why? WHY!, Omg and to think that edward furlong is going to be playing the main character. Its sad that edward furlong took the time to play in this junk. Instead of starring in Terminator 3: Rise of the machines. What an idiot! Just stop with the sequels i mean please just stop! I would have done something smart that these three idiots wouldnt have done MAKE A PREQUEL that is of coarse if brandon lee was still alive. The sequels will never be the same without brandon lee. Brandon owns! He will always sadly be remembered. R.I.P brandon. If only you could come back from the dead and kill these three stupid @$$ directors.
