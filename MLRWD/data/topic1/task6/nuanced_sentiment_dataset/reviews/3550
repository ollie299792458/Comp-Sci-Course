Don't get me wrong.  I enjoyed Hayden Christensen's performance in "Life as a House."  And I felt he gave a good, strong effort in Star Wars trilogy.  But I just feel he's not the appropriate actor for the lead role of David Rice, the jumper whom the movie revolves around.  The guy discovers his jumping ability as a teenager, and runs away from home, leading to an easy life of crime.  After setting up this background, the movie picks up on David eight years later.

If you pause and think about it, the character David Rice is an immature, small time crook who could basically go anywhere he wants to.  It's okay for him to steal to finance a lavish lifestyle, because he has that one-in-a-billion god-given talent to do it.  Life is easy for David Rice.  And I just think Christensen plays the David Rice role a bit too straight and narrow.  Rice is crafty, beguiling, the big easy, and Christensen does not role play Rice in that way.  Christensen has the good looks of a leading man for this film, but not the sly, charming, and shifty manner needed for this role.

Perhaps Leonardo DiCaprio can take over for a Jumper II film?
