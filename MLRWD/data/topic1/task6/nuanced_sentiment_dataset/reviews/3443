This movie is some very well shot and edited "Reality Horror". Here's the deal. Five nice looking regular acting high school age girls are in a van and they are chased by a crazy woman with a shotgun. That's the simple story. Easy to understand.

The girls SCREAM and cry through the entire movie but they have good reasons to do that. The movie stars six-females that all look like they jumped off the high dive into a pool of razor blades by the time the movie is done.

Unlike EVERY MOVIE EVER MADE these girls are in a regular, modern day van. Like a 2000 something model Dodge Caravan. Cars from the 50s are great for movie making because they are so big and wide inside. I can only imagine how hard it was to get great camera shots in the confines of this van.

You can tell that there was a ton of effort put into this low budget movie from the actors and whoever actually cut this movie up and put it together.

I think this is the first all female horror/terror movie I've ever seen.
