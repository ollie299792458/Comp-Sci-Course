Apart from 10 minutes in which the filmmakers and the film's protagonist make a lame attempt to explain WHY priests are likely to sexually offend, this movie is brilliant and should be viewed by parents, church leaders of any faith, politicians, psychologists and law enforcement officials. In other words, just about everyone. It is yet another tale of power and money corrupting (supposedly) good men. Father O'Grady is a sick puppy who of course should be behind one set of bars or another (either jail or a mental ward of some sort), but his superiors who allowed him to continue his ways will, I think, someday occupy a special place in hell. Using the church, the business of saving souls, to attain power, and allowing children and families to be torn apart in order to reach that power, is nothing short of evil.

Those of us who call ourselves Catholics should all demand that Rome admit its mistakes, apologize to all victims and set a strict standard of turning all criminals within the church over to law enforcement officials. Hiding behind the church to allow criminals to prey on children can not be accepted.
