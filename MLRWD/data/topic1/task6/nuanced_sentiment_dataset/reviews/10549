Everything about this movie really surprised me, because it was a totally different teen comedy experience in my opinion. The movie is filled with so much random comedy, but it does have purpose and that is what I love about it. I went to school throughout the 90's-early 2000's and I think teens can really relate to this movie because it deals with one of the most major impacts that is now a huge part of society, which is text messaging and facebook. Rumors are spread around the schools like wildfire faster than ever thanks to social networks and texting. Privacy is sacrificed more and more as each day passes and this film definitely gives a "it's none of business!" vibe to the main character and it is well deserved for her.

Whether you liked it or not, although I really do not see how anyone could not like this movie, it will become one of the best movies of this new decade. Films like "10 things I hate about you" and "She's All That" were great teen films but they were more fit for the 90's and I think films like this will be more like what we will be seeing in the near future.
