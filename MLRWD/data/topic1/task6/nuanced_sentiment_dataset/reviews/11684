Let me start by saying that the other leap frog videos are awesome! This one, however, is not.

I like the animation, but it isn't consistant with the rest of the videos and if youre child is used to the other ones they might not like the change.  My daughter seemed unphased.

In the first letter factory, you have Leap, Lily and Tad going from Oldest to Youngest, respectively.  That theme continues while Tad learns is alphabet, phonics, numbers, counting, etc with his older brother and sister helping him.  NOW Tad is  Lily's twin! What?  and he doesn't know anything?  Huh?  I would thing consistency helps in learning.

My 2year old loves this video.  It's entertaining and I do like the animation. BUT its not a typical leapfrog educational video that I'm used to. It's their earlier edition If you want more learning, I would go to the more specific videos like: Letter Factory, Math Circus, etc. Those videos stick more.  My daughter knew her letter phonics within 2 weeks of randomly watching Leapfrog's Letter Factory.

But this video has a little of everything and is entertaining.  I can see with repetitive viewing why this could be educational, but isn't worth as much as their other video series.  It's too much.  The alphabet is 26 letters and the pretty much whip through it.  The same goes with lots of other subjects and their songs.

AND I'm not a fan of the songs.  the calendar song reminds me of a song in Wicked, the musical, with the months as lyrics.  Its annoying- and I liked Wicked.

This is pretty much a cartoon.  Glad I didn't buy it.

PS. I do like Edison.
