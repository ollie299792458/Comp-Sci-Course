I'd been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. The concept of a group of senior citizens moving from the UK to live in a hotel in modern day India, appealed to me.

I'm a big fan of Judi Dench and I loved how her character changed from being sad (before she left the UK) then taking on new challenges, and how she fared. They all had different reasons for going to India.

At first the retirees found it difficult to adapt, and the hotel not quite as they expected, but most of them got into the swing of things. As one of them said you have to go with the flow.

I don't want to give any of the story away, but something sad happened on the 45th day of their stay, I was watching the movie to cheer me up! By the end of the movie I'd almost forgotten and I felt happier.

I'm glad I bought the movie. It was good to see Judi and the other actors British actors I hadn't seen for a long time. It was also nice to get a glimpse of what it's like there today.
