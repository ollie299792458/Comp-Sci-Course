This movie is a keen look into what happens when the earth becomes ridden with strange plagues and murderous thieves that for some reason love to sport chainmail.  The main plot is that some bionic cyborg chick has to get this cure to atlanta to save the world from the plague.  She about gets ruined by a chainmail sporting murderous thief named fender and his merry henchmen.  She only about gets ruined because Van Damme comes and saves her.  Van Damme in this movie wields a sword which is pretty cool considering it's the future and they should have phasers or spazers or lazers or something to the effect.  Old school just works best sometimes. So they get away and then van damn starts having all these punisher like(the comic not that god awful movie) flashbacks where a gang kills his family.  The gang just happens to be fender the chainmail sporting murderous thiefs gang which is also the gang that was curently pursueing them.  How ironic!  So later they meet up with this hot chick who you see naked when she gos to bath in the ocean.  Wowzers!!!!  Van Damme gets all close with her and stuff and then he gets crucified and finds his daughter is in fender the chainmail sporting murderous thiefs gang.  So Van Damme gets all determined and go's and gets all strong and go's to fight fender the chainmail sporting murderous thief.  What happens then?!?!? You'll have to watch to find out.  I am a cyborg so I really appriciate this flick.  It's a good view into the life of your everyday bionic cyborg.  Ah...how I miss the days when I was human.
