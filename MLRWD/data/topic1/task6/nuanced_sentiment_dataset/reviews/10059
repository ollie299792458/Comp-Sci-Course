The movie is for the most part, pretty good. I should know, I have been watching it quite frequently. There are some continuity problems since the Crowe-Ryan love scene was deleted from the film. Worse than that, IT IS NOT ON THE DVD. This is why DVDs have special features, for cut footage, unless of course, Meg Ryan objects. So, just act like there was a love scene right before you see Russell swimming in the pool and you'll be able to follow. 
This brings me to the film's other large problem, Meg Ryan. Could they have not gotten a better actress? Ryan spends most of the film with her mouth hanging open or trying to act like she is twenty. The latter which becomes painfully apparent for the viewer when she is running through a plaza. Watch, you'll know what I mean. Seriously, where were the good actresses when they started calling people about this part? What were they doing? Perhaps this inadequacy would not be so bad if the other actors were not so good, namely Mr. Crowe, who probably is just physically incapable of giving a bad performance and Mr. Caruso, who is great in the part of the gung ho hero. All in all, it would have been a great movie, if not for Meg Ryan.
