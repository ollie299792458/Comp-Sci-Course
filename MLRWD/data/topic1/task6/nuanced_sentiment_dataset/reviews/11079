When trailers for this movie were being shown in theaters, I groaned and felt that this would be a film riding on the success of the fantastic Happy Feet film.  I was sure that it wouldn't stand on it's own, that it had no soul to it, it was just going to be fluff.

And I was proven wrong, and I'm glad for that.  Surf's Up really makes itself stand on it's own, it truly is an individual in the penguin movie crowd.  It doesn't NEED to ride on Happy Feet's coattails, it creates its own beautiful world and really stays strong throughout the (sadly short) film.

I was struck with how beautiful the scenery was, and how alive every character was.  It's completely fantastic how real and believable everyone is, and that is thanks to the documentary style, without a doubt.  The documentary style is a true asset to this film's heart and soul.  You're not just watching events unfold, you feel like this actually happened, the filming, the location, the Pen Gu contest, that they're living and breathing.  It's really impressive.

I watched Surf's Up three times while it was in the theaters, and I can't wait to own the DVD.  Don't listen to yourself if you think it's just another penguin movie, it isn't.

Beautiful, beautiful movie, as Cody says "You'll wanna watch it over and over!"
