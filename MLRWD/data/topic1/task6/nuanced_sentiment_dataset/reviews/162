This slow moving BBC film by Robert Altman concentrated on Vincent's madness and the parasitic relationship he had with others, primarily his brother Theo. I am very sure that Vincent Van Gough was a difficult character, but his family was not any better. His own father described the artist as not special, but different. Theo did support Vincent financially and spiritually. But I don't think it was fair to portray vincent as a totally raving leech either. Paul Gauguin was given way too much credit for being a good friend, when in real life he was using Vincent for essentally pay. The ear incident was taken completely out of context as well. Having said that, the movie wasnt that bad. It was well acted and artfully photographed. I had high expectations and that may be why I was a little dissapointed in it. It was not a totally accurate depiction of the artist or his relationship with his brother, but it was a movie and not a documentary and as such was a good story and an evening well spent.
