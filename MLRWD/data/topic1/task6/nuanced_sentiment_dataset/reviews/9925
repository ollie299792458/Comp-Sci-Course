The movie MouseHunt starts with a visual tour of an old string factory. The set design is delightful. The camera work is perfect. The choreography of the workers and machines is a pleasure to watch. It bodes well, and similar scenes later in the film are also excellent, as the camera follows our hero mouse as he navigates rube-goldbergesque paths through the old house in which he lives.

Unfortunately, everything else about the film is much worse. The story involves two hapless brothers, reduced to penury and near-homelessness, who discover that a decrepit house willed to them by their father is fantastically valuable. All they need to do is to make one $1200 mortgage payment. They decide also to kill a mouse living in the house.

As a result, we get 90 minutes of humiliation and mayhem, as they are stripped naked, dropped in icy ponds, hit by busses, and totally destroy the house. I found myself wincing over and over again. The guys were simply not hateful enough to make their suffering amusing. I just wanted it to end.

In the end, thanks to a deus ex machina, things turn out a little better for them, but by then the damage has been done.

Much of the movie might be amusing to a ten- or twelve-year-old, who would take it as a live action cartoon. However, the opening scenes prominently feature corpse abuse, and later development include discussions of kinky sex, and other things you may not want to share with your pre-teen.

Two stars rather than one because many of the visuals were excellent.
