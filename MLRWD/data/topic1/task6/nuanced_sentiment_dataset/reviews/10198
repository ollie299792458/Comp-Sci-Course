As a Civil War buff, I anxiously awaited this movie.  I was surprised that it went in and out of the local theaters so fast, now I know why.  I fully expected that Robert Redford was going to use the trial of the Booth conspirators as an allegory tale to the current Guantanamo military tribunals and I signed up for that when I started watching.  What I did not expect was that Redford would succeed in making one of the most interesting events in American history boring.

Redford gets so caught up in preaching that he forgets story telling.  He even goes so far as to omit the actual historical incident that could have been the dramatic climax to his movie:  One of the conspirators Paine stated "Mrs. Surratt is innocent!  She doesn't deserve to die with the rest of us....."  Popular myth has him saying it on the gallows (he said it in his cell) and Redford could have used that myth to drive home his point in a dramatic climax, yet he left it out.  Why?  I suspect because for the entire film the other conspirators in the movie could have been represented by cardboard cutouts, serving only to be shown as being led in and out hooded and then sitting like mannequins.  By the end of the movie its too late to give them  dialogue, even if that dialogue was critical to the theme of the movie.

In fairness, I think the cast did the best they could, every once in a while you see glimpses of what this movie could have been. At times you can see the pain on their faces as they grope to find some life in this dry script.  However, at the end of the movie you just sit there and say "Is that all there is?"  Hard to believe but this movie is so poorly scripted and edited at the end you see several people hung and you struggle to care.  You feel that this film commits a second murder, draining the life out of what should be a pivotal story in American History.
