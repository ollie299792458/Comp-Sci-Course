I saw Sin City.  I loved it.  I saw 300.  I loved it.  Naturally when I saw another film from from the same minds coming out I thought, "How could this miss?"

Maybe it was high hopes.  Maybe I was expecting something that clearly this film was not.  I am willing to accept that, on some ground, the failure of this film was my fault.  However, this is a film struggling to find itself.  It shows us a gritty, Sin-City-esque exterior with all the flair of its predecessors, yet manages to go like a bat out of hell in the other direction.  It reminded me of a take on Evil Dead 2.  A movie with the heart of a horror, but was really intended to be a comedy.  It is the only excuse I can find for the inane babble that simply detracts from the overall story and ultimately loses you.  Yet it is the odd costumes and odder characters that makes someone look at the screen in stunned horror.  Clones with their names on their shirts?  Check.  Samuel L Jackson in a fur coat and a pimp hat smashing a toilet over our heros head?  Check.  A full zoot suit with Keds?  Check.

I realize in the end that movies are an art form and frankly, what appeals to one will not appeal to another.  However, that being said, this film fell flat in the first ten minutes and never really rose again.  In the end this film should be rented with caution.  It is either a film you will get or you won't.  And if you don't, no stylish camera work or art work will save it.
