The first season was a lot of fun.  Well, aside from the main character having one emotion and one expression 99% of the time, which continues throughout the series.  This season had the feel of Alias or another conspiracy spy show.  It fit more with season 2 in some respects, and stood apart from 1 and 3.  The series continues to require some serious suspension of disbelief, along the same lines as believing a prison would allow a death row inmate virtually unsupervised work duty.  Towards the end the conspiracy becomes murky and there seems to be action just for the sake of action, similiar to Alias.  Also they kill off/get rid of a lot of people... and while I appreciate that they don't make everyone bullet proof, sometimes it feels like they are just killing people for the sake of killing people.  Which is cemented by how the show ends.

I wasn't happy with the character development, especially regarding Sarah and Michael.  The first and beginning of the second season there was some chemistry, but the writers basically allowed that to be neglected, for one reason or another.  Apparently at some point they have sex, despite hardly ever touching, talking, or kissing on camera.  Since they run the plot around in circles for several episodes it feels akward that the writers didn't make room for a few minutes every couple of episodes for them being even slightly intimate beyond Michael looking really akward when making a joke.  Maybe the actors couldn't pull it off?  That alone knocked off one star for me, otherwise this would be solidly 4 stars.
