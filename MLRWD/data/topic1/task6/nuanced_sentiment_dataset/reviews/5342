Randolph Scott is acceptable as Hawkeye and the story line itself moves along about as well as you can expect, though it's all "Hollywood." You lose some of the emotional impact in 1936 compared to the remake in 1992, but it's not a bad little film. Not really. Although some of the costumes and dialogue are too cliche.

Some things grate, however. All the Native Americans are, of course, white actors. You have to expect that from the time period in question, but you can't help but wince about it today. However, I must say the actors who portrayed Chingachgook and Uncas did a particularly good job, imo, though Chingachgook should have looked much older. (And maybe they should have done a little more makeup preparation than putting a black wig on the guy.) However, the final battle between Chingachgook and Magua is pretty violent and brutal, even by 1936 standards, and Chingachgook's final speech is, as always, moving. The movie nails those points.

If you like this story, and want to see a fairly good representation of the novel, and if you can view it through the lens of post-code 1936 American racism, you could do a lot worse than this movie. Give it a peek.
