Agreeing with a previous review, I found this film to be extremely unrealistic in terms of what the experience of Alzheimer's is like (the character of Fiona had dependable and insightful short-term memory, for the most part, though she was confused randomly); and what long-term care facilities are like.  Maybe they are significantly different in Canada.  As a gerontologist, I kept wanting to point out numerous inaccuracies. Not allowed to visit one's relative for the 1st 30 days of a stay?  Big open spaces, with the long-term care facility staff having ample time to sit and chat with visitors?  I don't think so.  Then there is the issue of whose responsibility it is to help the residents keep fit.  Why didn't staff have Fiona talk to a psychologist or psychiatrist?  Many problems with this.  HOWEVER, Julie Christie and Olympia Dukakis are wonderful to see in action.  The husband was about as animated as the man Fiona befriends who cannot speak or do much of anything.  But the female actors (including the nurse) were great.
