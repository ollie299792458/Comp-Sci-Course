Okay, I am not a hardcore anime fan.  If you are, you may just want to skip the rest of this paragraph if you do not wish to be offended.  I've read a lot of hateful reviews that have slammed Disney because they did not create the movie exactly like the original Japanese version, they re-vamped the music score, yadda yadda.  Well, I don't care about any of that.  In fact, I can only stand to listen to the Japanese version for about 15 minutes.  I think the original has too many spots where there is no music for way too long.  I don't even like the Japanese voices.

But I LOVE this movie!  Miyazaki's work is beautiful, colorful, and lovingly alive in a way that American animated films for some reason cannot achieve. I think the English voice actors are very fitting and I think that all the extra added-in lines everyone is griping about make it much more entertaining and certainly funnier.  I laugh every time I watch it and I love watching it over and over and over.  No matter how many times I've watched it, I still feel the awe and presence of the world in which "Castle" is set; the rich simplicity of the Mining Town where Pazu lives, the silliness and oddity of the Tiger Moth, the wonder and mystery of Laputa, and the dread of Muska and his power-hungry ambitions (great bad guy, perfect voice-actor in Mark Hamilton).

The story simply flows.  Unlike a  lot of American films, "Castle" doesn't tell you everything by giving lengthly explanations about the how's and why's.  It lets you come to your own conclusions, make up your own assumptions.

I have only seen three of Miyazaki's films so far and love all of them.  This is my favorite, and probably always will be.  I can't wait to watch the rest of his films when they are released here in the states.

So my advice, if you're an average anime fan like me, is to ignore the flaming reviews and just sit back, relaxe, and enjoy this excellent movie.
