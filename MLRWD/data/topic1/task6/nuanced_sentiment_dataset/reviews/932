I am an avid fan of Thomas Jefferson, 3rd US President, inventor, author of the Declaration of Independence, and father of the US Patent Office (1790).  At a gathering of 49 Nobel Prize recipients at the White House on April 29, 1962, John F. Kennedy noted that never before had such talent been assembled in one room, except, perhaps, when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.

What I really hoped in buying this PBS DVD was to listen to a skilled actor voice over TJ's voice.  Would he have a British accent? Or a Virginia accent? or a mixture?  The result was mediocre.  The historians interviewed were quite lucid, but there were disappointing omissions.  Nothing much about his days at college (William and Mary), and almost nothing whatsoever about TJ's vast understanding of current science.  Jefferson, for example, knew that the Biblical notion of creation had to be wrote, because he was familiar with Linnaeus' taxonomy, and the fact of New World plants (Zea mays, pumpkins, squash) which did not jive with Biblical Creation.

The DVD way overemphasizes downsides and gossip about this great intellect:  his failure to renounce slavery, and his racist overtones in some of his writings.  This is like spending 20 minutes in an hour documentary on George Washington digging into the fact that he had false teeth made of wood.

I am hoping for a documentary with more depth, and new insight into this amazing man.
