Being "hooked" on British Detective/murder/mysteries and based on an Amazon recommendation, I decided to give the "George Gently" series a try.  Boy oh boy, I am glad that I did because it is a very splendidly written, directed and acted series that is set in 1960s long before "high tech" help was available.  The cases are horrendous and require loads of "nitty gritty" foot work crime solving police work that is done wonderfully.  .

With his very mellow and beautiful speaking voice Martin Shaw as George Gently is splendid as  the commander and chief detective solving some nasty murders and other crimes that occur North of London while directing the far from "politically correct" John Bacchus that is brilliantly acted by Lee Ingleby--although he is, among other negative things, extremely homophobic, I adore him; he and George really make a good team at solving the crimes that are on this three (3) disc set running over an hour and a half per disc.

I really enjoyed Season One of "George Gently" and intend on purchasing the subsequent seasons of this series
