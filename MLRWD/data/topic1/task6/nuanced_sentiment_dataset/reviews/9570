I have loved Castle since season one and have followed it faithfully since the very first episode. However, season four was a complete let down. The show didn't seem to be about solving crime with some added humor as it was in the first few seasons; now the show only seemed to revolve around Castle and Beckets unspoken attraction for one another. Don't get me wrong I like romance as much as the next girl but this was much too serious and dragged out for what is supposed to be a lighthearted mystery show! The only mystery the team even attempts to solve throughout this season is somehow always connected to Kate's mother's murder. (No offence now, but they either need to put her mother's murder on the back burner for a while or just solve it and move on!) The jokes that usually fill a Castle episode and make my Monday nights something I actually look forward too, were far and few between, and the warm humor usually brought from Castle's mother and daughter were also replaced by more drama! I'm hoping the next season will be better and return to what the show is really about and get rid of the unwanted drama. With the exception on one MAYBE two episodes, this season was a complete dud.
