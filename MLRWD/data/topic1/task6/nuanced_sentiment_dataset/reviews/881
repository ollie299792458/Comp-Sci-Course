This movie is a departure from the gross-out humor of the Farrelly Brothers.  Instead, it is a geniunely touching, heartwarming story of how family can drive you crazy, but ultimately is better to have then not.  The first half of the movie, in which we get to know Bob and Walt, provides adequate, if thin, history and character development, mostly illustrated by the twins' sports accomplishments.  Two scenes are right on target in their show of teamwork between the twins.  The first is the burger flipping scene in Bob's restaurant, when they put together a meal of 16 burgers in less than three minutes.  The other is the fight scene in a Hollywood bar, in which the twins demonstrate "twin-tae-kwon-do" moves and whoop some serious behind.
The second half becomes less funny, and more touching.  The scene in which the twins are surgically separated made me misty-eyed, and the montage of scenes that follows, during which Bob moves back to Martha's Vineyard and the twins must adjust to life as single people, had me reaching for the tissues.  One particular scene really wrenched my heart:  Walt is sitting on a park bench next to a sculpture of a man reading a book.  Walt then slides up next to the statue and puts his head on the statue's shoulder;  Waterworks on!
"Stuck on You" runs the gamut of emotions, so if you are an overly emotional person, be prepared.  It is funny, but also makes you feel good inside, and while it is certainly not the Farrelly's best work (on the level of "Mary" or "Kingpin"), it is definitely a worthy rental, and possibly even a nice one to add to your collection.
