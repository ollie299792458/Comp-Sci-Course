This is one of the more dissapointing blu-ray releases I've seen so far,dont get me wrong I really enjoyed the movie and the DTS audio is well balanced between the dialogue,expolsions and surround sound.The picture on the other hand is average at best,its grainy especially in dark scenes and throughout,there is really no colors that pop out and kinda muddy looking it really needed to be alot sharper.There are some pretty good scenes during the day time though but not enough to make up for the rest.I have to give Fox credit though were credit is dew,they included a second disc that can be downloaded to your computer and then your able to transfer it to what ever portable device you choose.This is really cool and is what I hope Fox and other studios will continue to do.I would have given this 3 stars but it is a product review so I have to consider the extra disc they included so I'll say 4 stars.Lets hope they give AVP-Requiem a better picture(which looks like they will from the HD trailer at the front of this disc)and include another downloadable disc.
