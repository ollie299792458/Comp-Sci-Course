Flawless, is a diamond-heist thriller set in 1960s London. The background, set and clothing was perfect for the time period.

Demi Moore plays Laura, a bright, driven executive at the London Diamond Corporation who finds herself frustrated by a glass ceiling after years of faithful employment, as man after man is promoted ahead of her despite her greater experience. Michael Caine is Hobbs, the nighttime janitor there who is virtually invisible to the executives that work there, but over the years has amassed a startling amount of knowledge about how the company runs. Hobbs has his own bone to pick with London Diamond.

The premise was a good one, but the film really was just so so. Some of it just seemed so far-fetched:

SPOILER ALERT

They obviously were suspicious of Laura/Demi Moore, yet she climbs into the sewer with her business suit and high heels UNSEEN???? And, Hobbs had all that extra time to get rid of all those diamonds? I know it's only a movie, but some things were just a bit over the top in my opinion.
