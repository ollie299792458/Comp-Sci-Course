I picked this flick up while wondering through a department store not long ago. I remember watching it when I was a kid and being wowed by the ultraviolence (now, seemingly timid compared to modern film standards). This is a lost classic folks, one which deserves to be seen again (and probably again). The DVD package has a nice presentation. Rollerball, as mentioned in other reviews here, has that timeless element that has staying power but is only slightly dated by the mid-70s texture and feel of many surealistic films being made at the time. While not quite the complete package as a whole, Rollerball stands along side Soylent Green in its visual texture and ominous warnings of corrupt corporatists. I also viewed the film as more of a socio-political statement more than ever beofore. It turns out to be somewhat of a paradox where corporate capitalism ultimately results in a communist framework where the individual is devalued (another reviewer described it as gentile fascism, which I think IS communism). The point is, this lost world where Rollerball is the only emotional outlet in a world with no books is all too prophetic when looking at some of the massive corporate consumption going on these days (i.e. media conglomerates and oil company pacts). The film is slow in some places though.
