What are the most common fears and frustrations of today's city dwellers? 
Your money can be taken from you. A spouse can betray you. The significant other can become addicted to drugs. Someone powerful can insult  you and you'll just swallow - or be squashed like a bug. Alien-looking  people can attack you on a street. A bartender will decide there is no need  to be polite with you. There are some exclusive places you are not allowed  to enter. The police is supposed to protect you but there are renegades in  their ranks that can abuse and blackmail you.  We are all afraid of torture  and death.
Payback is a kind of encyclopedia - the film addresses a wide  range of urban fears.
And you are invited to stand in the shoes of  someone whom you always wanted to be - the fearless adventurer, expert  fistfighter and sharpshooter, a man who can start a 10-minutes walk in a  street as a shabby pauper and finish it smartly dressed, with a new credit  card and a pack of banknotes. He is irresistible to women and deadly to  men. He is not afraid to die - an almost unique quality inherited from  Gibson's Lethal Weapon character.
So he beats everyone (women and  bartenders included), kills quite a few - he is getting even, he pays back,  he is fullfilling your dreams, attending to your fears. Nothing can stop  him.
The film wants to look visually inventive, contemporary.  Mostly it  comes to the blue filter being kept over the camera lenses. Or were the  freshly shot rolls of film soaked in a can of blue ink? Gibson narrates the  story in a way that makes him look like Chandler's Marlowe. And the final  song sends us back to the the films noir tradition.
But all these tricks  fail to amount to anything significant. The violence is excessive, Porter's  stubbornness ( -"$70 000, not $130 000!") begins to annoy very  quikly and the director's invitation to participate in that feat of  gratification is too obvious.
