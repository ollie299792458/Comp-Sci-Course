After seeing mixed reviews on Rotten Tomates my expectations for this movie were low. However, by the end of the movie my opinion was pretty high. I give it only 4 stars because I thought it dragged in spots in the first half.

There is extra material added to the book, which is more or less necessary to make this into a full-length movie. I thought the added content kept the spirit of the book and made for a more interesting movie.

Where this movie shines is in conveying the messages of the book. Dr. Seuss's book is not subtle. This movie is not subtle either. I was a little shocked at how heavy-handed it was, particularly in the song "How Bad Could it Be." I'm sure it will offend people. But by being in your face, this movie is keeping the spirit of the book.

I'm glad for this movie. It does gets the message out even more effectively to kids than the book, in my opinion.

Are all corporations evil and greedy? Of course not. But whether they are conscious of it or not, their actions often have very adverse effects. People like to ignore this and tell themselves it's not that bad. How bad could it be?

One of the easiest ways to make a lot of money is to convert life and health into money. Think about it. Have you ever heard of any companies selling products that were harmful or unhealthy? How about dumping toxic manufacturing byproducts into the land, water and air that we all depend on? How about mistreating employees or demanding too much "life" from them? If you have worked very long in corporate America some of these things will likely ring a bell.

The answer to the movie's song "How Bad Could it Be" is that it could be very bad. We really are making our planet uninhabitable in the long run. We have to change how we do things.

I enjoyed the hopeful, upbeat ending to this movie. I hope the reality of our future is as upbeat. Trends are not promising, I'm sorry to say.
