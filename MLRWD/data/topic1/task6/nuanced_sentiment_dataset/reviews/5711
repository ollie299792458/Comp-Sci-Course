This movie represents everything that is wrong with Hollywood.  One character was more pathetic than the next. Zach Braff's character cheats on his "perfect" pregnant girlfriend and then acts like it's somehow her fault that he did it. I was begging, pleading with her toward the end not to take him back, but he slept on the porch for a few days (even when it rained!), so I guess he should be forgiven. Casey Affleck self-righteously dumps his wife/mother of his child because she is frustrated with him for being a terrible father. He "takes the high road" by leaving her - she's such a drain with that crying baby. Give me a break.  The saddest part was the normally respectable Blthye Danner and Tom Wilkinson as the parents who also cheat on each other because hey, 30 years of marriage is a long time.  Then they welcome Zach Braff back into the house after he cheats on their pregnant daughter!  I feel bad for the poor loser who wrote this script - its transparency was nauseating. I also pity anyone who actually paid to see this "Gen-X" garbage. I am part of Gen-X and it made me sick.
