Thornton has created an American classic that can send viewers in many different directions.  After my 20th or so time enjoying Sling Blade, I became not so sure Karl is slow after all.  He watches a dad brag about his son's football skills, so then goes out of his way to make Frank a star when they play sandlot.  He fixes like an expert lawnmowers and other things with small engines.  He understands and appreciates kindness given to him ("that boy has a big heart and lives inside it").  Then he seems to realize that killing again is a solution to not only Frank's troubles but it will return Karl to a world in which he is a little more comfortable.  He seems to understand that he risks very little in doing so because he will be seen as crazy and not a murderer. 
It is also ironic that every character in the movie talks of killing someone as a solution to a problem.  Is that another lesson Karl learns about the outside world? 
Any slowness in Karl arguably stems from his treatment by his father, who raised him in a shed in the family back yard (where he learned to fix small engines), the effects of seeing his mother and a friend having sex, and his experiences in a mental hospital.  This is a man who picks things us quickly when given a chance.
I think the test of a great movie is that it gets better each time you watch it and that you learn different things each time you watch it.  I'm sure others will disagree with my take because I myself have just come around to feeling that way about it.  I'm sure Karl would be able to figure it out.
