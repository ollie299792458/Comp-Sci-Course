this movie was quite an experience to view. it challenges you not to feel some emotion. i think that vincent gallo really portrays true sadness in this film. i really felt his lonliness and depression, and saw much of myself and my adolescence in him.
some may say that christina ricci's character is too submissive.  i would have to disagree.  i felt that she was the only person in billy's life that could see the good in him behind his bad attitude.  gallo turns out to be a really good guy, and christina ricci's character was right all the long.  billy brown has lead a depressing life.  his parents are horrible, and we (or just i) feel so sorry for him.  we feel many different things about billy brown throughout the film.  we hate him for being so rude, 'kidnapping' a girl, etc. but we sympathize with him after seeing what a horrible hand he was dealt in life.  this is a very unconventional movie in general.  the shot selection and cinematography are very original and very good in my opinion.  
i think that much of the things in the story may be taken from vincent gallo's real life, that's how real and vivid they seem to be portrayed.  i also recommend the soundtrack with a great score from gallo himself.
