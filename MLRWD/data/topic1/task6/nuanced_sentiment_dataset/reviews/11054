This movie is, by no means, among Adam Sandler's best work.  The lack of chemistry between him and Winonna Ryder really showed, and I think it affected the plot in such a negative way, that most people would jump to the conclusion that it just wasn't a good movie.  I believe that if almost any other actress would have played the "love interest" in this movie, it would have done a lot better.  I can never really tell if she acts bad on purpose because she's supposed to be 'acting' within the movie, but for whatever reason, it really made her look bad.  An actor (Sandler) can only be as good as his co-star, as far as the chemistry part goes.  She took the 'acting on top of acting' thing way too far- she's already way under the bar as far as Sandler goes, so put those two together, and you've got a movie that doesn't live up to it's potential.  As far as my taste goes, it is worth seeing; I own it, and I watch it here and there.  To be honest, though, I own about every movie Sandler has out there- because I like him as an actor.  However, If you're not a Sandler fan, then honestly, it probably isn't worth seeing.
