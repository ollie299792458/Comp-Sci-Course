I had purchased this review after hearing a Relevant magazine podcast where the magazine editor had traveled to Rwanda.  In the interview the editor, Cameron Strang had commented on how the local people in Rwanda had said that if they had to pick a movie that told their story, they would choose 'Sometimes in April'.  Hotel Rwanda was good, but it did not accurately capture the character that Don Cheadle played.  The main factor missing, which Hollywood inserted, was genuine compassion for the people that he was saving.

This was truly an excellent movie produced by HBO films and Raoul Peck.  Movies like these need to be made to give voice to the voiceless who are victimized and so that we here in the West, can learn from the mistakes made in the past, so that future generations will never ever let something like what happened in Rwanda occur again.

The genocide occurring in Darfur has such chilling parallels, but at least the people there don't have to shame the rest of the world into action to provide help.  There we have a chance to stop genocide as it is actually occurring.

I would totally recommend this film, for those that want to see a movie that will challenge them, and leave an imprint on them to become advocates for the voiceless.
