Keeping it simple -> don't waste your money on a dvd disc. Get it for free on cable.  Reverberated film idea (nothing new). A cast / and most important the editing/direction/scriptwriting that makes the mistake, an ASSUMTION people will buy anthing as long as it has the 'Brand Name' actors for the draw.

Watching Oceans 12 - you get the feeling the actors are holding a mirror arm length to see themself in view instead of any unfolding of a meaningful character attachment. (Actors with a brain and not for the $paycheck should have stayed far away from this project)

Is this the producers idea? Lets make sequals that are fast on production, get the swelled ego gang together (the public will buy it, they buy anything) and lets spend that time showing to the celebrity junkies our crew - so wonderful to look at any real story line will go without notice (give me a break - not interesting)... And of course the Math -> Ocean's 12 - will make money with high expense - 'as long as it makes money'.

The public will only buy into these charades so many times.  In this case a re-manufactured presentation to put a film out - without regard to quality. Hopefully the 'public' will steer clear of actually paying even 1 Cent for this garbage - knowing the intentions are about the boxoffice $$$ and not about any new storyline appeal.
