Listen. Stop right now and definitely don't even think about buying this if cheesy acting, even cheesier visual effects and music as well as gaping plot holes greatly affect your movie-viewing experience.
Kurt Russell,  with his loud mouth antics and John Wayne swagger plays Jack Burton, a  California truck driver who, as it turns out, really doesn't know when to  keep his mouth shut. It gets him into a whole mess of trouble (hence the  title) in San Francisco when his little Chinese buddy Wang loses his girl  to a bunch of thugs.
Wouldn't you know these thugs happen to be the  minions of an ancient evil spirit, and when Wang and Jack, with a little  help from some friends, try to take down this evil sorcerer with a little  magic of their own, all hell breaks loose and the results are electrifying  and hilarious.
Definitely for fans of the Troma genre, Big Trouble in  Little China demonstrates that all you need is some kick-ass fight scenes,  Kurt Russell with a knife, and Kim Cattrall in a wet shirt and you have  what I am proud to say is my favorite movie to watch on "a dark and  stormy night."
