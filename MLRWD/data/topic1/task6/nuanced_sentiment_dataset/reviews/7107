Of course the Criterion Collection has wonderful extras and a great transfer. The problem is the film itself.

Preston Sturges made some genuinely profound films such as The Lady Eve, Unfaithfully Yours, and Hail the Conquering Hero that are rich and complex experiences. But Sullivan's Travels is  simplistic, pretentious, and false.

As the film's characters themselves point out, poverty is only intersting to the rich, whose view of it is distorted. As seen in Sullivan's Travels, odd-faced character actors in dingy sets present a rich man's view of poverty and are not at all related to the real thing. Sturges was one of the most highly-paid men in America, so his view of the subject matter is (like characters say in the film) based on cliche.

The climax with its chain-gang laughing at a cartoon, is pretty dopey and a fairly unconvincing argument for comedy. Sturges would do better to point to how comedy in his best films allows him to examine self-deception, angry love, role playing and a host of other themes--in other words how humor gets into the darkest and most ambiguous areas of human life that "serious" drama cannot so easily reach.

This film is exactly the kind of film that Sullivan wants to make--which is why it is so over-earnest and uninteresting.

If you want to see the genius of Preston Sturges, watch any of his other films (even Harold Diddlebock) in their entirety. After the first 10 minutes a simplemindedness takes over Sullivan's Travels that make makes it a dispiriting film.
