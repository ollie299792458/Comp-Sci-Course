Madagascar is the story of 4 zoo animals in Central Park (a lion, a giraffe, a hippo, and a zebra) that find themselves, through various twists of fate, on an island in the middle of the ocean. No more cages, no more zoo. But also no more free food or people to take care of them. (Neither of those ideas is really examined all that much in the film, just briefly mentioned).

The animation is a bit blocky and the plot is a bit thin, but I'm sure it will entertain kids. The problem is that in this day and age we expect our animated films to do more than mindlessly entertain our children, we expect to be entertained as well. Unfortunately, Madagascar does not meet those expectations.

Despite the big names this animated film boasts (Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, Jada Pinkett Smith, David Schwimmer, Cedric the Entertainer, Sacha Baron Cohen) the film feels a bit lackluster. That's partly due to the fact that none of these actors (Baron Cohen aside) know how to create a feasible character voice. These are name actors paid to sound like themselves. But a zebra with Chris Rock's voice is not entertaining, it's actually kind of annoying. The same goes for a giraffe with David Schwimmer's voice and a hippo with Smith's voice. Ben Stiller doesn't put forth much effort, but his lion, Alex, at least has a bit of character mixed in there. Sacha Baron Cohen definitely steals the film with his lemur-king Julien, but unfortunately he doesn't show up until halfway through the film.

The roll of the credits featuring Baron Cohen's Julien chanting "I like to move it move it!" is probably the most exciting and inspired part of the entire film. Although it's not a bad film, with all the other animation being made today, it's not particularly special.
