I am writing specifically about the DVD edition of Plan 9 that features original poster artwork on the sleeve and says "Bonus Show! The Ed Wood Story!" with a photo of Wood.

This edition has several new interviews with cast members (as well as Johny Depp commenting on his work for the film "Ed Wood") and a selection of trailers, BUT ALL SEGMENTS OF THIS DVD ARE WATERMARKED!

That means you will see the production companies initials in the lower right of the screen throughout all trailers and the entire length of the film. I don't mind these when I'm watching something for free on television, but when I've paid money to own it, I find it very annoying. If this doesn't bother you, then by all means go for this edition.

**** UPDATE ****
At the suggestion of RumPunch789, I ordered the "In Color" Legend Films edition. While the main selling point of that DVD is the colorized version of the film, the restored B&W is also included, and I have to say it is the sharpest I've seen! And while I generally have no interest in colorized films, the colorized version is actually done very well and is nice to have as a novelty, even though I'll probably never watch it all the way through.  Go for the "In Color" / Legend Films edition for the beautifully restored B&W print!
