Here we have the mysterious hero. We know little for certain of his past, aside from the observations of his enemies. We don't even know his real name, like the characters in the spaghetti westerns that starred Clint Eastwood. He is a super-killer who no one appears to be able to stop. I will grant that most of the action scenes are so farfetched that there would be no way they could happen in Real Life. But, this isn't real, it's only a movie and it's a pretty exciting film from start to finish.

Without giving too much away, this film has a continueing fetish with carrots. Not often does a vegetable have such a prominent role in a movie.

The choice of villain, played by Paul Giamatti, was excellent. Here we have the perfect adversary for the apparently unstoppable hero. He is so intelligent and so vicious, that there is every possibility that he could defeat our hero simply by guessing his next move, which he does on several occasions.

The female lead, played by Donna Quintano, is a very shallow character and little is done to flesh-out (so to speak) her character. The one and only sex scene in the film is completely ridiculous, which goes right along with the action scenes anyway. Quintano's portrayal of lactating escort Monica Bellucci is wooden, at times.

For an action-packed film, this is a good choice. If you want character development, pick something else. Personally, I had a lot of fun watching it.
