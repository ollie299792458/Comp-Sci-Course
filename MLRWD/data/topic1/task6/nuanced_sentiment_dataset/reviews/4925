Blue Lagoon was a commercial success but due to the terrible acting and the cheesy storyline, the movie did very bad with the critics.

I personally loved the beautiful scenery - the ocean and the islands - it really does make the movie worth seeing.  And Brooke Shields was just about the most gorgeous girl to look at when she made this movie - this is why the movie was a commercial success.  Though Brooke's acting was just terrible, she was so beautiful to look at that no one cared.  Now Brooke is trying so hard to become a serious actress.  She tries and tries and tries... however though she has improved somewhat, she just is not a good actress.  I just watched Bob the Butler and throughout the movie her efforts to try so hard to act well made it that I just couldn't see her character.  Brooke Shields trying so hard to act was all that anyone could see.  However this doesn't for a second take away from her great beauty and sweet nature.  She is a very nice person and a very lovely woman.

So if you haven't seen Blue Lagoon, see it if you just want to get lost in the beauty of nature and Brooke Shields.  Otherwise you'll just laugh at this movie.
