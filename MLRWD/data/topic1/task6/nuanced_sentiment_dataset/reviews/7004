First I'll promise you that there will be no spoilers and that this will be a very general review.

The Story: It's a story about redemption. The story takes place in Afghanistan and it does an excellent job of making you feel like you are really viewing a foreign country. I don't know how historically accurate it all may be, but it fooled me and that's good enough for me. There really aren't any "action" scenes. This movie is all about characters and story.

As I said in the title, I'm viewing this movie having read the book a month or two ago. Overall, I think they did a good job of capturing all of the major plots from the book but there was quite a bit of material missing that helped you connect with each character. I watched the film with my girlfriend and at certain points I wondered if she really understood what the characters were feeling and I paused the movie to tell her about certain points that were made in the book to help her appreciate more what each character was thinking.

Personally, I feel its unfair to compare a movie based on a book to the actual book because the book is almost guaranteed to be better and I don't believe that a story that works as a book will necessarily work as a movie. A movie also has to condense a lot of story into a very short time span that can be seen in one sitting, so thats a big disadvantage.

Having said all of that, my girlfriend cried so the movie did touch her. It's difficult to assess how good the movie stands on its own because I knew the characters so well having read the book, so if you've read the book and want to re-live this story in a much shorter span than it would take to read the book over, then I think you'll love it.

I'm giving it five stars, but I'm not looking at it as a stand-alone story or as an alternative to the book, but more as a partner to the book.
