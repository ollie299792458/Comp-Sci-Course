In 1939, director Lewis Milestone wanted to make John Steinbeck's classic tale of friendship and depression. Burgess Meredith (best known as The Penguin in the 1960s BATMAN and Mickey from the ROCKY franchise) and Lon Chaney Jr. (the son of silent film super star Lon Chaney and is best known as Larry Talbot in the classic film, THE WOLFMAN) star as George and Lennie. Burgess Meredith was the best actor as George, he was happy at the right time in the film and he was angry at the right time on film. Robert Blake was too kind as George in the 1981 remake and Gary Sinise was to much of an [...] as George in the 1992 remake. Lon Chaney Jr. was a great Lennie because he didn't overact playing a retard and became upset at the right time and place. Randy Quaid didn't seem to really put himself into the part of Lennie and John Malkovich was good but overacted playing a retard with that babyish voice. Also stars ROCKFORD FILES's Noah Beery Jr., Charles Bickford, Roman Bohnen, Leigh Whipper, Betty Field and cowboy actor Bob Steele. 5 out of 5 stars.
