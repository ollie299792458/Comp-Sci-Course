I'm sorry, but I grew up with the Alien series from the time I was little.  When I was 8, a friend brought over "Aliens" and we watched it with a large group of friends.  I was hooked from then on, and have always held an affinity for the series.  "Alien", "Aliens", and "Alien 3" were all superb instances of sci-fi horror, made even better if one has read the comic series produced by Dark Horse (which I have).  "Alien Resurrection", however, takes all that made this series good and throws it away.  
"Alien Resurrection" is quite possibly the poorest movie I have seen, a fact that is made worse by the superb quality of the previous three (though some may disagree on the quality of "Alien 3").  The characters aren't interesting, the Aliens aren't really all that creepy, and the "new" Ripley is just dumb. My biggest complaint of all, and many purists would agree, is that they constantly show the Aliens moving around the ship.  What made the first three films great is the fact that you really didn't know where the Aliens were until the big climax at the end.  This film traipses the Aliens across the screen for what seems like forever, ruining the suspense of the unknown.  How can something surprise you if you know where it is? 
I won't say this film doesn't have its good moments; the scene as the soldiers attempt to evacuate their doomed ship is particularly well-done.  The evil scientist's fate in the hive is particularly nice too, despite the idiocy of the altered hive-queen that follows.  
I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who loved the first films.  Instead I would say to read the excellent comic series and buy the first films.  "Alien Resurrection" is a waste.
