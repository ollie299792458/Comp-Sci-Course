Count me among the disappointed who watched this film.

I was really looking forward to it, being a longtime fan of the Amazing Kreskin's in particular and in stage magic and mentalism in general.

Unfortunately, there's not much here we haven't seen before.  Once again we have a wide-eyed innocent serving as an assistant to a demanding celebrity. I was told the writer/director really did work as an assistant for Kreskin, and presumably some of the quirks attributed to Buck Howard (not much of a stage name, by the way)came from Kreskin. But aside from that, there's nothing particularly revelatory that someone with a casual knowledge of Kreskin--or stage magicians in general--wouldn't have come up with.

It probably doesn't help that Colin Hanks gives a somnambulant performance. Malkovich tries hard in the role of the title character, but Hanks often seems so lost, it's hard to care much about what happens. Too bad the success of the film rests on his shoulders.

The movie's fairly manipulative--witness the over-oppressive soundtrack--and for me it just didn't work.  **SPOILER ALERT** I found it impossible to accept that Buck Howard would do everything he could to get back on top, then change his mind after a SINGLE PERFORMANCE headlining in Vegas. Couldn't he at least have worked a week before throwing in the towel?
