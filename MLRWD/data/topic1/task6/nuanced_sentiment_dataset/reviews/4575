Well howdy Pardner. I'm sweet super juicy hot gorgeous Jessical Biel and I do declare I will not get my pretty little sweet self nude in this horror classic remake.

That's right jackoes Jessica keeps it on NO NUDITY here.

But on the flip side this is a decent little horror film. The death toll is high the gore ample well reminds me what a fricked up world we live in that needs a giant enema.

We get brutal suicide and messy after shock. Chopped off legs, slashens, and lots a tension. Though I wish there had been more leather face. It could have been called attack of the sadistic crazy redneck cop.

Jessical Beil owns this movie. My beady little eyes were stuck to her like gum under a table. I couldn't get enough of her incredible asssssets in tights jeans and jiggley melons in a tight wife beater. I even dug the goofy flucken cowboy hat she was sporten. A must see for Jessica Biel Fans. As for the rest of the cast... sing it with me `Who are they who-who, who-who, I really want to know.'

TCM should satisfy any horror fan. You won't flip out in shock cause it's the best movie you ever saw though.
