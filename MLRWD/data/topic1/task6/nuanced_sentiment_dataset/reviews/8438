I know I'm swimming against the tide here given the other reviews, but I was really disappointed in this season. House's personality has always stretched believability, because no hospital could have a doctor like that on the staff, but it's a show, so we accepted it, telling ourselves that he's just blunt and doesn't suffer fools gladly. Apparently the writers decided that if we could accept that we were game to accept a good deal worse from not only House, but from his team as well, and the whole thing just seemed to devolve deep into soap opera land in the second season.

*** SPOILERS ***

- Not only is House his usual angry, rude, arrogant, mean self, but this season he throws himself at his old girlfriend (who is married) until she sleeps with him, and just as she's about to leave her husband House tells her to go back to him. As part of his attack plan House breaks into her therapist's office and reads her file so he'll know the weak points in her marriage. Gee, how much lower can you stoop?

- In one episode House appears to decide that he needs the distraction offered by a prostitute.

- When Dr. Wilson leaves his wife, he moves in with House, who is a total jerk to his only friend. He uses him, lies to him, sabotages his attempts to get an apartment, embarrasses him in front of others, and generally thinks its great fun to be cruel to someone who just found out his wife is having an affair.

- Cameron is apparently intrigued by a gay recreational drug user who claims that drugs and having AIDS has somehow made him really happy, so she tries some of his drugs she finds in his backback. Cameron, all whacked out on drugs invites Chase over and seduces him. The next day she's clearly still under the influence of whatever she took and it hardly generates a shrug from House or anyone else. But then, why would anyone care if a doctor is hyped up on recreational drugs?

- Cameron and Foreman bicker over some article he submitted and had published based on Cameron's writeup of a case. This goes on for several shows, both during consultations with House and in front of patients. Foreman was a jerk and Cameron handled it like a child. Grow up, people.

- Cutty apparently decides she wants to have a baby. It's like they imported writers from General Hospital for this season.

- Chase fails to properly diagnose a patient because he'd just found out his dad died, but for some incomprehensible reason decides to apologize to the patient's husband for being too hung over to treat her properly. Apparently he really wanted to get himself and the hospital sued (and it worked).

- House shoots a corpse in the morgue to see if the MRI machine will pull bullet fragments out of a person. Apparently it will (at least in this fantasy show), but it puts the MRI machine out of commission for two weeks while it gets fixed. "My bad," says House. Indeed.

- The final episode is a cliffhanger, and it turns out that almost the entire show is just House having an hallucination/dream. There is little I find less interesting than a story that isn't even real to a ficticious character.

All of this, combined with a few other issues convinced me that they just didn't have good writers this season. The show has a great premise and an excellent cast, but the writing was weak this season in my opinion, because instead of writing solid, interesting stories, they resorted to cheap soap opera plot devices. Character development is good, but the cases need to be interesting as well, and character destruction is not the same as character development.

As for the cases, well, you'd think lumbar punctures, MRIs, and biopsies are the only diagnostic tools they have, and virtually any combination of symptoms can be explained by one of about a half-dozen conditions that get mentioned in almost every show (and never turn out to be the problem). In general there's less focus on cases and more on the interpersonal turmoil than there was in season one, and I thought thought the show suffered for it.

House's clinic patients offered some comic relief in season one, and we still see some in season two, but not as many, and I missed them. We also see less of House watching soap operas. I guess since the show had become one there was less reason for him to watch them.

And finally, for reasons I can't explain, in a few shows this season I never quite understood what was wrong with the main patient. I never had that problem in season one, but somehow the part where we find out what the problem was seemed rushed at times in this season, to the point I missed it altogether in a few episodes.

In sum, I found season two to be a step down from season one in pretty much every respect. Most successful shows don't try to change things until the show has had a few years to get stale.
