Soon after I began viewing Texhnolyze, I wanted to hate this series. Why? Because I am sick and tired of anime that make you nod in or nod OFF in frustration, trying to figure out what is going on. I've had enough of anime that episode after episode introduces plot twists in noexistent plots and never come clean with the viewer as to its true meaning. Like some meta-anime that toys with you, offering you tantalizing little tidbits without any enlightenment. So far Texhnolyze is a series of this ilk. But strangely enough, I found myself intrigued by it and quite enjoyable in an avant garde kind of way.

The first episode or two is mainly seeing the characters breathing heavy and screaming, be it agony or bliss. It makes Speed Racer's gasps of fear seem like normal breathing. The plot starts to make a little more sense when the characters start talking. Lukuss is an underground city torn between rival gangs, one of which uses Texhnolyze, or cybernetic limb replacements as a status symbol, while the other sees pure organics as a rallying point. Ichise is a prize fighter who has somehow made the wrong people mad and suffers a lost arm and leg for his mistake. We also have other mysterious characters such as Ran, a clairvoyant girl who walks around in a fox mask and Yoshii, a visitor from the surface whose purposes are unknown.

Volume 1 is a decent start to a thought-provoking show whose very obtuse images and unclear storytelling give it a unique charm. Some of the scenes are quite mesmerizing even if you don't know what's going on. I feel that things will become clearer in later episodes. The character designs themselves hold a power little seen in other anime, and with the help of the voice actors, really convey a lot of emotion. There is an interview with the director and character designer included on this disk.
