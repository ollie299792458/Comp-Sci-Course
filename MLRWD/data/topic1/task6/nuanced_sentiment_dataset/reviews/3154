this is the problem with sequels. the only reason ghostbusters 2 was even made was because the first one was so good and so popular that audiences wanted so badly to see another one. so instead of taking the time out to  come up with another original blockbuster idea for a sequel, aykroyd and  ramis simply rushed out a script that was....mediocre at best. while the  specific story may have been different, the general concept was identical  to the first ghostbusters: an evil entity(gozer in part 1, vigo in part 2)  trying to enter the realm of earth through an earthly portal (dana's  refridgerator in part 1, the painting in part 2) and it's up to the  ghostbusters to prevent it from happening. what new ground was broken  there? why even bother with a sequel if you're not gonna break new ground?  what they did was basically make the same movie twice if you look at it.  with the DVD, why is it that the first ghostbusters is filled to the brim  with extras while part 2 has nothing but a few trailers? they could've done  a much better job than this.
