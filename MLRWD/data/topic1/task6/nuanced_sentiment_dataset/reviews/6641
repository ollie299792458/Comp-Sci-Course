I love the Ramones. I live in northern NJ where the Ramones were somewhat of a local bar band in the late 70's. They often played in clubs throughout North Jersey (the Show Place in Dover NJ, The Searchlight in Byram NJ, and others) and I was fortunate to see them about a dozen times in those early years. That being said I found this to be a lot of fun at times and tedious at others. There is no context to what you are watching and it is often left to the viewer to try to figure out where a segment is taking place and when it is happening. It is a bit of a jumbled mess. Some of the live segments are very good quality while others are poorly recorded hand held video cameras with poor sound quality. This video also gives you an idea that the Ramones had become fairly bored with each other (though they did come alive on stage). As mentioned by other reviewers this is a collection Marky's video and he does seem to annoy the other Ramones with his constant filming.
If you are a big Ramones fan you will love it. If you are a casual Ramones fan you will have trouble staying with it. If this is your first experience with the legenday Ramones, don't start with this video. You will get the wrong impression about this truly awesome band.
