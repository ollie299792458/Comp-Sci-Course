If your looking for a typical jack black movie like school of rock or pick of destiny this is not your cup of tea. But if your looking for a toned down jack black sharing time with mos def and danny glover among others then this is your film. The first 30 minutes set up the film as mos def works at a vhs movie rental store run by danny glover's character. Jack black works across the street. Jack black's character becomes magnetized (it makes sense in the movie and is kinda funny, reminded me of the chevy chase movie modern problems)and erases all the vhs movies. The second 30 minutes has black and mos recreate several of the movies hoping the customers won't notice. Highlights of their remakes include ghostbusters and rush hour 2. The community likes what they see and want's more of them. Also the city gov. wants to turn the video store into condos so they try and raise money by making a movie about a local lengendary bluesman. The last 30 minutes is less comedy and more a movie about friends and the community pulling together to help each other. Very nice movie with very little cussing and no nudity, good family film.
