Let me start off by saying I love Smokey & the Bandit.  I grew up with this movie, and learned such phases as "Smokey in a plain white wrapper," and "A Texas bubblegum machine."  I think there are still about 2-3 phases that Jackie Gleason says that even after about 100 viewings I still can't understand.  I purchased the first DVD relase back about 10 years ago for about $20.00 with no extras, so when I saw this special edition I was pretty excited... until I watched it.  Starting with the opening sequence with the semi-truck something was just off.  Then I heard the 77 Trans Am and knew what it was.  They redubbed a lot of the sounds.  I don't understand why they do this to movies that don't need to be redubbed.  Clean up the picture (which they did do, and that does look REALLY good, but leave the sound alone in movies like this that do not need redubbing.  You'd think as popular as "throwback" anything is in this day and ago that they would leave as much of these older movies alone as they could.  I guess if they did that the neard that sits around in a room and "fixes" all the sound in our older movies would be out of job.  In any event if you don't own this movie go ahead and pick it up for $9, but if you own the older DVD release, I'd stick with that one.
