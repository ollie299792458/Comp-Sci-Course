Oh, there's a message delivered in IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, but the movie is much more than that message. I know the standard take is that Rod Steiger's character is a racist who slowly begins to see the light, I don't think that's quite right. He's really not a bad guy, but he's lived in a small southern town all his life and he's never had to confront the laissez-faire racism that existed at that time (and may still). The rich family owns the town, the whites kowtow to them and the blacks are down on the next level. He's never thought twice about calling a black man "Boy."  Spending a couple of days with Virgil Tibbs opens his eyes to what a man (black or white) can be if he's allowed to be what he wants to be. But even still, the movie is not that simple. It's so non-PC. Virgil Tibbs is ruled by his pride. Not only does he never back down, he never acknowledges that Sherriff Gillespie is undergoing a transformation and he is on his side. Meanwhile, Sherriff Gillespie can't resist in maintaining his own pose. He constantly taunts Tibbs by calling him "Vir-gil." Tibbs and Gillespie are two great characters and they are brought to life by two amazing performances. At the end of the movie, there are no tearful good-byes, no admissions of misguided behavior, not even a handshake, but there is an unspoken understanding that something has happened and the two of them are better off because of it. When Tibbs boards the train and walks down the aisle, you can feel the stress leaving his body. It's as if he took in a deep breath at the beginning of the movie and has been finally allowed to exhale.
