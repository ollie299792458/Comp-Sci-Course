I saw this film years ago when it had its major theatrical release.  Years later, it remains as powerful.  The wonderful, odd vision of Peter Jackson (Director of LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) is put to use in this story of two young girls whose fantasy world runs amok.

I think it would be fair to say this is the breakout film that brought Kate Winslet to the well-deserved attention of a world market, but her co-star Melanie Lynskey gives the more complex performance of the two in this, if only because her role is given more layers.  The DVD is an uncut version, and it lends a different light to her sexuality than the version in theatres, but it is all still awkwardly (perfect for this story telling) ambivalent.

Jackson makes weird and wonderful use of the clay figures and fantasy land of the girls, and although I don't really think he has a full handle on what a girl's fantasy land would be made of (this one was awfully muddy - ick),  it is still a compelling, complete and disturbing vision - all fitting.  There are truly great moments which feels completely, messily, real.  Sarah Peirse's entire performance is wonderful, as the more downtrodden and distressed mother. This is really fine acting.

Not long after the film was released, the actual case this was based on was re-opened, and it was found that, as part of their "treatment," the girls were given a drug to sedate them, but it has since been shown to cause extreme violent outbursts.  It is too bad this information could not have been available as the film was made.  I believe Jackson could have incorporated this and made the film even richer.  But that would be icing.  This is a true story, and a truly wonderful film of it.
