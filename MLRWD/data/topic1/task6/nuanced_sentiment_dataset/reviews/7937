I see a lot of people did not care for season 3 of Weeds.  While I did get the sense that, Nancy will never win and got frustrated at her life/circumstances (won't give anything away)...I still really enjoyed this season and am ready to watch Season 4!

I thought this season showed us a new side of many characters, Celia, Silas, Shane, Andy and Dean.  I liked how the cliff hanger from season 2 was dealt with.  And in each half hour there was enough drama that at the end of each show you were ready to watch the next one to see what was going to happen.

My only complaint with Weeds is that the plot seems to be repeating with regards to Nancy and nearly getting caught selling, then her being in debt to someone etc.  I've finished season 4, and that's what has made me a little dismayed at the fact that it does seem to be the same formula over & over...but I'm waiting till Season 5 to make up my mind on that.

Again, I think Showtime has hit paydirt with an original, fun show.  The half hour format is what does it for me, something quick to pop in and sit back and relax to.  Even more, the cast and crew makes this show a shining star in a dark night of boring TV.
