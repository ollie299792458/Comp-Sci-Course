Noticing the movie was given an overall 4 star rating by other Amazon reviewers we purchased and watched this movie. I had no knowledge of the movie other than what I've seen here, on Amazon. Kevin Spacey and John Cusack are first rate actors..... when they're in a movie with some substance. Midnight in Garden of Good & Evil is not a movie with substance.
The overall plot was disjointed and difficult to follow. A writer is engaged by a magazine to write about a society party in Savannah. That's about the only "normal" event of the movie. The people of Savannah are made to appear like fools. There's an underlying homosexual agenda that is unwanted. There's a "voodoo" priestess slipping in and out of scenes for no apparent reason. Her character is not well defined nor is the reason for her occasionally popping up.
The movie is poorly written with most scenes leaving the viewer wondering what they're talking about or trying to figure out why the actors are doing what they're doing. The actors are inconsistent with the characters they portray because of poor writing.
The one kinda bright spot in the movie is Lady Chablis as Chablis Deveau. Great role, great acting here and the only reason I give the movie 2 stars instead of 1.
