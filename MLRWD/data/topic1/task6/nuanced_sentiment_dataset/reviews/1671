It's hard to believe this film has "fallen through the cracks", and is almost unknown. Burt Lancaster is a marshal rounding up cowhands who shot up his town and accidentally killed a citizen. He's so insistent on following "the rules" that he's unwilling to consider a reasonable compromise, such as letting Lee J Cobb bribe the judge. (As Lancaster admits, he's not a hanging judge, and the hands would probably get off with a fine, bribe or no bribe.)

The only person with common sense is the sheriff, Robert Ryan, who's under Cobb's thumb, with no power to do the right thing. Once Cobb's business partner threatens Lancaster and is killed, the possibility of a sensible solution evaporates, and the body count mounts. The ending is brutal and heartbreaking; have a Kleenex or two handy.

"Lawman" is thematically similar to "Unforgiven", with everyone working toward their own misguided idea of justice. The script generally avoids pompous declamations and finds ways of freshening clich&eacute;s. (I particularly liked the euphemism for "pissed his pants" -- "wet between the legs".)

The transfer is from a good theatrical print. Other than the reel-change marks, there's only an occasional speck or scratch. Colors are muted in a plausible "old-West" way, but blood sometimes looks like red paint. (Probably because it /is/ red paint.)

The sound is atrocious. It's almost always coarse, and the dialog often switches between the original on-set recording and studio looping. (The credits list a dialog editor, suggesting that a lot of editing was needed.)

The PG rating was given at a time when PG-13 didn't exist. Though the violence isn't particularly brutal (mostly "clean" gunshots with blood squibs), the ending is shocking, and not appropriate for pre-teens.

Strongly recommended.
