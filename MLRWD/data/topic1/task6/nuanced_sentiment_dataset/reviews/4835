PA2 is a weak prequel/sequel and delivers very little in every area. The storyline is simple and provides as few details as possible. For instance, what's going on down in the basement? No explanation is provided and you are left clueless.

The makers introduce some new and interesting characters but fail to develop and adequately use (I loved the housekeeper angle but she was fired). There are few scares here, but be warned, there is one in the kitchen that will make you jump out of your skin.

The big problem here is this is a prequel/sequel and you've seen it all before. It's a quick 'cash-in' sequel that does not tamper with the formula behind the success of PA. For me it wasn't as good the second time around (even the ouija board is back). I found the constant shifting from one camera angle to another a major distraction for me.

In closing, I found PA2 to be amateurish and magnified by the film's many shortcomings. If you are on the fench about buying this one rent it first. I think you will thank me later.
