Although a brilliant movie, there are three problems with My Fair Lady on DVD: 1) the movie was designed to be viewed on the big screen, 2) the audio commentary is poor and 3) Audrey Hepburn.

1) Cukor shot this movie as a direct adaptation from the stage, which was appropriate for theatrical release, but not for home viewing. For example, a great deal of action in this movie is conveyed via the actor's facial expressions. However, Cukor frequently includes wide-angle shots that encompass the entire set. Appropriate enough for the theatre, but a great deal is lost when viewing at home, even on a larger flat-screen monitor.

2) I listened to about an hour of the audio commentary and then could bear no more. It is largely a bitching session about how difficult it was to restore the film, containing technical detail appropriate for a UCLA film school student, but not the general public.

3) Audrey Hepburn was a great actor. I've seen a number of her films on the big screen at the Stanford Theatre (a wonderfully restored theatre in Palo Alto that screens the classics). However, Audrey overacts Eliza the guttersnipe and her lip sync performance is embarrassing. She nearly recovers with her Ascot performance, which is absolutely stunning and hilarious. This is Audrey at her best. However, clearly this is a role meant for Julie Andrews. Like Rex Harrison, Julie mastered this role on the stage, and she would have been absolutely perfect in the movie.
