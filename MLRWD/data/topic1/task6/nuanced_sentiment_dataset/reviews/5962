I own the Superman/Batman graphic novel that this is based on. I thought it was an excellent retelling of the story. Between the beautiful animation, the fight scenes, and the great voice acting I really enjoyed it. However, I do feel Darkseid was miscast. Andre Braugher has a good voice but not a DARKSEID voice.

As I woman and a huge comic book geek, I loved all the strong females. Wonder Woman, Big Barda, etc... But I have to say, I am a HUGE Batman fan, and this is truly a Superman and Supergirl story. I thought that Batman lost some of his presence here, he is almost a minor supporting character.

They leave a few holes in the story that could only be fleshed out if they had made a longer movie. For instance, why was Kara still a teenager when her ship left Krypton at the same time Clark's ship left? They explain that in the book.

***SLIGHT SPOILER FOR THOSE WHO DONT KNOW THE STORY*** The ending is a little different and I have to say. I like the way the movie ends as opposed to the book.

All in all, it is great story and a great movie and any FanBoy or Girl should give it a look-see. This is another home run from DC animated.  Sigh..if only they would remake Hush.

BTW, I loved the Green Arrow short, that should have been a movie.

The other "extras" here, with the exception of the sneak peek of All Star Superman are a C-.
