I was fortunate to have seen the AFI Lifetime Achievement Award bestowed to Henry Fonda for his career full of memorable films given to him in the late 70's. In that particular ceremony, Mister Roberts was featured prominently and rightfully so as it was one of his most memorable roles. At the end of the show, getting inspiration to one of the classic scenes of the movie, those who attended and paid tribute to Mister Fonda that ranges from Bette Davis to Barbra Stanwyck, to Jimmy Stewart and to Ensign Pulver himself Jack Lemmon, one by one stood up and did the "Goodnight, Mister Roberts" from the movie but it was adapted in the ceremony by changing it to "Goodnight, Mister Fonda". That was one beautiful moment.

Mister Roberts (Fonda) was the cargo officer of a battle ship that does not happen to participate in actual battles. He is considered a hero by the crew and one of the reasons was that he was the only one who can fight back the cruel captain played by James Cagney. Mister Robert's kindness and camaraderie to the crew was exploited by the captain to control Mister Robert's subordination at the expense of Mister Robert's goal to be transferred in the battlefield. But of course the crew made sure that won't happen.

Henry Fonda was perfect. I can't think of anyone who could play the title character with the dignity and quiet heroism that he showed in the movie. Jack Lemmon stole some scenes and I was truly delighted to see his unique comic timing that became so distinctively associated with him. James Cagney, played the captain with such "barking" intensity you'll hate his guts.

This is one of my all time favorite movies and I highly recommend it.
