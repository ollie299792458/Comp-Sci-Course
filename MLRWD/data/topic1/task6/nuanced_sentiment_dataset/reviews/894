American Graffiti is one of my favorite films, and I was glad to get a copy of it on DVD.  I found the picture quality on this DVD edition to be stunning, but as I watched it I noticed immediately that the sound track was playing a half step sharp, putting all the songs in the film in a higher key.  Most people probably will not notice this but it was a major disappointment for me, as it will be for any other viewer who is sensitive to pitch.  Only at the end of the DVD is there any indication that the picture has been "compressed," as many films seem to be that have been reissued on VHS and DVD.  Only in the accompanying documentary, where fragments of some of the songs are used, are the songs played at their normal speed.  I cannot understand why there is no information on the box cover that warns the buyer about this misrepresentation of the soundtrack, which in fact it is.  I reasonably assumed that the DVD version, labeled "Collector's Edition" would be a faithful reproduction of the film as it appeared in theaters, but this is not the case with regard to the sound track.  I cannot understand why this "compressing," if indeed that is the cause, is applied to movies, unless it is to shorten their running time. If you are not sensitive to pitch, then you probably won't notice the fact that the songs are heard a half step sharp.  But if you are, this DVD version could be intolerable to you and a big disappointment, as it was to me.
