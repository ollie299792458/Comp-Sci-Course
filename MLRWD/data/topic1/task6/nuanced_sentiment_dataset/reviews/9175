This is my favorite movie of all time.  The action and fight choreography to this movie are so fast and powerful, that you'll be either frozen in awe, or jumping in excitement.  This movie has more too: the acting is very  good, the humor is very funny, and the setting is perfect.  I have seen  many martial arts movies of all types, from the Shaw Bros. productions - to  the new Hong Kong films of the present, and I have to say that this is the  greatest Martial Arts Film Ever!  I have seen "Fist of Legend",  "Enter the Dragon", "Once Upon a Time in a China",  "Iron Monkey", and countless others, but Drunken Master 2  surpasses them in every aspect, especially the fight choreography.  Every  fight is a sight to behold.  Too many new Martial Arts movies these days  use strings and camera tricks too much, but Jackie kept it realistic, and  what a difference it makes!  When I watched the end fight scene to this  film, I couldn't blink, and my jaw had dropped open in amazement.  The  fight scene in the end is the most earth-shattering, mind-boggling,  jaw-dropping, incredibly amazing fight I have ever seen.  I still get  chills when I see it.  This movie is a blessing.  Thank You, Jackie Chan.
