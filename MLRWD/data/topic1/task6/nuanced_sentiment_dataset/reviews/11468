I'am a true Peanuts fan and absolutely had to buy this set of episodes, It really makes me happy watching my favorite characters like Marcie, Peppermint Patty, Lucy Van Pelt, Linus Van Pelt and of course "the one and only" Charlie Brown and much more. This set is from the 60's of the Peanuts years (the oldest time of the Peanuts) And truly one of the best years of the Peanuts. The DVD consists of the famous Emmy Award winner "A Charlie Brown Christmas" which was made in the mid 60's (1965) and "It's The Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown" another famous-made episode from the mid 60's (1966) along with other cherished classics from the 60's that all are in this DVD collection. It also includes the other famous episode "Charlie Brown's All-Stars" (1966) along with plenty more cherished Peanuts episodes on the DVD collection. I'll list the episodes:
"A Charlie Brown Christmas" (1965)
"Charlie Brown's All-Stars" (1966)
"It's The Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown" (1966)
"You're In Love Charlie Brown" (1967)
Disc Two:
"He's Your Dog Charlie Brown" (1968)
"It Was A Short Summer Charlie Brown" (1969)
Those were the episodes, I hope that helped. Here is the special features:
