I was hesitant to see this movie due to it being a GAY COWBOY MOVIE. Not that I have anything against gay people (some of my best friends have been gay) I just don't particularly care for Westerns and was scared this would be boring.

Boy was I wrong.

Brokeback Mountain had my attention from start to finish. And what is even surprising to me is... I liked it. It made me cry at the end. It was very moving. Very heartfelt. Very heartbreaking. It is an emotional roller coaster.

What do you do if you fall in love with someone you can't have? You carry that flame for 4 years and once you see one another again... the flame becomes a fire that consumes both of you with passion, desire, and love? Love is the hardest thing to admit to and the hardest thing to let go of. This movie, shows how beautiful love can be... and also how heartbreaking it really is.

See it even if you don't LIKE that kind of movie. You don't see any sex really... you see naked man bum but that is all. It isn't all perverted gay sex with nudity. Seriously. All you do see is a few bums and that is all. I promise. The story isn't about SEX it is about love... a deep love... and a deep regret.

I really think the lesson of the story was Never Put off love... you have to grasp it and hold onto it... or one day, you could loose it forever... and you will be left with nothing but regrets.
