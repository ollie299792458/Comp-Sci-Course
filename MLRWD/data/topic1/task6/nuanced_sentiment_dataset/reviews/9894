I saw incendiary after I was unable to view it in theaters, I was going to buy the film without viewing it however, I decided to rent it before and the movie was a bit of a disappointment it is boring and long, and the ending is a bit unclear. Then I decided to read the book that had been sitting on my bookshelf for a while. And I am happy I did the adapted film is joke compared to the book which is creative and original plus many parts in the film are not in the book and the characters are poorly adapted. Their is too much to even mention that is not in the movie, and the sequence where Michelle Williams stalks the boy who is the son of one of the terrorist is not a major part or even part of the book. I would suggest buying the book instead of the film, which spends too much time on politics instead of the books creativity and interesting characters. One the poor examples of adaptation is in the film it looks like she does not love her husband but in the book she does. whats the point of that?<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439157170">Incendiary: A Novel</a>
