Generally speaking, I found Beyond Borders very entertaining.  However, I felt it suffered very significantly from an inability to decide whether it's a love story or a piece of social commentary.  In the end, both the romantic plot and the social commentary suffered.
Clive Owen does, as per usual, does a spectacular job.  And Angelina Jolie, as per usual, gives a more than adequate performance.  The relationship between their characters, however, lacked heat I was expecting.  From the perspective of the audience, their relationship also seemed to lack a bit of history.  They went from barely knowing each other to being secretly in love.  Perhaps some scenes were left on the cutting room floor or perhaps it was supposed to be "understood."  Either way, it didn't work.
The social commentary does get fairly heavy at times.  However, with the love story struggling to maintain the interest of the audience, I can understand how some critics would feel that the movie trivializes the struggles of international relief workers.
Overall, I would recommend this as simply an entertaining movie for a Friday night or an enjoyable piece for someone who lives either Clive Owen or Angelina Jolie.  If you're looking for something beyond that, keep looking.
