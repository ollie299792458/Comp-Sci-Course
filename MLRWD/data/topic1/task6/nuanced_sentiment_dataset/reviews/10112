Wang is a street performer, the self proclaimed king of Masks. He is a man getting up there in age, and he soon realizes the need for an heir. But his art is a long time family secret, passed down only through the male generation. But in 1920's China, boys are coveted whereas girls are thrown to the side. He buys a child on the street, only to find out too late that his little boy is actually a little girl. King of Masks is a story about a man so bound by tradition he denies his fate, leading to one tragedy and misfortune after another.

Although engaging, and at times heart rendering, I would call King of Masks a mediocore film. Even through all the tragedy I knew that everything would turn out alright in the end. It was fairly predictable.

The characters were very likeable. Wang was a very endearing man, and Doggie was the cutest thing. But I don't think the film expanded enough on their relationship. In fact at one point I was unclear whether Wang had kicked the girl out, or she had run away.

 There were times, also, when the story felt rushed, and some ends were left loose. Such as explaining what exactly the purpose of kidnapping the children were.

As a whole, although fairly entertaining, it did not offer the depth that I hoped it would.
