All the critics hated it.  About half the people who have reviewed it here hate it.  I'm with the other half.  I love this film -- I've watched it at least seven times and it's still entertaining.  It kind of reminds me of people's reaction to Chronicles of Riddick -- I happened to love that film but critics panned it and a lot of people thought the film less than stellar.

There IS a moral center to the film and, yes, this is essentially a remake of Fistful of Dollars (one of my favorite films).

Bruce Willis does a great job playing the cool, opportunistic mystery man on the run (from who knows what).  What you'll find out about 10 minutes into the movie is that this is going to be a shoot-em up with fantastic gun play. Over the top, glorious and very cool double fisted Colt 45 action with clips dropping from the handles kind of gun play.

Acting is well done Dern, Willis.. heck, just about everybody did a good job in this film.  These aren't no name actors.. this is quite a cast and I'm only sorry this film has been given such a rough time by a lot of folks.

If you don't like violence, can't stand pulp fiction heroes, a dark story line, and don't like mobster movies/westerns then don't even consider this flick.
