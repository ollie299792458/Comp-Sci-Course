I am the CEO of a big company and although I of course never would do some of the things that go on in this movie, its the kind of movie that gets your business blood pumping!  I recently was involved in a big M&A deal and my brother was calling me everyday with some line from the movie...  "Greed is Good",  "Money Never Sleeps Pal" stuff like that.  It was bringing back old memories so I bought him and I each the 20th anniversary edition!  What a classic!  Its everything you wish you could do but never would!

Put Michael Douglass with Charlie and Martin Sheen and its a great entertaining movie!  First half is priceless with young Bud (Charlie) trying to land the big Whale (Douglas as Gordon Gecko).  Greed eventually crosses the line the end is predictable but there is a very good reason why so many businessmen love this movie!  Having Daryl Hannah nude in a bedroom scene with Charlie is a "bonus" guy track!

Give it with Boiler Room as a great one two punch since Boiler Room has a fantastic scene of those actors (Vin Diesel and Giovanni Ribisi) watching Wall Street on TV and acting it out in Vin's living room word for word.

Great Guy Gift, its timeless and never falls short of entertaining!
