I enjoyed it........my son enjoyed it and I REALLY appreciate the alternative ending. But it failed to live up to the hype that Jerry B and Antoine generated.

Visually it had some great moments - the richness of a beautiful English summer........the drama of the frozen lake.......the gruesome battles.

The dialogue however was lamentable.......bad, bad, bad......all the best lines seemed to go to the illiterate saxons........maybe they contributed to the script!

Then you have the plain silliness......if you ride for two days north from Hadrians wall in the height of summer there is no snow........ANYWHERE! So, no frozen lake either. Why have the woads speaking their own language and then have the locals north of the wall with Dick Van Dyke London accents? Then there's the wall..........as it still exists how come the basic design was ignored? Any decent wall of the time would have a substantial ditch to deter would be attackers.......no CGI budget?

Worst of all?........the ending. Why? A combination of schmaltz and sheer lack of creativity.

So, what was potentially a great opportunity for retelling a great tale with guts, reality, panache and substance was tossed away leaving us wanting for a more capable handing in the future.
