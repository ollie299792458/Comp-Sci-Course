Let me say right off that The Stand is my favorite novel, and having read it several times I was hoping for a lot from the movie. Therefore, I tried to watch it with a positive attitude, but I must admit it was lacking the character depth (and some of the characters) that made the book so great. Where was Rita? She was a driving force for Larry, and she should have been in there somewhere. And Joe! He was such an interesting character, and yet he had about 5 minutes of screen time.  The biggest mistake they made was casting Corin Nemic as Harold. He was supposed to be a genius, not a nerd, and he was fat, whereas Nemic was skinny as a rail.  There were pluses, though. Rob Lowe was excellent as Nick Andros, and I had high expectations for him as he is my favorite character. Jamey Sheridan was acceptable as Flagg, though he wasn't exactly as I pictured him. The ending still left me in tears.  If you liked the book, then you probably shouldn't see the movie. There are just too many missing elements.
