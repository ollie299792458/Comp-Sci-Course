The Man Who Never Was creates a solid war movie that is better known for the plot, but not for the suspense. The plot is billiant...plant fake invasion plans on corpse, and hope the Germans fall for the  bait.
Unfortunately, good plot movies end up "connect the dot"  themes unless there is real suspense. Everthing goes pretty much according  to plan and we don't have the "Dial M For Murder" or the "39  Steps" type of intrigue. For example, the British pretty much rubber  stamp this project, despite the severity of the plan. Yes, there is  discussion of the plan, but one could be arguing for more orders of  ballpoint pens versus inkwell pens. Then, the villain, the one who is  supposed to check out the story, pretty much covers a routine checklist  that any failed detective would follow. It is not clear why he would go to  extremes of sacrificing his life to determine the validity of the plot.  There is little character development. Surely, there would have been better  ways to obtain the truth, especially once he gets most of the clues. For  example, the non-membership of the deceased at the club...following Lucy to  see if she goes to any memorial services, etc. The villain would thus be  hidden and not expose his identity.
Still, one should not be too harsh.  The plot is based on a true story and this itself gives admiration to the  wartime effort of the British to beat the Germans. One can only imagine the  courage of the Bristish soldier( played by Clifton Webb) in a formalized  structure of the British hierarchy to not only propose this plot but to  execute it. But that is why we are really ready to dodge some bullets and  swing at the curve balls.I think then we would have gotten a better flavor  of the team work needed to make this plot work. Then this would have been a  great movie rather just a good one.
