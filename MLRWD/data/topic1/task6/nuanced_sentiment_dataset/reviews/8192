I saw this movie at a drive-in theater in Memphis Tennessee when it was first released.
It was the first of it's kind and scared the bejabbers out of everybody who saw it.
I told a friend about it and invited him to go but (Believe it or not) the local censor had banned it after the first showing.
The censor was taken to court and told he couldn't ban a movie and shortly thereafter it was showing again.
The thing was so scary for it's time that the drive-in had to extend the concession period, (The break between movies so people could go to the concession stand and buy food and popcorn) because people were afraid to leave their cars.
I took friends on several occasions to see it and almost every time when the movie was over people would sit in their cars waiting for someone else to make the first move.
After a short period the first car door would open, then another and then another.
People would line up and head for the concession stand together.
Inevitably some joker somewhere in the line would loudly begin to moan and go into his staggering zombie routine.
The girls would scream and everybody would break and run for the concession stand at the same time.
Years later when my son was about ten and had a friend spending the night we rented some movies including this one and I told them they were going to see the scariest movie ever made.
Fifteen minutes into it they were bored and wanted to watch something else.
Go figure.
The thing still gives me the willies.
I guess you had to be there when it first came out.
As a piece of movie history it's worth owning and knowing some of the history might make it more enjoyable for those who were not there.
