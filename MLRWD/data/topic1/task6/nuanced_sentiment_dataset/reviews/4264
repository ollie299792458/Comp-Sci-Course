If anyone is familiar with the history of The Seeker's production, you already know that it was very loosely adapted from the books by a fundamentalist director.  Besides the issue that Will suddenly was made older & "modernised", the adaptation completely missed the point of the book series.  The books were definately written for children rather for an all ages audience (the story is not necessarily about the "hero's journey" or "coming of age" issues, but rather about young children trying to understand unexplained forces & issues of the world through mysterious events, magic & adventure), but they did have some interesting comments on children grappling with different forces of the world.  This film simplifies and changes the main concepts and has among the most uninteresting dialogues I've heard, very poor character development & predictable plot.  (if I wanted to see a Christian-themed fantasy, I'd rather see the Narnia films, even with all their faults or watch LOTR or The Exorcist again).

It's one of the worst movie adaptations I have seen since the Earthsea Chronicles.  I rented it even though I read bad reviews, but wanted to give this film a chance since I love this subgenre so much.  I gave it one star for the presence of Christopher Eccleston.

A film does not have to be an exact adaptation, but should still carry forth the basic essence of the novel that is being adapted.

If you are in the mood to see some fun fantasy film based on good books, there is so much to choose from, such as the Harry Potter series, the European version/television series of Wrinkle in Time, Stardust, Spiderwick Chronicles (could have been better dialogue, but some of the characters are very charming), The Water Horse (surprisingly one of the best children's book adaptations of 2007) and Golden Compass (very Hollywood, but can be good depending on the next film).
