Vash the Stampede is compassion, courage, determination, and comedy personified.  It is no wonder that the viewer, much like the characters Vash encounters in the story, immediately become attached to the central figure of this classic set which starts off innocently lighthearted but soon turns into a gripping and often dark exploration of Vash's destiny and a past that haunts him at every turn.  
The outlaw feared and referred to as the Humanoid Typhoon is a walking, gun-toting contradiction.  
He'll never kill anyone (bad or good) and yet mass destruction follows him wherever he goes.  Vash always has a knee-jerk junevile reaction whenever a pretty girl enters the room but often follows up the very next moment with a deep philosophical insight or question into humanity.  The juxtapositions keep the story from becoming too dark when the story takes its dramatic twists.  
The supporting characters are also great.  The 26 episodes give ample time for each character to go beyond the superficial facades and dig deep into their pasts. 
Each mystery (such as the origin of Vash's mechanical left arm, and even the reason why Vash wears red) is explained beautifully and grippingly in sequences of cutscenes throughout.  The many Christian imageries and allegories, intentional or not, were very touching.
The voice acting by the way are top notch and fits perfectly to each character.
I daresay that very few things in American TV or movie theaters can hold a Mayfly to the heart and action found in this wonderful set.
