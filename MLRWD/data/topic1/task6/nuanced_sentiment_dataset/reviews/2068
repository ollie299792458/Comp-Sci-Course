After watching season one as a group, season two seemed overproduced and formulaic. Pierce Brosnan became a star in the first season, so the show revolved around him in the second. Fox and Murphy hated Remington Steele, but they are replaced by Doris Roberts, whose fawning made me want to puke by the middle of the season.

Doris herself is awesome, but the writing is predictable, every episode is rammed full of stunts, and Remington and Laura bicker so constantly about being dissatisfied with each other that they started to remind me of car rides with my grandparents. Then they kiss. It's really stupid.

The same supporting characters started showing up again and again as different people and Laura got a loft replacing the house because lofts are "cool". (Did they pick up a producer from The Love Boat or something?)

Laura is no longer independent and in control. Instead they write her as needy and sulky. That blows most of all. The pilot concept was based on a woman making her way in a man's world and Stephanie was perfect for that part, but the second season did to her exactly what Laura was fighting in the original concept.

Even the opening changes to self-referential Hollywood weirdness in which Laura and Remington sit with popcorn in an empty movie theater watching themselves on the big screen. If the actors weren't so great, I would have hated the second season.
