After 5 straight weeks of sleepless nights, my husband and I were walking zombies. Our infant would wake every hour to 2 hours throughout the night and just scream.  During the day she would also scream uncontrollably - even though the doctor found nothing wrong with her physically.  I had convinced myself that she just wasn't a happy baby like our 6 year old was and life with Isabel would be tough!
Then I searched Amazon one night under "Colic" and found this book and video.  Even though we have absolutely no time to read, we did watch the video (while she wailed).  My husband tried the swaddling and shhing techniques that night and she quieted down after about 10 minutes.  Now 1 week later she calms after 5 min or so AND she is sleeping 4 hours at a time.  We feel great and she finally looks peaceful - and not agitated.
Both the book and video are geared toward the first 3 months of life.... and the notion that most babies 1st 3 months of life are really the 4th trimester in their developement.  Our first child slept soundly from day one..... but we were blown away with this second one.  Thank you Dr. Karp!  We finally feel like humans again and the stress level in our home has dropped tremendously.
