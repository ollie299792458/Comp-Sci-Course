I really like this movie.  I think it is a very beautifully shot, non-pretentious, interesting, and entertaining movie.  So why do the powers that be insist on splicing in a scene that looks and is acted so badly it stands out like a sore thumb?  It even has a jarring awful transition into the scene in a movie otherwise full of beautiful transitions.
If you don't know the story of this scene, here it is in brief.  The Director and Producers decided not to shoot the scene where Conner meets Rachael, to save some money.  During editing they changed their minds, and paid, out-of-pocket to set up and shoot that scene.  They called back Christopher Lambert and got some child actor and quickly slapped the scene together.  With the scene shot they went back to editing and spliced the footage in and decided it looked really bad and took it out again.
Fast forward to the release of the Directors-Cut and the only way to justify a Directors-Cut--by inserting this terrible footage.  Now I can't get a DVD version without this awful scene.
If this scene had been done properly (as in budgeted for, and done when Lamberts regular make-up person was there (I keep asking myself if this is what a person looks like on film with no make-up, or just with really really bad make-up), and if Lambert had felt like acting that day ) this could have been a very beneficial scene for the movie--but as it stands it's not.
I give the original release of Highlander 5 stars.  The current versions with all its "improvements" I can only give 2 stars.
All I wanted was a decent DVD transfer of the original movie.
