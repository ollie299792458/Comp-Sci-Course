This is another one of my all-time favorite movies, Jody Foster has the ability to speak, though her words are learned from her ailing mother.  Nell lives with her Mother in a heavily wooded area, which is found out later Nell's Mother owns.  Being a product of rape Nell and Maye-her twin sister were born.  Maye had passed when she was around 10.  Nell was left behind to take care of their Mother.  The movie begins with Nell wailing out about losing her Mother, possibly due to a stroke, who has now moved onto 'walking with the Lord'.  When she is discovered by a Doctor, after the local delivery guy attempted to deliver the groceries when he heard Nell's constant wails, the Doctor has to decide what he should do, let Nell go into an Institution for experimental abuse, or should he try to learn the life and ways of Nell.  He decides to work with Nell, along with a Social Worker?  They watch Nell for 3 months and learned so much from Nell.  Did she really need them, or did they really need her?  If you watch the movie very carefully it will take you from one extreme to another, from Nell being afraid to go out during the day, to Nell wanting to go out and stay out enjoying the sunshine.  Until trouble arrives and nearly scares her out of her skin.  She has no idea about the big world she has missed for her entire life.  Until the Doctor and the Social Worker spend alot of time with her.  This is a very emotional movie, especially if there was a loss in your life like close to what she has displayed in this charactor.  "Like Trees In The Wind", get the movie you will know what I mean.  :)

Incredible.
