It takes a lot to make me give a one-star review, but this film has earned it.

First, in order to be capital A R T, the main character has to die in the end, otherwise it isn't.  This film is A R T.  Can't have anybody getting better in the end or getting it together!

Second, other than the main character dying (off stage of course, we can't have her die on stage, that would be melodrama)--other than that, in order for it to be A R T, nothing has to happen for the entire film.  This film is A R T.

It's challenging to make a film in which nothing happens, and Art-filmmaker wannabes work hard at it.  This one takes a more direct approach.  She has people sitting around taking drugs for 90 out of 94 minutes and mumbling incoherently.  How many different ways can you take drugs and stumble around and mumble?

Third, throw in background music that is also A R T--no, don't get me wrong!  Not classical music!  That isn't A R T !!!  This one makes sure you get that it's A R T by putting a loud high-pitched hum on the soundtrack for the first five minutes.  A R T -- get it?

Fourth, to make sure nobody is tempted to do some independent thinking, drop some names--Barthes, Derrida, etc.--that'll intimidate anybody.

And show some boring photographs and DARE anyone to say they're boring.

Oh, and that R rating?  And the nudity?  Gonzo!  This film is PG.  Or maybe PG-13 because of all the drug use.

In short, this film has absolutely nothing going for it.  If you want high value in this film, you'll have to supply it yourself.  Maybe you could invest in the acting--must take talent, after all, to stumble around and mumble incoherently, sway and roll your eyes.  Maybe you could come up with something else.  But you'll have to do it, because this film is not going to help you out.  It's up to you!
