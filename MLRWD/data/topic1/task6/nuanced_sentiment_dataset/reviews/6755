Vanishing is an interesting "horror" movie, in which the lead characters suddenly find that the sunlight dies out and that you're taken by "alien" beings if you're not exposed to light. Think vampires, only in reverse. The principle makes for suspense, and I personally have not seen it in a film before, but it's just not enough to keep the film going. It would've worked better if it were just one of the elements of the film. Take as an analogy the MacGyver series -- the fact that he jury-rigs all kinds of tools and devices to solve tasks is what makes the series memorable, but how much fun would you have if each episodes was just MacGyver spending 45 minutes on inventing something?

That's the impression I got from Vanishing -- "if it gets too dark around you, you disappear" sounds like just one of many "rules" in a story, and just doesn't do it as a main plot device. The abandoned Roanoke colony is written into the story, without this adding to anything -- in fact it just seems shoehorned, as the colony had nothing whatsoever to do with "people disappearing because it got dark".
