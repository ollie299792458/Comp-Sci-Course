I love a good action movie.  But unless you are the target audience for this movie (13 year old males) this is not the movie to see.  The dark, vulgar undertones of this movie traumatized my nervous system almost as much as the loud continuous noise and explosions that did not cease from film beginning to film end.  The special effects attempted to be breathtaking, but the CGI in this film was poor at best.  Many times I found myself shaking my head as Vin Diesel rushed into danger in a clearly fake CGI world.  Then there is the acting and script.  What acting and script?  I truly think that they were making this up as they went along.  Have we really sunk this low that we are expected to be entertained with noise, explosions, and special effects without the benefit of meaningful acting and scripting.  I feel insulted.  The only redeeming factor of this movie (and I mean the only redeeming factor) was Samuel L. Jackson's performance.  But this was not enough to salvage this poor excuse for a movie.  This really could be the worst movie ever made.
