I saw Chocolate a few months before Raging Phoenix came out so i had a good idea of what to expect. Jeeja Yanin seems like a female equivalent of Tony Jaa, a little limited as far as physical capabilities in comparison to Tony Jaa, however still very impressive. Chocolate touted the "no wires" banner proudly as Ong Bak did, Raging Phoenix tries to fly the same sign, but is deceitful in this endeavor.

There are a couple things wrong with this movie. The story doesn't flow very smoothly. There are segments where they try to build more character and flush out the story, but this is a mistake because none of the characters are that compelling and the story is too shallow at its core to handle a lot of attention.

The hook, as far as the action scenes go, is that the fighting style for the lead characters is a mix of dance, drunk and tai styles. They only employ this style for the first half of the movie. They eventually abandon this style and fall into more spectacle styles. Wires and padding is used liberally, especially towards the end of the film.

Jeeja Yanin's character is represented as "badass" on the cover but she ends up spending most of her screen time covered in her own blood. She's beaten, battered, captured, stripped, beaten some more, and forced to shotgun tequila. She is anything BUT a badass. If anything at all, she's a victim of many more powerful and aggressive characters than herself, and barely has hopes of making it out of any confrontation alive.

It may sound like i have a lot of criticism for this movie, but it's mostly coming from failed expectations of what i thought it would provide. The fights in here are well choreographed. The acting is passable. The music is terrible. For fans of tai films and/or jeeja yanin should see Raging Phoenix, all others should stay very far away.
