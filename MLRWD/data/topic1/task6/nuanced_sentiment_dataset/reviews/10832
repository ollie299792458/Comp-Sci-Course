When I first heard of Alexander Payne making a follow up to Election (one of the best films of the 90's), I was thrilled. And to top it off, it was going to star one of the greatest actors of all time, Jack Nicholson (see One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). Without hesitation, I went to see the film and was surprised. 
About Schmidt takes it's time. Really. Jack doesn't speak for the first 15 minutes, but we see him there. We get introduced to his painful retirement and then his life with at home with his wife, how his wife dies and he trys to live on his own. But the film doesn't really pick up until a good 40 minutes into it, when Jack tries to stop his daughter from marrying a total whack-job, but after that, it's a treat. Nicholson gets into character and many humorous moments occur, but the film still crawls along. The film then gets its glow and quirky-ness from Kathy Bates and the screwball family his daughter is about to marry into. It's all funny from there on in, but turns sad once he makes an emotional speech at his daughter's speech and realizes he has failed to stop his daughter, and, altogether, touch anyone's life. I gave the film it's 4 star rating for the sheer ending of the film, which is, in a way, happy and sad at the same time. Payne's film crawls along for the first 40 mins to an hour, but is then redeemed by Nicholson's performance, Bate's performance, and the wonderful ending. 
This is one you just have to see for yourself, but even if you wanna bail 20 minutes in, just stick around and you might be surprised.
