This nice looking and surprising western had a great premise, but was slowed down with not enough nicely cherographed action sequences, along with a miss-cast of the leading man.

Hugh Jackman, along with not so high-dollar actors could have played this leading role to better execution.

The storyline was excellent, but the pacing and the skinny, boring lead actor made this hard to swallow.

The special effects, especially near the ending, would have been more exciting - and more properly executed - if the Good and Evil spirits would have battled it out.

Instead, we are thrown in some cool looking images...but quickly had me and my friends saying - "Enough already!"

I love half-breed type westerns, and the filming and scenes in this movie are magnificent, but the lack of a strong lead actor, along with scenes that felt unfinished and/or polished, made this film in much need of some explosive, Sam Peckinpah-type action.

Look up DUST.  That's a better western.
