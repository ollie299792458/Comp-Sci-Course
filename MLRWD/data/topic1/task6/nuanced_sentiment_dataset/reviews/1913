I am 51 and my musical tastes growing up and since were founded on Led Zeppelin. They were Gods to me and influenced every other musical genre that has appealed to me since from blues to opera. I say this only to show I am pro-zeppelin in the light of this review. I also want to assure people that I am in no way a purist, wanting to oreserve originals from re-interpretation or re-working, as I welcome new versions of classics.
Firstly this is not a concert as such. About a third of the songs are presented in pseudo-MTV style "on location" videos which are less than convincing visually and pretty bad musically, utterly destroying as they do some great LZ songs such as No Quarter, Nobody's Fault But Mine and When The Levee Breaks.
The Moroccan excerpts are actually pretty good musically, but are shot in outdoor locations like pop videos.
Of the rest there are pretty good versions of acoustic-style classics like Gallows Pole, What Is and What Should never Be, Battle of Evermore and Rain Song.
My all time ever favorite LZ song is Since I've Been Loving You and the version here is awful, as is Kashmir, the other major live studio offering. There a couple of other passably good acoustic renditions - Friends, That's the Way, but all in all this is a very disappointing DVD, especially as Robert Plant seems in good voice and Jimmy Page is rarely anything but good.
I think the interview with JP and RP is held in the middle of a traffic island in a London street, presumably they think that's "cool".
I like Led Zep more than anyone else I've ever known so when I say this is not to be recommeded please believe me. On the other hand the 2003 live collection is as good as anything you are ever likely to see:- Buy that and really see a great band at work. :)
