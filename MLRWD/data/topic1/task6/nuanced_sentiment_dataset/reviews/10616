The review of this DVD on this site by the person from India makes no sense. I was fortunate to see this performance live at the Paris Opera Ballet. It was performed by the Bolshoi Ballet's main company and Grigorovich supervised the final stage rehearsals. Carlos Acosta appeared as a guest artist and was coached in Paris by Mikhail Lavrovsky, one of the great interpreters of the role. Acosta and Nina Kaptsova were SUPERB - their performances are different from - but equal to - those of Lavrovsky & Bessmertnova and Vasiliev and Maximova. Acosta was stunning in his intensity and power.  He was incredibly  expressive. Unfortunately, he was dancing with a foot injury and so this performance is likely not his best technically. But that does not matter. Buy this DVD if you want to see a great interpretation of one of the few great roles for male ballet dancers. (The dancers who portray Crassus and Aegina are dreadful compared to others who have danced these roles. You can fast forward through their sections.)
