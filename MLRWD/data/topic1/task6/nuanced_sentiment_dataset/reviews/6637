I Like Jennifer Lopez aisde from her movie "The Cell"...In "Enough" Lopez meets her future husband  (Campbell) at the cofee shop that she works at.  She soon gets married and becomes a happy house wife and a parent of a young girl. But is that a happy ever after story? Noooo Campbell's character soon gets abusive  and threatens Lopez if she contemplates leaving him and especially leaving w/ their child.  The relationship immediately gets strained and Lopez wants out now and for her daughter....What can a house wife do?  Her in-laws helps  & gets her out  of the house but Campbell is soon on her tail but she quickly runs before Campbell can even get his hands on her or their daughter.  Lopez goes in hiding fearing for her life but Campbell resorts to devious ways to flush her out.  Any family connections, involving the police and searching thru any paper trail Lopez unknowingly leaves behind.  Lopez, is not safe where ever she goes and she must devise a wicked plan to trump Campbell to save her self and her daughter.  The movie also stars Juliette Lewis who I dont care for much but she was pretty good as the best friend of Lopez.
