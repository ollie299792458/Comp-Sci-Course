This movie was excellent. I have a degree in public health so this was a smash hit to me. You can gain appreciation for it on many levels.

I found the investigating of HIV and the disease course tracking to be interesting. Anyone interested in politics or history would love this movie. Anyone who has been touched by AIDS/HIV themselves or in knowing someone who suffered from the disease will gain knowledge and insight from this. Anyone who is interested in government scandals or foreign relations would be drawn to the story. And mostly, anyone who can appreciate human interaction and flaws and how our sexuality is tied or not tied to our identity would glean a lot from this.

The message and information is so powerful. Of course as anything delivered from Hollywood there are slight exaggerations to the story but for the most part it accurately chronicles the struggles both politically and scientifically that plagued the on-set on AIDS/HIV disease spread. The same frustrations can speak for many issues and so this is not only a piece dealing with the hard topic of AIDS but, since science doesnt often make it into Hollywood, it is representative of many struggles.

Matthew Modine and Lily Tomlin are wonderful!
