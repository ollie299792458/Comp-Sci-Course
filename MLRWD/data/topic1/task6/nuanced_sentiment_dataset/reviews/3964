(NOTE)-This is NOT the restored version I am reviewing, although I would love to see that in the near future.

Overall, I really enjoyed this film. It's a good old fashioned, leave-your brains at the door and enjoy it tale (tail?) of delicious malarkey. A mad professor in England goes on a search for dinosaurs to complete the work of a deceased colleague. They bring a brontasaurus back to London and WATCH OUT!

Lovers of the original KING KONG (they has special effex pioneer Willis O'Brien and stop motion wild creatures on the loose in common) and old fashioned adventure films in general will get a big hoot out of the dino fights and the brontosaurus on the rampage in London. Oh, what FUN!

Unfortuantely, I saw the trimmed 63 minute version which leaves plot elements unclear and leaves the viewer wanting more of the dinos in action. Lon Chaney would have been excellent as the mad professor (a staple of old-time science fiction corn), although Wallace Beery is pretty good here. However, the white servant in blackface and his grossly stereotyped dialogue left a nasty taste in my mouth, so I had to FF him on my remote control.

In either case, this whets one's appetitie for restored version. Enjoy.
