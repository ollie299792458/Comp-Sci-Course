Based on the Amityville Horror novel, the movie attempts to do a more liberal take on it.

What I mean by this was that many things were changed. For one thing, the George in the movie didn't seemed nearly as worry about his debts as he was stressed by it. This took away the anxiety feelings of the novel. Also different is the particular way he acted. In the novel, he was really dependent on his priest to help him and frequently called him to update his status. In the movie, I see the priest a few times, but wasn't too sure of what he was there for as he didn't seem to be too connected with George.

Not much else about the movie's differences from the book bothered me, except for one other thing, Jodie. In the book, I thought the character of Jodie was done beautifully. The novel really made him seem like a sinister force and always kept me trying to think up what he might look like. The movie, on the other hand, bored me. Jodie had maybe one good scene and the other scenes confused me more than anything.

The ending in the novel was also much more sinister than the cliche "total chaos" ending in the movie, but the movie's ending was not that bad. Overall, the movie is okay, nothing special. I sure wish George had some emotions, though. A few times in the movie, I could swear that he was really one of Jim Henson's muppets as he never shows any emotions.
