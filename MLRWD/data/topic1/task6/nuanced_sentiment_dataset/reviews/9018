I recently heard someone say they were disappointed with Gilliam's "update" of the Famous Brothers and their Fables. Whoever said that doesn't understand Gilliam's modus operandi. He is a genius at creating brand new worlds(Time Bandits and Brazil) and Bringing old Folktales and fantasy stories back to their roots while still making them entertaining(Baron Munchausen).

  The same is true of the Brothers Grimm. He offers a unique spin on Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, and quite distinctly the Gingerbead Man, but at the same time retains the essence of the original stories. Fariy Tales are DARK! They were meant to frighten Children into BEHAVING!

  I also appreciated the emphasis on Character. With the Exception of Peter Stormare's hammy torturer, the Cast is Excellent. Matt Damon is always good, but Heath Ledger Steals the film with his portrayal of Jacob Grimm. And of course Jonathan Pryce is always enjoyable.

  My biggest complaint though is a rather nasty scene involving a kitten. Gilliam can at times have an extremely nasty sense of humor and this was particularly unpleasant.

  Gilliam's films are not for all tastes I confess. But I thouroughly enjoyed this film. I'll never look at the gingerbread man the same way again.
