This movie isn't horrible. It's just such an unbelievably watered down, sterile carbon copy of the original that it really has no true soul, good or bad. If this 'remake' decided to go in a different direction, but failed, I would at least give it some credit for trying something new. Not the case here, as this movie tries to duplicate every detail, but ultimately comes up short in every aspect. It's the cinematic equivalent of karaoke.
There are too many flaws in this movie to name, but the biggest discrepancy (at least for me) was the difference between Bridget and the original chick. The original actress had the sexiness, pizazz, and athleticism to carry the character; she was believable (as well as unbelievable!!) It would take the largest suspension-of-disbelief quotient known to man to think Bridget Fonda could actually kick somebody's butt or perform any of the stunts in the movie.
If you have any self-respect as a movie-person, get the original. The subtitles actually are pretty meager, so don't worry. If you are too lazy to read subtitles, I suggest typing  "Barney and Friends" into Amazon's search engine.
