The first Universal Soldier is, and has always been one of my favorite action movies of all time.  And although this one has many differences from its original, it did not dissapoint an avid fan like me.  For a direct to video feature, I was very impressed with the overall look, and feel of the movie.  If you're looking for action, you will very happy with this one.  The fights have been updated.  Gone are the slow motion roundhouses, and somewhat predictable Van Damme fight scenes.  The battles are quick, realistic, and very violent (thumbs up).
But I should say, for fans of the original like myself hoping to see a continuing story will be dissapointed.  There is no mention, or connection to the events of the first US, other than Lundgren, and his time is short lived. Whitch is a shame because he was an awesome villian in the first.  Add to that, the ending is very open ended, and you are left with no closure on Van Damme's character of Luc.  However, if that means another sequel, I won't complain.  Van Damme's still got it!
