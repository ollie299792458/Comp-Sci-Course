Begining with the very first title, my grand daughter and I have looked forward to each and every Barbie movie, anxiously awaiting the date it would become available.  A Fairy Secret is our first disappointment!

The previous movie had a 'hint' of lost quality, but this one went off the charts for 'bad'.  The sound was almost 'tinny'.  the voices were weak, and WHAT HAPPENED to KELLY (Barbie)?  I assume the reason for changing Barbie's face was to let the audience know that YOU admitted there was someone different behind her.  Her face was gaunt....she looked flat with no dimension to her...none of the characters had any visual depth.

Unless things not only improve, but RETURN to the original quality, we will not be purchasing any more Barbie movies.  I cannot express myself strongly enough to convey my huge disappointment in this movie.

In order to keep this opinion from overrunning the page (if that is possible), I won't even TOUCH the subject of content.  The message was "materialism".
Are there new writers in addition to new voices?
