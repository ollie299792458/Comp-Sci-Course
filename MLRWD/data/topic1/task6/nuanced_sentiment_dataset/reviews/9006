First of all, I loved the first Iron Man.  It ranks as my favorite superhero movie of all time behind Batman.  However, unlike the re-envisioned Batman franchise, the sequel in this case does not transcend the original.

One of the best parts of the original Iron Man was just how hilariously "badass" Tony Stark was.  He knew he was a champ, and basically used his superior intellect and wit to overpower all of his opponents.  This doesn't carry through to this flick.  For most of the film, his usual eccentric behavior is marred by his obvious fear of death.  Knowing that he's dying, he foolish engages in random idiotic behavior until eventually the viewer is forced to say, "Grow the hell up bro!"  However, this movie is far from bad.  It still retains enough of its original charm to make it an enjoyable movie experience.  In addition, I loved Mickey Rourke's acting.  I've never heard of him before, but I'll be watching out for any future movies with him in it.  Fantastic job.

And on an off note, I didn't realize how dumb some of the plot elements in this movie are until a friend linked me a hilarious review about it on a random website.  I didn't really think about it while I was watching the film, but after I read this article I realized how ridonkulous it was for a "genius" to try to kill THE IRON MAN with an electric whip.  Not sure if linkings allowed but it's relevant so I'll add it anyway.  [...].  If anything, I enjoyed the movie even more because I started noticing all the hilarious stuff I'd missed before :D.

Overall, I'd give the film a 4/5.  The only thing I resented was the fact that Tony dropped about five notches on the "beast" scale.
