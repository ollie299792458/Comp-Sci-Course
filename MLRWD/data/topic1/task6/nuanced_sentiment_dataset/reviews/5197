****Warning this contains storylines form the book do not read if you dont want to know the differences*****

First off I liked the movie the first time I saw it, it was visually stimulating and had a plot that went smoothly. With that said, I understand they took liberties with the screenplay cause they can't include everthing from the book. But, how do you change characters that are pivotal to the story line. How do you make a charcter that Dan Brown spent so long describing and develpoing totally disappear from the movie. Let me explain:

-They deleted Maxamillion Kohler the founder of CERN intirely form the movie, he is the person to discover the journals and expose the Camerlengo for who he was.
-How do you make Vitoria discover the body when Kohler was the one to discover the body in the book?
-How do you make her father become just a business partner?
-Then they changed how Langdon was informed of the situation.
-Next they changed the name of the great elector from Mortati.
-How do you change the Hassassin's motives and thoughts to just a man hired for money.
-They made Cardinal Braggia live, when no prefertiti survived.
-The omitted Gunther Click and his entire role in reporting the events to the world, captivating everyone including the poetic speech given inside the Sistine Chapel by the Carlomengo.
-The incorprated some father in the story to die with Rocher, when in the book it was Kohler and Rocher killed in the Pope's office.
-They changed the brand from the illuminati diamond, which is one of the biggest myths in the story to the sign of the Palpacy.
-They changed the Carmalengo's name to Patrick they called him Carlo in the book (that might have just been a reference to Carlomengo).
-They omitted the entire struggle between the Hassassin and Langdon at the Illuminati Church.
-The removed the fact that Langdon was with Carlo in the Helicopter and that he actually was left for dead by Carlo with the antimatter.
-They omitted the story about how the Pope was Carlo's actual father and how that drove Carlo over the edge which caused him to set himself on fire inside the Vatican rather than outside infront of the world.
-They entirely deleted the undercurrents of attraction between Vittoria and Langdon.
-Then as a last kick in the a** they change the entire ending including the gift given by the new Pope.

Now some of these changes I can understand and agree with but certain things have to be included and shouldn't of been f***ed with. As anvid movie watcher and owning close to the neighborhood of 1,000 movies, I am totally shocked that Ron Howard would put this together. Did he really bother reading the book at all, cause if he did he would of incorporated more of the book. I mean look at Harry Potter, they split the last novel into two movies to tell it in vivid detail. Why couldn't they of done this to a superb book so the movie would of been more accurate. Some questions will never be answered, but they should of been more true to the book. My last suggestion is that if you loved the movie don't read the book, or you will not like the movie and its shortcommings campared the to discription used in the book.
