Before watching this movie, I had read reviews from several sources saying that On Her Majesty's Secret Service was one of the worst Bond movies ever. I decided to watch it anyway because I thought that if I could enjoy the truly bad Bond movies like Moonraker or Die Another Day, then I would probably enjoy this one. Not only did I enjoy OHMSS, but this could definitely be one of the top 3 or 4 Bond movies ever! But saying that, let me also say that George Lazenby was the worst Bond ever in this movie. Even with that, its amazing how good this movie still was! I could see that people don't like this movie because they don't like George Lazenby but it's unfair to just judge the movie based on the guy who played 007 in that movie. You have to look at ALL of the characteristics of the movie and overall this is definitely one of the best ALL-AROUND Bond movies ever. Diana Rigg was also probably the best Bond girl ever in this movie. This movie also has the most emotional and most moving ending to a Bond movie EVER. The ending is definitely not what you see at the end of the average Bond movie-the movie itself is definitely not the average Bond movie either. Please for the love of god, if you are a Bond fan and are holding out on watching this movie just because of its negative reviews (like I did), you are truly depriving yourself! I admit that theres not a lot of movies that I like when I watch them the first time around, but On Her Majesty's Secret Service is DEFINITELY not in that category!
