Mackenna's Gold seemingly has it all; an outstanding cast, magnificent scenery, breath-taking action and a haunting soundtrack.  Unfortunately, the plot is so convoluted it makes a pretzel look like a straight  line.
Gregory Peck and Omar Shariff are the headliners, as their personal  battle provides the major subplot to the search for a valley of gold called  "The Lost Adams."  They are almost too ably assisted by a stellar  supporting cast including Telly Savalas, Richard Kiel and Julie  Newmar.
The basic plot is typical of many westerns; disparate characters  setting aside their differences to search for riches.  However, there are  so many characters, so many sub-plots and so many twists, turns, and  double-crosses that a moment's inattention can cause the viewer to lose  track of what is happening.  This can be a very enjoyable film to watch,  but it does require some effort on the part of the audience.
The movie is  very violent and contains a good deal of adult content.  Parents are  cautioned to take a good look before letting younger children  watch.
Mackenna's Gold may be a bit too long, too complicated and too  violent, but it successfully provides a mature variation on the classic  horse opera and will be a welcome change of pace for fans of the genre.
