"The Curse of the Golden Flower" while offering striking scenes of epic proportion akin to any multi-million dollar venture offers little more than conspicuous consumption. There are dramatic scenes illuminated in gold, flowers and such...seemingly like an olympic prelude. This movie lacks sufficient character development, such as Yimou's other ventures such as "the road home," "hero" "house of flying daggers" "raise the red lantern" and "to live." Those movies captivating in both cinematography, character and emotion. It strikes a chord in the soul upon watching these films. However, I was highly disappointed in this venture because the characters were not drawn out. Gong Li's character, Chow Yun's character and such were not really full people that I cared about. Jay Chou's character is probably the most believable, however none of the plot seems to amount to much even with all the shimmering glam and low cut europeanized outfits the women wear. It does not appear to even be the Tang Dynasty, the culturally rich dynasty in Chinese history. The costuming, including the armor looks alien, appearing to be more Victorian era than Tang Dynasty and detracts from the film. Though it was effective in highlighting the extent of corruption, it fell so far short of Zhang Yimou's ability. I felt as if that hour and 45 minutes lay wasted before me in the strange decadence of the film. There is no particular dialoug or scene that sticks out in my conscious and I was not moved by any aspect of this vastly empty film. Maybe I expect to much from such a brilliant filmmaker and writer, but I cannot understand why such a film was even made, why so much money was wasted and why Zhang Yimou or Gong Li, Chow Yun Fat or Jay Chou would attach their names to such a waste of time.
