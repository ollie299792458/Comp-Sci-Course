A serious sci-fi storytelling epic complimented by wizard special effects and complex character development enters its wind down to green pastures and still waters. And Gods afoot all along.  There are some shocking events and swashbuckling twists.  And the last leap is a real zinger.

I can understand some of the complaints about this last season.  Much of the story really is slow and visits some near-soap opera realm, committed to finishing out long storylines.  But the care given to guiding this adventure to its optimistic conclusion is as well crafted as all that has come before.  Hopefully, it can happen again as various spinoffs come to Galactica fans in the future.

I loved the magnificant, clear view of the dark continent before the reunited fleet, the bold assertion of classical gods playing in human affairs, the justice for former mechanical slaves and perhaps also the epic's concluding message for our modern age to cast off the great accumulation of things (material and cultural)--and simplify, simplify.
