You've seen it all before, the mystical temple, the mystical scroll of power which must be protected by the Guardian who cannot live forever, who therefore has to elect a Chosen One, who has to fulfil the prophecy or prophecies plural, who has to demonstrate his skills and worthiness, bad guys want to steal scroll, fights, etc. East is east and west is west but ne'er the twain shall meet. Except for the bulletproof monk who is protected by the power of the scroll but strangely sees potential in a street punk pickpocket who is no great kung fu expert but has a good heart.

The chase leads over sixty years from Tibet to the US. The Nazis, who never give up, want the scroll because they are still the master race. Lots of good action for the regular kung fu movie lover, and Chow Yun Fat does act quite well. Some of the wire-work is a bit OTT tho. But the unique twist in the cocktail is the economics teaser which is delivered quite early on, in the punk's pad in the back of the cinema, and is not answered (correctly) in the film. The mystical monk has to get through to the street punk, who of course knows it all. So he asks a question that the punk can relate to. But he cannot guess the answer to `Why do hot dogs come in packages of ten, and hot dog buns come in packages of eight?' This makes it one of the few modern films to explicitly present an Economics 101 question. But the punk only has two goes and they are both wrong. I have tried this question out on various people, one of whom has some real economics qualifications, and they universally found it difficult. For the record, it took me about an hour and a half to figure it out, which is to say I got it by the end of the film. So I can at least do Econs101 and watch a film at the same time, even though I still chew gum and walk quite slowly. I am thinking of doing a little book based on lessons in economics based on great films, and this may be in there. Or maybe not. I may write my sci-fi blockbuster first.
