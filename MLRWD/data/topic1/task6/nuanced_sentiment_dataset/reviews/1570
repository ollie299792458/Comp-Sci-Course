I had high high expectations for Superman/Batman: Public Enemies when I ordered it from Amazon earlier this month. The previous Bat-film in the DC animated collection Gotham Knight was a fairly impressive series of adult-oriented vignettes. This is basically an extended Saturday morning cartoon. If that is what they were going for, why bother to include the very brief "crude comments" which warranted it receiving a pg-13 rating? It seems as if DC was hemming and hawing over whether to make it for kids or adults.

Batman and Superman's actions are often strangely homoerotic, they keep being placed into situations which require hand-holding and manly grunting. In addition, what was probably intended to be friendly banter seems like (as one reviewer already pointed out) awkward first-date conversation. The score is bland and vanilla, and the animation blocky. Perhaps I am a bit biased, as I find most Bats/Sups team-ups suck, because the Superman cast is invariably the one most utilized. Batman's rogues and allies are far more interesting, and far less lame.

On the plus side, there are a few nice touches in the fight sequences (Batman vs Lady Shiva was pretty bad-ass), the few crude comments that were in there were fairly humorous, and Power Girl looked drop-dead sexy. Not a complete waste of money to watch with your child, or if you are a diehard who collects everything Bat or Supes related. Rent it though, don't waste $15 on 67 minutes of mediocrity.

P.S. (SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The very end of the film is unintentionally hilarious as it seems like Superman is asking Batman out on a date. The Dark Knight declines, leaving Superman to make out with Lois. One can't help but think Supes is thinking of his pointy-eared companion while he lip-locks with his female sweetie.)
