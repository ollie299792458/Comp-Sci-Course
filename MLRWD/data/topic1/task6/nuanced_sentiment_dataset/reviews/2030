This DVD was beautifully shot and detailed -- the Scottish countryside is lush and lovely.  The script is a passable effort at making a complicated story palatable for modern viewers.  Richard Coyle plays the lovable John Ridd and he is a likable if not brilliant hero.  As another reviewer noted, Aidan Gillen as Carver Doone is charismatically loathsome.  The supporting cast playing the Doone clan is also excellent.

Amelia Warner as Lorna, however, is a cipher.  If she was directed to play the passionate Lorna as a stoic then she succeeded -- but to anyone who knows the story she comes off as an empty vessel.  Just awful.  Her transformation from Scottish maid to lady in waiting is completely flat -- she barely registers any emotion or ambivalence about her new status.  The Ridd family women, mother and sisters, are equally miscast and poorly acted.  I winced everytime their scenes appeared.

Hey -- but other than those considerable drawbacks this is a passable adaptation of one of the great "girls romances" of the last 300 years.  Actually, just see it for the horses.  They are all gorgeous!
