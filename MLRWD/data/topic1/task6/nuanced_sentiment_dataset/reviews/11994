I simply adore Every Which Way But Loose. It's not just one of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies ever, but it's one of my favorite movies, period. After 30 years, it's still just as fresh, funny, lighthearted and enjoyable as it first was in 1978. Clint Eastwood's character of Philo Beddoe was originally intended for Burt Reynolds by the producers who simply wanted Clint to pass the script along to Burt. I'm so glad Clint Eastwood chose the role for himself because it remains one of his best ever. Basically it's the story of the friendship between truck driver Philo Beddoe (Eastwood) and his beer-drinking pet orangutan, Clyde, and their quests to find love and make a little money on the side by bare-knuckle prizefighting. It has pretty much all you could want in a movie: two-fisted action, drama, humor, romance and even some charm to spare. The excellent supporting cast includes Sondra Locke, Geoffery Lewis, Beverly D'Angelo, Ruth Gordon, and Gregory Walcott. I first saw this one as a kid and have loved it ever since. It's one of the few movies I've seen which still entertains me as much as adult as it did when I was a child. The absolute perfect movie for a weekend get-away in the mountains or a quiet, lazy Sunday afternoon at home. A great story and it spawned an equally classic sequel, 'Any Which Way You Can' (1980). Full of lots of great one-liners and quips from Eastwood and you'll be singing along with the title song sung by country western great Eddie Rabbitt. Highly reccommended!!!!
