I absolutely loved this movie! I saw it last night with two friends of mine and we all enjoyed it. We had such a great time! I believe that, yes, this movie is not as good as the first, but it was still quite enjoyable and hilarious.

People seem to be complaining that the movies are different from the books. Well, you have to expect that when the movies are based FROM THE CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK, NOT THE STORYLINE! It just gives us a chance to see another story with our favorite characters. Even so, movies based on books can't be exactly the same as the books. It would be really boring, mostly if you read the book already. It would just be seeing the exact same thing you read acted out. Where's the fun in that? I have read all the books, and have seen both movies and I enjoy both the movies and books.

PD2 was better than what I had read on here and in the papers. People have written on here saying that they don't like the movie before it even came out! How can you say you don't like something before it is released and you haven't seen it? My advice to everyone is to see this movie, but read the books as well. Meg Cabot is truly a gifted writer, and the movies are just as good.

Hey, everyone, I'm editing this to add something new!! YAY! Some other people have complained about Mia getting married because she's 15. Umm, no, she's definitely not 15, she's 21 now and just graduated from college. I mean, HELLO, this is a DISNEY movie, do you really think they would have a teenager getting married in their movie?! No, I don't think so.
