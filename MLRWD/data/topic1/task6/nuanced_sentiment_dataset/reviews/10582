This mediocre sci-fi epic was an obvious attempt to imitate THEM! (the excellent giant ant movie of 1954), even to the extent of using similar camera angles in some scenes, and using a title that does not reveal the nature of the menace.  Unfortunately, giant grasshoppers simply do not seem as menacing as giant ants, and the special effects are very shoddy, consisting almost entirely of rear-projected real grasshoppers.  But it gets worse.  When the big attack on Chicago comes, we see several bugs crawling on a photograph of the Wrigley Building!!  Hardly convincing.  (One interesting footnote:  this is the only "giant menace" movie in which Chicago is the menaced city.)  Earlier in the film, the small town which the bugs have destroyed is represented by footage of A-bombed Hiroshima.  Apparently, giant grasshoppers eat buildings as well as people.  The awesome menace is ended when the bugs swarm en masse into Lake Michigan and drown.  (Resulting, one suspects, in an awfully messy and polluted Lake Michigan.)  Please note that this is a review of the movie itself, not the Mystery Science Theatre version.
