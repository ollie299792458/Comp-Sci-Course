I think Brando and Taylor were both awesome in this movie. The storyline is rather bold considering the sexual and social mores of those days. Of course, I really believe things were exactly the same back then, just that they were kept deep under the carpet or whatever. My eyes popped when the voluptuos and sexy Ms Taylor slowly removed all her garments and revealed all her glory (shot from the back) in a scene where her character defiantly taunted her enraged husband. She's simply fearless in this role. I didn't understand why the young captain had to ride horses bareback and in the nude (how did he get away with it?) However, I do appreciate a naked and good looking young man and I feel that the nudity helped to distract a bit from the overall moodiness and tense atmosphere. If only full frontal of men and women were allowed then! Its great that Brando's sexually closeted husband role was not turned into a creepy gay caricature otherwise it would have completely ruined the film.

Anyway, this is a good movie because of the interesting storyline and good acting from the leads. Go watch it!
