A perfectly treacherous VHS (EP - Extended Play) tape to dvd transfer.  An abject joke.

The other lone review on this page to date led me to buy this with reasonable confidence over all the other prints available.

The Color is faded to virtually non-existent.  A scratchy, grainy picture complemented only by its equally tin can sound mixing quality.  The menu is of a sound-less, low resolution, pixilated and rank amateurish design.

This edition is absolutely NOT worth the blank media upon which an otherwise intriguing cult classic was heaped and trashed.

By the only other version I have to compare, I had previously rented from Netflix their St Clair Vision edition, which is not particularly good.  On the other hand, it is far more watchable than this one - better color, much more active and zany menu with several extras, not to mention it offers a double feature ("Tormented"), along with trailers and a cartoon intermission, no less.

Beware any singularly solitary, over-hyped "5 Star" review(s) that might cost you a needless $ and do put it to more promising use elsewhere.
