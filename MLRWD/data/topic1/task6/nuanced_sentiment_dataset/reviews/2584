The Graduate of course is in my top 5 favorite films. So of course I had to upgrade to Blu-ray.

I was excited that all the reviews say that the DVD included the extras from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F798">The Graduate (40th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a>

The DVD that came with my Bluray however did not. The version that came with mine was the 2005 MGM DVD release that only includes the trailer and 4:3 (not 16:9) letter-boxed version of the film. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00079Z9VO">The Graduate</a>

It seems Fox is just throwing in whatever DVD copies they have on hand so while some people are getting the 40th Anniversary DVD not all copies include that version.

Admittedly the packaging doesn't say that any of the DVDs extras are included but it's still disappointing when you read in reviews that they are included only to find that they are not in the copy you get. It's a weak move on Fox's part to include the DVD with extras in some copies and not in others.

I contacted Fox about this and they aren't willing to do anything about it.

So buyer beware NOT ALL COPIES INCLUDE THE DVD EXTRAS and there is no way to tell whether or not it does without opening it.
