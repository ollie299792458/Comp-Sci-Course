I really wanted to like Starhunter. The premise is interesting and the universe is original, but it just doesn't live up to it's potential. The budget was obviously lacking. Sets are generally small and uninspired, the CGI work is marginal, and the special effects distract from rather than enhance the story.

Worse than that is the lackluster acting. The intro snippets by the crew's bounty hunter agent are clever, but the only real cast members that draw you in are Percy and (with less consistency) Dante.

The real trouble with the show is that despite a fairly original premise and a bold real-space setting, it just comes out as a Firefly wanna-be. As if regular plot and aesthetic similarities weren't enough, the composition of the ensemble reflects Joss Whedon's masterpiece pound-for-pound (Mal=Dante, Kalee=Percy, Zoe=Luc). Unfortunately it is a poor substitute for more Serenity.

The only reason that I even made it past the second episode was an irresistible infatuation with Tanya Allen. Unless you're already caught on her endearing warmth and charm, just go watch Firefly again instead.
