Ms Lopez has finally done something in her favour once again. After the slightly lackluster performance of 'This is Me...Then' it is good to know she can recover from her slight career dips and pack a punch as hard as the next female singer. While she is no Christina or Mariah voice-wise, I can safely say she has picked up many tips from her acting and films and mastered the art of music videos to a tee. Instead of just making the same kind of party music videos over and over again she varies each song and its theme well, and chooses a suitable style of video for each song. Her DVD videos in this vary from the electronic internet themed 'Play' and 'If You Had My Love' to the more classy 'Ain't It Funny' , and the more Bronx orientated 'I'm Real (Remix)', 'All I Have', and 'I'm Gonna Be Alright'. The only downside to this I suppose is the contradicting 'Jenny From The Block' which is probably her weakest song/video, but one she can be forgiven for.
Jennifer Lopez is not as down & out as some people may think and this DVD proves it. A classy, clever collection of her hits, proving that in the age of Beyonce and the Butt Dance she can still hold her own well.
