Wonderful film that I believe was the first to addressed the Anti-Semitic feelings that were present in this country only a few years after WWII and the world's knowledge of the Nazi's death camps.

All the principles in cast are very good and convincing. However John Garfield (a real Jew) gives a beautiful quiet, yet powerful and moving performance. The audience can see through his character what a Jew must deal with in a country that sometimes doesn't seem to want him or his "kind." You feel his pain, frustration and anger especially when he relates how his own children have been "wounded" by the ignorance and prejudice of the so called "nice people."

Miss Celeste Holm won an Oscar for her performance in the film and rightfully so. She is just marvelous in her role. The film also won an Oscar for best picture and a best director Oscar for Kazan.

I would suggest that this film be shown to high school students to help them understand how important religious tolerance and acceptance of others not "like you" really is.

We all should understand that everyone has the "right" to believe what they believe. Christians in particular should understand and I believe should have a special love for our Jewish brothers and sisters. After all wasn't our Lord and Savior a Jew?

I love film and would highly recommend it.

Thank you.
