This story is unfortunately enacting all the rumors of Arthur Rimbaud (pronouced Ram Bo) that were generated after his death by those who wished to enbrace his style but were uncomfortable with the truth of the poet himself.  Arthur was a homosexual and never formed any relationship with a woman, nor did he convert at the end.  His final parting with Verlaine (Ver lan) was not so smooth because witness who say Verlaine leave the woods that day said that he was bruised and sullen.  Likewise there is precious little poetry here. Devestating to any Rimbaud fan with high hopes.  But as a film it is quite good, though more graphic than the average movie goer might like. The acting is great, the techincal aspect above reproach.  Leo fans should note that Leo has said on a number of occations that this is the film he's proudest of.  Basically the story is a boy poet is invited to Paris by a poet of lesser talent but greater renoun. But the boy is such a care free rebel that his 19th century hosts can not stand more than one night of him before he is cast out into the rain.  But the older poet will not turn away and ends up destroying his life in pursuit of the boy.  The two travel together driving each other nuts until they part violently, with Rimbaud ending up in a hostital and Verlaine ending up in jail.  It's pretty cool.
