There are some memorable scenes in the film, most notably the urban combat scenes wherein a town is actually destroyed.  However it was too contrived for me to fully enjoy it.

Let's take the first thirty minutes of the film as example of it's failings.  I'll focus on our American Hero.  Opens with aerial shots of a fine battle, ruined for by sped up footage and comically hyper camera movements.  After establishing the characters and recieving orders to go to battle, Hartman pulls the bolt on a MG, dry-fires it at the half track gunner.  He's insane!  This is over the top.  I wouldn't trust a private soldier who did that, and certainly not a Lieutenant.

CO drives forward to be shot by a Panzerfaust. Hartman grimaces, and orders half track left, into a field, men foolishly continuing to ride inside!  Inexplicably, Jerry doesn't fire!  Hartman goes forward In a German vehicle, (making the exact same mistake his CO did a second earlier!) and amazingly TWO Panzerfausts miss him.  Heroically shouts "Get in closer!", and throws a grenade limply, a complete miss.  It explodes close to the car as it drives up to the house, to NO ill effect!  Hartman hops out, unphased, and clears the building from one side, while the M3 half-track rams a gate, and mows down the panicked Germans on the other side..

Let's face it!  The Germans would have been alerted by their comrade at the window, and shot those coming from the left! This is typical. I would never take such orders from someone so careless. These veterans are farcical constructions, and it works as long as nobody questions it.

Other oddities include: In many panning shots, lens seriously distorts the image. Jump shots. Unnatural lights.  if not three way light, dark with bright lights in wrong places. No medium, heavy tanks, tank destroyers, SP guns!  For the number of vehicles there's a lack of infantry, and finally "Angel" is the 'Jar Jar Binks' of this film.
