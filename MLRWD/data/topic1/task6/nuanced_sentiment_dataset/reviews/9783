Take elements from "Conan the Barbarian" and "The Scorpion King" (with equally cheesy dialogue), "Stargate" (with less convincing sets), throw in a pinch or two of "One Million Years BC" (without Raquel Welch for distraction), add some not especially well-done CGI, and you have the formula for "10,000 BC." Needless to say, if you're looking for historical (or would that be pre-historical?) accuracy or geography that makes any kind of sense, skip this one. On the other hand, if you can suspend disbelief and accept that this story takes place in some vaguely archetypal "realm of legend" you might like it, at least a little. "Spirit walking," along with the idea that primitive peoples could communicate telepathically over long distances is not new to this film, and while these concepts have been exploited to better effect elsewhere, they do seem to work in this context. Late Ice-Age monsters such as giant birds and sabre toothed cats, while exaggerated here, are not entirely invented from whole cloth. On balance, this isn't quite as bad as it might have been--unfortunately, that's not saying much.
