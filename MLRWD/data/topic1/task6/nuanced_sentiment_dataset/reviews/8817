This is one of the most bemusing movies I've seen in a long, long time. On the one hand it is a very attractive movie on an artistic level (the church itself is perhaps the star here). Yet on the other hand, plot-lines are so generously distributed in a seemingly hap-hazard fashion (often simply dissapearing never to return), that you're left wondering if a script was in use or simply some kind of Dice Man approach to story telling. And God only knows why little Asia wore a whicker basket over her head in the opening prologue.
I love Argento movies with a passion, but this is far from an Argento movie. Its Soavi's attempt at an over-ambitious theme that gets seriously lost well before the translation. This movie fails where Argento's Inferno succeeded.
I'd love to say its great, but, seriously, its just plain ok.
Anchor Bay's budget release has pretty good picture quality in general, exposing the very 'eighties' feel of the movie.
Overall? Worth seeing for the price, but not outstanding by any means.
