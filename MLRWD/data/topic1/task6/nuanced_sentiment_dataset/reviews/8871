It is quite sad that the best film about a possible nuclear holocaust is not available in region 1 format and is no longer in print. "Threads" is graphic, epic, and intimate. Graphic in its depiction of a nuclear war. You will not be able to forget its horrific images. Epic in its scope. The movie goes from first day of the attack to 13 years later. Intimate in its focus on one town in England, two families, and some local officials all of whom you really feel sympathy for. I firmly believe that this film should be required viewing for ALL the people on this planet, especially for our world leaders. But the best film about this issue is unavailable on region 1 DVD. I am lucky to have a VHS copy of "Threads" which I purchased from Shock Video. I transferred this VHS to DVDrw. With so much trash available on DVD these days, I think it behooves video companies to finally put something out there that can really change things. "Threads" can do it!!!! By the way, "Threads" makes "The Day After" look like a Sunday picnic, and it is a much better film as well.
