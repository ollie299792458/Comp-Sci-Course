I too have been a Satriani fan for years now and NOTHING compares in my opinion to the Live In San Fransisco DVD set.  That dvd is edited and produced beautifully.  Note that this review does not reflect Joe Satriani's talent and music, but rather the editing and producing of the video itself.  Virtually unwatchable is an understatement.  I was hoping to really see the man play, but got a "watch how many video effects I can add at one time one right after the other" mtv music video instead.  Extremely disappointed and hope that the Satriani team picks a different production team for the next live DVD.  I was really excited to see him play Time Machine but got clouds and water droplets instead.  If I wanted to see that I would have looked up the song on youtube.  Again, this is NOT a reflection of Satriani himself or his music, just this particular dvd's aggravating use of effects.  Satriani fans are generally musical themselves and want to see the man actually playing.  Even if they are not I'm sure they don't want an MTV style seizure trying to watch him play.  I truly hope they learn from this one and perhaps the next one will be comparable to the Live in San Fransisco DVD which is absolutely amazing as far as musician ship and capturing it's live magic.  Sorry guys, don't waste your money, just get the sound track.
