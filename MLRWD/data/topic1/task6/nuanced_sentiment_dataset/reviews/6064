The Very Muppet Christmas Movie suffers from "trying too hard" syndrome. It's as though they tried to make this movie "current", instead of just letting it be charming because it's the Muppets.

Some of it works:
* It has some nice star cameos that are well integrated with the Muppets.
* Some of the little physical jokes are classic Muppets.

But a lot of it doesn't work...
* Dave Goelz and Frank Oz didn't do their original voices, so a vast majority of the characters have different voices. Kids won't notice this, but adults and fans of the original Muppets will find this pretty distracting.
* Some of the humor tries to be "modern"... jokes about strip clubs, a male character turning everything a female character says into sexual innuendo, a Muppet shrimp that jokes about "how I like my women", Scooter working as a cage dancer in a nightclub, etc.  My kids and I watch the Simpsons, so I'm no angel, but these jokes feel really odd here.
* Too many "current" jokes, like Bunson Honeydew working on "Windows", which is a grease pencil on a glass window.

So if you're looking for the next Muppet Family Christmas (sadly out of print on DVD and going for $100+ on Amazon) or Muppet Christmas Carol (a classic), you will be very, very disappointed.

This is a better one to catch on TV than to buy...
