I am a HUGE Star Wars fan, always have been and always will be, but when I first saw Fanboys, I had never felt more proud to be Star Wars fan. It showed me that we SW fans aren't just freaks that we're just normal people with a common interest.

Now when I first seen the trailer for the movie on the Clerks 2 DVD, I was so excited and pumped to see it. Little did I know I would have to wait years before I would get to finally see it, and then finally in May 2009 it finally came out, and I fell in love.

The movie follows the story of a group of 5 friends. 4 boys 1 girl. One of which is battling cancer and is going to die before The Phantom Menace is released. So the fanboys go on a journey to Lucasranch to steal a copy of TPM so that Linus (the one with cancer) will be able to see it before he dies. Amid all the Star Wars references and hilarity is heart touching story about friendship, and many cameos by geek gods like Billy Dee Williams, Carrie Fisher, Kevin Smith, Jason Mewes, Seth Rogen, Jaime King, William Shatner,Danny Trejo and more!

So if your a Star Wars fan I definitely think you should buy this movie.
