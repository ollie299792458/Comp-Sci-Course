As a child growing up in the 60's and 70's these old black and white sci-fi movies were on TV just enough times to keep them fun for a kid (and probably some adults in those days).  Keep in mind that the special effects were state of the art in their day.  Those giant ants that seem so mechanical and phony today were pretty scary and realistic enough for kids and adults when the movie was first released.

You could say "Them" was the "Jurrasic Park" of the 50's.

So we sat by the TV on Saturday evening watching "Creature Feature" or whatever horror show was on with our bag full of freshly popped popcorn (that means stove top with real butter) and we munched and stared, anxiously waiting to see man battle the giant ants and save the world.  The military was always "hush,hush", national security and top secret and everybody smoked cigarettes.  The funny thing is we didn't notice the cigarettes when we were kids.  Still, "Them" is as entertaining today as it was then.  Can we get a remake?

Now the "Beast From 20,000 Fathoms" wasn't as scary and the acting wasn't nearly as good (and no close ups of the monster) but it's a two for one deal so I felt I got a little extra for what I would have paid for "Them" alone!  It brings back all those fun memories and it still holds some suspense.  I'll watch "Them" again...but from now on it will be with microwave popcorn!!!
