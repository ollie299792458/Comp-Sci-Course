The movie, Kung-Fu Hustle, didn't strike me as something I would go and buy- but someone introduced me to the flick, and by the end of the first scene, I was hooked. Nothing is funnier than classic archetypes portrayed in the most animated way possible, over-the-top hyper-serious scenes that are peppered with the absurdity of the human need to be better than one's self. The characters, acted perfectly, are written to be likeable, bizarre, and even intrinsically identifiable. But the action, whether it be a gang slaughter at a police station, or a dance scene in the middle of a street, fits well with the wit of the play within the players. Had this been written as a non-comedy, I'd likely be horrified by every action- but as it is- it makes the idea of violence for violence sake a concept that only clowns and buffoons can master. Kung Fu Hustle is a film of martial arts mastery, high energy comedy, the twists of the human condition, and certainly a statement of the Haves and Have-Nots. Just a wild ride, escapism in its truest form.
