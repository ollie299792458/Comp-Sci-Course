Oliver Stone has a serious threat (SERIOUS THREAT) to his title as Most Heavy Handed Director working in Hollywood (HOLLYWOOD) (SHOW MAP OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH A RED STAR WHERE HOLLYWOOD IS - CUT TO PICTURE OF "HOLLYWOOD" SIGN) today and his name is TONY SCOTT! (HIS NAME IS TONY SCOTT).

Where do I start? Well, I saw "Man On Fire" (CUE "MAN ON FIRE" MONTAGE) and knew what he was capable of (CAPABLE OF) but was drawn to this movie because the screenplay was written by the man that brought the world "Donnie Darko". (SHOW PICTURE OF RICHARD KELLY TYPING AWAY FURIOUSLY). And truth be told, the story is the only thing that saved this movie because without that, I would have walked out after 15 minutes. (SHOW MAN GETTING UP ANGRILY FROM THEATRE SEAT)

Not content to simply "DIRECT" anymore, Tony Scott feels the need to employ all manner of iritating gimmicks that honestly detract (DETRACT) from the film in many ways. Do we need whacked out camera angles, fast cuts, unneeded subtitles, redundant graphics or anything else that takes away from the story? This would be a much better picture without his big, greasy "Look at me, I'm TONY SCOTT" handprints all over it.

Despite all these obstacles, "Domino" succeeds on the basis of story alone... I will spare you the plot summary, just go watch. One word of advice (ADVICE) - pick a seat well back from the screen or you will get sick (SHOW MAN PUKING) not that the violence is extreme but the editing and alternating dark and light shots will surely nauseate you. OH! And if the way I wrote this (WROTE THIS) bothers you, then get ready to be irritated beyond belief because the film is filled with junk like this. (JUNK LIKE THIS)

Three out of five stars on story alone (STORY ALONE) (SHOW PICTURE OF SOLAR SYSTEM WITH THREE STARS SHINING BRIGHTLY)
