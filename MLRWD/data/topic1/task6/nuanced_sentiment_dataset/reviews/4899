The Omega Man is one of the better 'Bleak View of the Future with Lots of Concrete' films to come out of 1970s. Chuck Heston plays Robert Neville, a survivor of a biological weapon unleashed during the Third World War that turns a percentage of the world's population into diseased, nocturnal albinos. A scientist, specifically in the realm of organic chemistry, Neville is less interested in finding a cure as he is in eradicating the vampire like Luddites (Anti Progress/Mechanization) that have targeted Neville as the symbol of the evil that has reduced them to their present state. Holed up in his Manhatten fortress Neville conducts his dual program: a daytime regime of albino extermination followed by a nighttime siege by the selfsame enemy. The audience gets to enjoy the  eccentricities of a protagonist that is truly alone in the face of an implacable and inhuman foe. Then everything changes....

This film does suffer a bit from the age in which it was made. File footage of atomic explosions and missile launches place it solidly in the age before seamless computer graphic effects.  The albino victims of the plague have a 'Black-xploitation'  70s feel to them as does another aspect of the film...that I will not touch upon for fear of spoilers. That said, the Luddite aspect is handled very well. It has a nice self destructive and believable feel to it. Also, there are gorgeous long shots of Empty New York (tm). Everyone is out to get everyone else; scientist and monsters alike. The world really has gone mad: science and anti-science face off in the ruins of civilization.
