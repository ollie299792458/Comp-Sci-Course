All the mastery of the animated series of "Batman", "Superman", and "Batman Beyond" has been brought to life in this latest DC animated incarnation: "Justice League". The superior fusion of writing and animation, of action and character, of fanboy-pleasing and newcomer sensitivity remain as good as ever. One would not even suspect the creators' initial apprehension of approaching such a grand project as representing a whole team of classic heroes for a new audience of potential fans (as well as those who were raised on the "SuperFriends").
With such praise and self-evident merit, it is disappointing that Warner Bros. would opt to employ their traditional, minimalistic philosophy in the DVD format. The "special" features are NOT, the "languages" are in fact singular, and only the pilot episode is presented, as compared to the earlier DVD release <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000399WG">Batman Beyond - The Movie</a>, which included four (4) other episodes from the first season besides the pilot.
Bottom line: I hope that something better comes along.
