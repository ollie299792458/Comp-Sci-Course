As a huge fan of the American Pie series, I desperately wanted another movie featuring the main cast because I thought American Wedding just wasn't good enough. It made jokes that weren't funny and a large chunk of screen time was devoted to Stifler (not a terrible thing, but the scenes were garbage) with just lame material. And of course a lot of the principle cast was absent.

I saw a couple of the Pie spinoffs, but it was clear that many of us wouldn't view those movies as canon to the REAL series. When American Reunion was announced I thought it would be the prefect opportunity to wrap the series in a way the "Wedding" should have.

After buying the Blu-Ray and watching this one, I loved every single second of it! It felt like watching Pie 1 and 2 again and the characters felt real again, not like in "Wedding" where it felt like they were there for the paycheck.

Seeing all the main members of the cast back is a real treat for die-hard fans of the 1st movie and seeing cameos from the Sherminator, Nadia, the MILF guys and so on really added to a fun ride. My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is I wish they would've given more screen time to Jessica (Natasha Lyonne). Vicky and Jess were real good friends so it would've made sense to have those two actually interact in the film. They kinda do in a deleted scene, but honestly it's a minor quibble.

The guys actually develop in this film and Stifler is as likable in this film as he's ever been and it's nice to see him finally acknowledged as part of the gang and the story for Jim's Dad is fresh and hilarious too.

I highly recommend this film, plot points from the previous films are recognized and mentioned and weaved into this film perfectly and I think it pays a great tribute to the series to end with this one.
