Yes, this film is a bit formulaic, but it's still a somewhat entertaining movie.  Angelina Jolie does a great job as the police officer forced to collect forensics evidence from the serial killer's crime scenes.  These  scenes are rather suspenseful, but not as gory as other reviewers may have  you believe.  Or perhaps the movies have just desensitized me to gore!  :-)  I really like the tension the film builds by recurring the situation of  "We've almost figured the killer out, but can we save the victim in  time?"  An additional bonus of the movie:  Queen Latifah as the kind,  yet tough caretaker.  I can't think of anyone better suited to play this  role.
This movie is not without its flaws, however.  First, I just didn't  buy the romantic subplot between Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie.  My  biggest qualm with the film, though, is the ending.  It simply felt tacked  on.  The fun of a movie like "Scream" is that the audience is  constantly kept guessing as to who the killer is, and at the end, we find  out who guessed right and who guessed wrong.  In this movie, however, we  don't get to have that fun.  We're forced to sit on the sidelines and let  the director be the only active participant.  When we learn who the killer  is, you'll be left with the feeling of "Umm, OK, if you say so."  If you're expecting subtle clues throughout the movie to tip you off,  you'll be sorely disappointed.  We only learn of the killer's motives  through his oh-so-lengthy monologue at the film's climax (in typical  Hollywood fashion).
Most of the film is fun, although there's really  nothing here that you haven't already seen in other suspense/horror films.  The biggest drawback is the ending that just peeters out.  If you can  overlook the ending and enjoy everything preceeding it, you may want to  check this out.  To be safe, though, rent before you buy.
