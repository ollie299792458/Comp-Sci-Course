This is a lovely movie, Cate Blanchet's performance as the title character is excellent, as is the rest of the cast. The costumes are spectacular.
  As others have noted, this film is entertainment, not history.  The writer(s) mixed fact with pure fancy, and compressed many authentic episodes that occured over 40 or so years into the beginning of the reign.  Walsingham did not kill Marie de Guise, nor did he oust Cecil as Elizabeth's primary advisor.  Robert Dudley was not involved in any murder plot.  I won't bore you with the rest of the laundry list.
  I think it only fair to point out that in my opinion, despite the inaccuracies, the writer(s) did manage to give a fairly accurate view of some major aspects of Elizabeth I's entire reign.  She did use possible marriage as a political tool.  And she was damned adept at doing so.  Elizabeth did have a more moderate religious policy than either of her two predecessors.
The movie is worth watching.  And, if seeing it whets your curiosity, read any of the several popular level biographies of
Elizabeth I. Alison Weir's _The Life of Elizabeth I_ is very well written.
