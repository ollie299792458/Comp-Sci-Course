What can I say that has not already been written?  Spoiler alert!!!The characters are dead either because they died in the plane crash in season one or in season 6.  The writers/producers of Lost played a long con on the audience.  They created mystery after mystery to maintain ratings, but they never had intention of resolving the mysteries.  If they had wanted to resolve the mysteries. they would have written the solution to the mystery at the same time as they introduced the mystery into the plot.  What murder mystery ends without the murderer being known?

But even if you completely disagree with my viewpoint and liked the show including season 6, wait to buy season 6.  Prices goes down not up.  On September 12, Lost was at #31 in 19 days of release.  Two days later on September 14, Amazon ran a one day in which you could purchase season for around 425.

Thus I would advise you to wait for the after Christmas sale to buy this disk.  Also you could try out Ebay for better prices on season 6.

I do not think you should buy season 6.  but if you do, but it at the lowest possible price.
