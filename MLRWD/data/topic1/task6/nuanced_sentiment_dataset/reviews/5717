I found this movie disturbing as it much resembles a horrible home invasion which happened in this country only a few weeks ago, in which a family was brutalized by two upper class young men, and only one family member survived. I had wondered what it must feel like to be a victim of something like that, and this movie made the situation clearer to me. I understand that it is going to be remade in the US. The remake will probably be seen by more Americans than the foreign-language original. If it does any good, it will warn people that this can really happen, and maybe to be a little more cautious.

That said, elements of the film seemed rather implausible. The sadists apparently had murdered another family just before they came to these people's "cabin" (actually a rather palatial mansion). Yet, the two young men had no blood on their tennis whites, and apparently were carrying no weapons!

Secondly, it is hard to believe there was only one phone in a house that size. And how did the bad guy know there weren't any more phones after he put one out of action?

Finally, when the little boy was trying to escape, he futilely tried to climb over the gate, but didn't think of crawling under it, although it looked like there was more than enough room.

These implausibilities could easily have been avoided, and somewhat spoiled the realism on which a movie like this depends to maintain the feeling of shock and horror which the director is trying to induce.
