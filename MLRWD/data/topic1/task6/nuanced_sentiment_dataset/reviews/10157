My friend once told me that if you wanna feel good and sexy try salsa. I completely agree with her now, of cos then I thot salsa wasn't my cup of tea. This dance seemed very complicated and I always had the impression that only real good dancers would be able to do salsa.

M glad I changed my mind and bought this wonderful DVD for beginners, the steps are so well defined and pictured that you would find them so easy to catch. The instructors make Salsa dancing all the more fun; they are so peppy and lively that anyone who sees them dance would be mesmerized by their moves and rhythm. You can watch the steps from all angles as they are shot in all dimensions.

There is nothing more romantic then a fast salsa dance with your sweetheart but are you up to it? If you have never tried it and you are afraid, time to shed any inhibition the ultimate guide to Salsa is here. This is a great purchase for beginners and for all those who want to learn salsa at home.

 Highly recommendable!
