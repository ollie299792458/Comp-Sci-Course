If you are interested in viewing a documentary on an intercultural experience, this is the film for you. "Short Cut to Nirvana" shows the largest gathering of humanity on earth: the Kumba Mela. Over 70 million people show up for this humongous festival that happens in India only once every twelve years. As you view the video, you get a private guided tour through this incredible journey of eternal wisdom and joy that exists at this one of its kind phenomenon. There is a yogi who goes, "Ring-a-ding-a-ding. A-ring-a-ding-a-ding-ding. I am blessing you", a Japanese woman who buries herself for three days, a dude that smears some type of stinging/healing ointment in people's eyes for ten rupees, an African spiritual master with a small saucer stuck in his lower lip, and a yogi who does something incredible with a bamboo pole and his privates (you may want to cover the children's eyes for this one). There is even a special appearance by His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. This is one video you need to see at least once in your lifetime, or maybe even twice. I am keeping one copy for myself and buying more copies for family and friends.
