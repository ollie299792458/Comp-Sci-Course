They remade Footloose?  I groaned when I even thought about how bad this was going to be.  I liked the original, and didn't even consider seeing this when it came out at the theatre.  Flash forward to a cold and rainy night, and my teenage kids decide to rent this on pay per view.  I groan again, thinking how awful this is going to be.  I couldn't even watch it, so I puttered around the house doing everything else but sit there and watch a somewhat iconic movie be destroyed.  Two hours later, and my kids could not stop talking about it.  They loved it.  Curious, I plopped down and watched it.  They wanted to see it again.  I was shocked.  The first thing that grabs your attention is how my kids kept thinking the clothes and hair were cool.  I told them that in the ancient 80's, we used to flip our collars up, have our pants cinched at the ankles, and wear our hair short on the sides and long on top.  I also told them we used to dance.  It was a blast from the past, but a bridge to the present.  The story seemed fresh to the teenagers, and was even fresh to me.  The dancing is great.  The acting is decent, and this movie is fun.  There are a few scenes that are not appropriate for younger kids (a girl having sex for the first time, drug references, underage drinking, a girl getting slapped by her boyfriend, some swearing), but very tame stuff when compared to the groundbreaking stuff John Hughes did in the 80's.  It was a way to connect with the kids.  The movie is certainly way better than expected.  Way better than the garbage some remakes are.  Well done.  Well done indeed.
