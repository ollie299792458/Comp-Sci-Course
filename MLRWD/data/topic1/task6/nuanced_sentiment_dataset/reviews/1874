This miniseries is quite possibly the worst I have ever seen set in ancient times surpassing Cleopatra that aired a couple of years ago.  The need to shoe horn Tyrranus in altered what is, on its own, a remarkable and dramatic story in its own right.

Octavius was only 18 when Julius Caesar died and he proceeded to take on all the military and political bigwigs including Mark Antony.  Octavius raised his own army, marched on Rome, forced the government to punish Caesar's assassins, appointed himself consul over 20 years before he was eligible and became sole ruler of the Roman Empire by the age of 31.  That alone should have made the basis for an interesting miniseries.

As for this one, like a previous reviewer said the producers would have done much better to focus on the political machinations rather than setting up ridiculous scenerios such as having Octavius sold as a slave.  The acting over all is good and I particularly like Michael Byrne as Cicero.  I just wish the miniseries had been worthy of his talent.  If you want to see a really good miniseries check out HBO's Rome.  Not only is plot much more historically accurate, but the producers and director have managed to recreate a city that lives and breathes in comparison to cookie cutter sets in Empire.
