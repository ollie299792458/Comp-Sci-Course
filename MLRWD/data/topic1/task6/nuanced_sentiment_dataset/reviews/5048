What a wonderful film!  Every time I revisit it, I am reminded of why I love Woody Allen films.  This one is a classic: Allen scripts the most natural relationships and dialogue (full of one liners) that intertwines classic film motifs to really entertain and engage his audiences.

This acting pair is great: Diane Keaton is to Woody Allen as Grace Kelly is to Hitchcock.  They are two comedic geniuses that truly seem to belong together (on screen that is).  Alan Alda and Anjelica Huston are tremendous as supporting characters.  They effortlessly blend with Keaton and Allen.  And even a little Zach Braff for all those Scrub fans (he has a tiny part as Allen and Keaton's son).

The plot is this: A typical NY couple meets their neighbors late one night, and the next night she is dead.  Carol for some reason, just does not believe it was from a heart attack, as they were told.  Without much to go on, except for the support and guidance of Ted, a friend who just so happens to be newly divorced and looking a little too much in Carol's direction.  Poor Larry just cannot see it, but will try to help his wife Carol in her escapades, just to save his marriage.  Double Indemnity, The Lady from Shanghai, Unfaithfully Yours, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXC7">Rear Window (Collector's Edition)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC7PPS">Vertigo (Universal Legacy Series)</a> are all utilized in the film to give this comedic story some real mystery.

It is a wonderful film that will keep you laughing and guessing.  I highly recommend it!
