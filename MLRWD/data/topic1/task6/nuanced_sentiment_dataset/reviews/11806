I caught this film while channel surfing after I'd finished "My Super Ex-Girlfriend" on Pay Per View.  After watching a few minutes I thought, these are the same characters.

If Uma Thurman's G-girl didn't have any powers in "Ex-Girlfriend" she'd be a lot like Jennifer Aniston's ferret-loving Polly Prince.  Ben Stiller plays a risk assessor for an insurance agency who's just as dorky and introverted as Luke Wilson's "Super Ex" architect.  And instead of Rainn Wilson ("The Office") as the boorish best friend dishing out bad relationship advice, "Polly" has Philip Seymore Hoffman ("Capote") as a washed-up child-star slob, egging Stiller to slap Aniston's rear during sex and ask "Who's your daddy?"  It's this exchange that sets up the film's conflict: Aniston, repulsed by the comment, boots him out of her apartment.  Stiller then has to learn to see Polly through his own eyes and prove his love before he loses her in the third act.

"Along Came Polly" is as safe, generic and cut-and-paste as a romantic comedy can be. Surprising, since director/screenwriter John Hamburg provided plenty of laughs in "Meet the Parents," and "Zoolander" was at least somewhat original, if a little stinky.  That's not to say "Polly" isn't beyond repair: there are several amusing sight gags involving Aniston's blind ferret and Stiller's indigestion; Aniston and her salsa instructor give Stiller several opportunities to make light of his inadequacies (something he's a master at).  Bryan Brown ("FX") is entertaining as Stiller's potential insuree, an Austrailian millionaire who also happens to be an extreme sports enthusiast.  And Hoffman gave me a lot of laughs when he tried to be the lead instead of Judas in the Hell's Kitchen community theater version of "Jesus Christ Superstar."

So, "Along Came Polly" is worth a shot if you catch it on TV, but ultimately forgettable.  Actually, the soundtrack is better than the movie, though it's still nothing to swoon over.
