This is a two hour indulgence in an old fashion love story plot line but with today's violence, explosives and special effects.  No thinking required.  It certainly did not hurt this movie that Brad and Angelina were embroiled on their own love story when this movie was being filmed.  There's plenty of chemistry going on.

It was great seeing the characters in their bored married state and the witty dialog of one liners throughout the movie was hilarious.  The story line was just interesting enough to keep you involved in the movie.  A more sophisticated story line would have been overkill (no pun intended).

A bit predictable.  Is there anyone who didn't know that the ultimate fight scene in the house was going to end up with them getting back together?  But that's okay because this film does not pretend to be anything else but fun.

Brad and Angelina should capitalize on their relationship and make a series of remakes of all the classic love story movies from the 40's.
