Noah Wyle [Carter from ER] plays Flynn Carsen, a nerdy intelligent librarian that gets recruited by the government to preside over the super secret underground library. This library contains all of the super secret volumes that were only rumored to exist. It also contains things like the Arc of the Covenant, Pandora's Box, Excalibur [still in the stone], The Golden Goose, etc.

Soon after Carsen is shown around the library by Judson, [Bob Newhart], the library is broken into by a crack team of evil doers. One third of the "Spear of Destiny", that was in the care of the library, is stolen. This is the spear that pierced Christ's side. This is a dangerous artifact. Hitler had a third. Napoleon had a third. Generally it's a bad thing in the wrong hands.

Someone is trying to get all three segments together. Very Bad. It's up to Carsen to gather the other parts before the villains do. The first piece is in the Amazon somewhere. While traveling to South America he meets up with Nicole Noone [Sonya Walger] who is basically his protector. Action packed silly adventure ensues.

The villain is villainous. The hero is virtuous. The heroine is competent. And Bob Newhart is the marine who kicks butt. [Go with it. It's funny]

It's not a "Raiders of the Lost Arc", it's not worth going to see in a theater. It may not even be worth buying. But if it's going to be broadcast on the box, enjoy!
