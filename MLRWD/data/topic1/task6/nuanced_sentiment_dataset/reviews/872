I was anticipating this DVD for about six months so I was very excited to have it in my hands. I actually felt like I did when I bought my first "new release" by Rush (GUP).
I watched the documentary first and was pleased. I popped in the concert and was shaking my head in disappointment within minutes.
I do not have sound issues because I don't have the equipment to make a fair assesment. I take a very BIG issue with the editing. It's all over the place, to put it simply.
There's no rhyme or reason to the pacing of the cutting other than cutting to the music.  They had fifty cameras there and they make sure you get a shot from each angle every thirty seconds. Just when you start appreciating a shot of Peart going Bonzo, they cut away. Instead of spotlighting Alex for more than three seconds from one angle, they cut to another angle and you know, there's just no reason for it. And it's like that for the whole show. Even the songs with a more moderate tempo like "Bravado" or "The Pass" were getting the same cutting treatment. Even in between songs for pete's sake.
I'm sorry but if I were watching a four minute music video of "Rush In Rio", then yes, cut away. During high energy moments like "The Spirit Of Radio", cut to your MTV heart's content. But the entire show is like this and it is exremely frustrating to watch.
The video looks great. Nice and crisp like you're watching the show through a window. I was very impressed with the band. Whoo boy! They rocked the house. So why did they go amateur with the editing? Maybe Geddy owed someone a favor so he let thier kid edit the show on their iMac.
A "must have" for fans, that's for sure. But be warned. Just when you're digging the animation going on behind the band, guess what happens. They cut away. I almost felt like the editor of the show was intentionally teasing me with three lousy seconds of Alex literally blazing over the guitar, then cutting to a shot of the stage from three hundred feet in the air.
