This is a movie maker's movie.  Alfred Hitchcock would have said this was a truly great movie.  I love all kinds of horror movies; gory horror, psychological horror, cheesy horror.  And unlike many movie watchers I know what makes a good movie having studied film in college.

The mastery with which the main story unfolds and the paranoia/terror builds in this movie is on par with Hitchcock or Kubrick.  This movie is not for the ADHD generation.  I saw one reviewer call this movie "boring".  Yeah, again if you have ADHD look elsewhere.  This is a movie that needs to be watched from start to finish without interruption.  The horror comes in the way the events of the story unfold and picturing yourself in the place of Rosemary trapped helpless in this situation unable to break free.  I recently watched The Vanishing by George Sluizer.  The Vanishing attempted the exact type of horror in Rosemary's Baby except failed quite horribly in comparison.  Sluizer should have spent more time studying Polanski, Hitchcock or Kubrick whoever it was he got his inspiration from.

If you have an attention span longer than 5 minutes (most teenagers these days can't sit still this long) and you appreciate a horror movie that gets under your skin without any gore or violence than this is the movie for you.  If you like movies that are pinnacles of writing and film making then this movie is also for you.  If you have a short attention span, low intelligence or are just looking for shock value in a movie than steer clear of this movie.  We don't need more kids with ADHD calling a great movie like this "boring".
