Aside from being perfectly cast and acted, wonderfully written, brillianty directed and insanely edited (sorry about all the superlatives)Go is a fantastic movie. Please, spare me the comparrisons to Pulp Fiction, though. While I'm not denying that there are some, I just think it is unfair to burden such an accomplished movie as Go with a "copycat" status. Not only is Go an original movie, it is, dare i say, MORE entertaining than Pulp Fiction. Where in that movie characters needed to express themselves in long, overwrought and ultimatley pretentious monologues, Go let's the characters actions speak for themselves with never a forced line or false moment which makes the movie surprisingly believeable. While that is good, a documentary on the rave scene is probably not what you are looking for. Fear not, Go is first and foremost a wildly entertaining movie that will make you jump, laugh and (at some points) have your jaw hanging near the ground. While some may argue that Go is purely "fluff" with no real plot and no real place in history as a relevant and important piece of filmmaking, I must disagree, because not only is this a fun movie, it is a very greatly made movie that deserves all the acolades it recieves. Doug Liman has crafted a movie that will, in time (if the world is fair), be viewed as a paean to what it was like to be young and desperate during the late 90's. If not, then oh well, because above all, Go is hugely entertaining. And if that is not recomendation enough, then (you knew it was coming) GO see it.
