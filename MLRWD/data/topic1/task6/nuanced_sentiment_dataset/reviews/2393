This film was a serious disappointment. In The Loop is a film-length development of the cult British TV series The Thick Of It, which features the daily travails of a hapless government minister and his aides as they spend a large amount of their time battling Malcolm Tucker, the profane and half-insane chief spokesman for the Prime Minister. The episodes are not always funny and can be tough to watch, but they're only half an hour long. This is the first big problem with In the Loop -- while you can survive a half hour dose of The Thick of It, the effect of an hour and 45 minutes is numbing. By the end of the film you're immune to the word play and streams of outrageous language and temper eruptions. You just want the film to end.

  The other major flaw to the movie starts the second the cast leaves the centre of the British government in London and moves to Washington. The makers of the film clearly have no idea how the U.S. system or officials or politician really work and so we have a bunch of characters with American accents, supposedly high up in the U.S. executive branch, acting exactly the same way the British ones do, firing off the same volleys of profanity.

  Lost in all this is the story of how some American officials are pressing for a war in an unnamed Middle Eastern country and the chaos that ensures when a clumsy and not very intelligent British minister and his press aide stumble into the action. The idea has potential but you won't find much to satisfy you in this mess of a movie.
