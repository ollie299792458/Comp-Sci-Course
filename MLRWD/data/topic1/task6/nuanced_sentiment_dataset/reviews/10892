This movie is very good, but unfortunately not perfect.  The fighting is very good in most parts, but very short in my opinion.  The ending fight scene is probably the best out of the whole movie when him and his arch-enemy Gemma duke it out (especially when Jubei headbutts him).  The whole movie is basically about the hero, Jubei, fighting a group of ninjas each with super-human powers.  When you do watch this movie, steer clear of the dub.  Its basically a clone of Wicked City with the same voice actors being re-introduced.
  Also, I've noticed that this movie also (like Wicked City) offers a fair share of female sexual abuse.  It might be because that's how it was back then, but in one scene they show one particular sex-oriented thing that probably could have been left out entirely without hurting the movie one bit (the scene where the shadow ninja captures Kigero).
  Otherwise, this movie was a delight to watch, but its not near worth the hype that surrounds it.  I would still reccomend the DVD to true fans of the Anime and ninja type shows.
NOTE:  This movie features a ninja named Jubei but has nothing to do with another show that is very similar to it called Ninja Resurrection.  Both shows have ninjas as the base of attraction and a hero named Jubei, but neither have anything to do with each other.  Two different companies, two different shows.
