After the bad reviews deservedly garnered by "Ryan's Daughter" Mr. Lean decided to take his ball and go home for 15 years.  We can only speculate on what great movies could have been made during that time (such as Mr. Eastwood has been doing in his old age).  Luckily for us, though, he decided to come back for one last film, "A Passage to India", before he passed away in 1991.  The trouble with greatness, however, is that once you achieve it, it's always expected.  And there's no doubt Mr. Lean achieved it three times in a row with "The Bridge on the River Kwai", "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Dr. Zhivago", and previously with "Brief Encounter" and "Great Expectations".

"A Passage to India" is not a great movie.  I'd say it's about on a par with "Summertime" made by Lean in the mid-fifties.  It's overlong and you come away from it wondering what exactly happened.  I suppose that makes for interesting after-movie conversation but it's nevertheless frustrating to someone wanting more clarity.  The production values, however, are exemplary as is the acting.  I'm not sure why Maurice Jarre won the Oscar for the music.  It's also not as great as his work on "Lawrence of Arabia" or "Dr. Zhivago".
