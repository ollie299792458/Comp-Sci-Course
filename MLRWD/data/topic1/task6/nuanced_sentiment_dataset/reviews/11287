After seeing this movie with a friend, I quickly told all of my friends to go and see it. I did this because if I got swindled out of $9.75 for a movie ticket, then they should too. This movie combines the worst elements from The Matrix, Blade(1-3), and every movie that ever had terrible dialogue. This movie doesn't make the viewer sympathize with the main character, an over-the-top-semi-vampire with some blood disease that makes no sense. The best line in this movie is when the evil Bishop or Arch cardinal or whatever he was says to Violet (the semi-vampire), " You got hemo blood on me; It's on!" I laughed out loud at that line. The delivery of that and the many other terrible lines in the movie was delivered worse than a speech by a losing canidate in a political race and cheesier than cheese-whiz. If you are in a situation where you only have the choice between watching this and watching C-SPAN, pick the latter, at least you might understand what's going on and why it is, unlike Ultraviolet, the 2nd worst movie ever made.
