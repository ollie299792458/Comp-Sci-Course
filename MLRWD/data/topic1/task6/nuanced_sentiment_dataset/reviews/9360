My mother remembered this as being a good movie. After we both watched it - her for the second time, me for the first time - I had to ask her if it wasn't Flowers for Algernon she remembered. She was disappointed seeing it again, and I was not impressed either. I started losing interest when Charly began ogling his teacher, and they lost me entirely when he assaulted her. Why'd they have to put that whole bit in? I mean, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that a mentally retarded person would still be fully developed physically. I think that whole sex craze was added just for the sensational effect, a reflection of the time in which it was made. I watched this version instead of Flowers for Algernon because I didn't want to see something too kidified, but now I'm sorry I got this one instead. If you want to see a better movie than this, but along the same lines, I highly recommend The Yarn Princess, if you can get hold of it. Unlike Charly, who really has no motive to "become smart" other than for its own sake, Margaret must "become smart" or else she will lose her children. Trust me, it's way better than this one.
