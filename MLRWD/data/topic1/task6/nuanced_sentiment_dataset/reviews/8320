When this show first started, I didn't know what to expect. I was one of those that tuned in every week in the early 80's for the original V series and mini series. I found this show very different and remembering that I didn't enjoy it very much although I was disappointed when it went off the air after only 4 initial episodes. The story did plod along and I mentioned to someone that the whole thing could have been shot on a stage. Almost all of the scenes were indoors (a warehouse, FBI office, space ship, church etc). Hardly any action. But I was glad to see it return in the spring and then the story really started to pick up steam. Each week it got more interesting and I started to really look forward to the next episode. This season it has only gotten better and I've enjoyed the re-introduction of Diana's character (although I didn't realize that it was Jane Badler from the original series until her second appearance). Now I'm thinking of getting the new series on DVD, and watching the whole thing marathon style starting with the original 80's shows and continuing right into the new ones. The story has gotten stronger, there is more action such as the recent explosion that was supposed to stop the fifth column and the actors have really gotten into their characters. I think this is a very enjoyable show given the opportunity.
