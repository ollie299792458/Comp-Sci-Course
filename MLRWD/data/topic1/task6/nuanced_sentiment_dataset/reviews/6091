This is a great yoga DVD for relaxation, whether you're a beginner or advanced. The music is calm and soothing, as is her voice, she's very natural and low-key, and she doesn't talk too much during the sequence. She really gives you time to relax in the poses. As a seasoned beginner to yoga, I found there was enough movement in the sequence to keep me from getting bored, but it wasn't rushed. The first few times I did it I got that amazing tingling feeling that you get when you REALLY relax. Now, I've done the DVD so many times I have it practically memorized, so that doesn't happen anymore, but I still feel relaxed afterwards. I think even people with back, knee, and other problems will benefit from this DVD because it's a pretty gentle routine, but there is a lunge position on the floor over halfway through that could give people with bad knees some problems. Most of it is done on the floor but there is some standing and balancing about halfway into the sequence.

I've had this DVD for over a year and I still return to it time and time again to help me relax and unwind from a stressful day. Highly recommended!
