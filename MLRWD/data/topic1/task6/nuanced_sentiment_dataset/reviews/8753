This was a great show and the three previous sets in this DVD series are great. But, this set leaves me a little peeved as a huge fan of this show & as a consumer in general.

The 3rd episode on disc 1 is just horrible quality. It's as if someone burned an old VHS recorded copy onto a DVD. I can deal with that though.

Where I'm most angered is the 4th disc with two stand alone episodes with commentary by Ken Wahl. I don't mind commentary. When it's optional. I can find no set-up option on this disc to watch the episodes without the commentary. I'd love to watch these episodes and be able to hear the dialog. And I can't in the commentary mode. On all other discs in this series there is a set-up option to turn optional commentary on or off. Not on disc 4 in this set though. Hell, even disc 1 in this particular set has a set-up to turn commentary on or off.

Studio Works just did an overall bad job on this set. And there's no acceptable excuse for it. Quite frankly, I feel cheated as should all true fans of this show.
