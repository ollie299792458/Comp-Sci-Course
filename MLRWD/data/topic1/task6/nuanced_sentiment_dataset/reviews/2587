First the blu-ray the pic + sound is outstanding.  This film really pops on hd, it almost jumps of the screen and sounds just as good.  I would say its a demo worthy disc.  It has a lot of extras but I found them to be hit or miss.  B.O.BS big break out was the best extra.  The only real dissapointment with this blu-ray is they did not put the 3d version of the film as well as the 2d.

Now the film: This movie has a really great cast and smart writing. I liked how it has messages that strike a cord with adults and appeals to kids at the same time. It did have some parts that laged and stoped me giving this a perfict 5 stars.  Also the story and characters was not quite as well devolped as a pixar film or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168OINK">Kung Fu Panda (+BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>] but was still beter then most.  My favorit part of the film is how it pays tribute to movies like<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVG4">Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WQWPKA">Independence Day [Blu-ray</a>] and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MNOXZ8">The Fly [Blu-ray</a>] to name a few.  Well this is not quite in my top picks for animated films it comes close.
