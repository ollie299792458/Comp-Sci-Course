I'm a huge fan of Northern Exposure and have been waiting for years for the DVDs to finally be released. Even though I have every single episode on VHS, I still was happy to pay to have DVDs of it.

When the first NX DVD was finally released, I was shocked by the price, but thought it would be worth it because I imagined it must contain a lot of episodes for my viewing pleasure.

What I got instead was a real disappointment. It was a DVD wrapped in a cumbersome and useless "parka," and contained a mere eight episodes! This did not even remotely live up to my expectations.

The second Northern Exposure DVD is even worse! Only seven episodes!

It's appalling the way Universal is handling their release of this great show!  When will they get with it and release the complete series onto a few box sets?

Hard-core fans are willing to shell out for these DVDs, but we're all getting pretty disgusted with the way this great TV series' release is being handled. The long drawn out wait for a handful of new episodes each year is killing the momentum and good will of their audience.

And enough with the parkas! Give us CONTENT not packaging!

The show is still great to watch and the fans want very much to buy the series on DVD. Unfortunately, everyone who buys these DVDs is feeling very ripped off, frustrated and mad at Universal for their extremely untimely and ill-conceived release of this show.
