yea i still have the original playstation 2 video game max payne and i had high hopes for this movie. this movie just didn't work out for me. it really had the potential to be a lot better. needed more action scenes, it also needed better action scenes. the Norse Valkyries were pretty interesting though:)  I think they should've had a better actor play max payne. mark walberg was good in the movies THE HAPPENING and INVINCIBLE but mark walberg just doesn't work out as max payne. As i was watching this movie (which looked outstanding on blu ray disc!!!!!!), i kept thinking to myself "hey thats just mark walberg, not max payne", the character you were supposed to find believeable because of his loss of his wife and child. there is also a brief cameo by the quantum of solace bond girl, i can't remember her name though, earlier in the film who gets "killed" by the valkyries. overall this is just an okay movie. If they ever make a sequel to this movie, i hope they do a better job than this.
