This is mindless movie making at its best or worst depending on how you look at it. The action is good the hand to hand fight scenes are probally the only thing worth watching. Ray Park who is my favorite actor/ martial artist had only one whihc was diappointing and wasn't his best hence the  Star Wars light sabre battle. With the name Ballistic I was expecting to see Matrix type action but the action has no purpose. Fight scences should be apart and tell a story. But there is no story here so you have violence with no purpose. The soundtrack is killer with hard techno and Curves hell above the water but the song didn't fit into the scence where Banderas and Liu are in a chase on motorcycles which looks like they are acctually riding the electric carts at the grocery store for the hanicaped cause of how slow they are going. I kindda knew this was what I was in for with this movie story but I expected the fights and action to be something not like Matrix but at least close to it, but it fails in almost all efforts. This sorry excuse for peoples time ranks up there with XXX for the worst movie of the year of 2002.
