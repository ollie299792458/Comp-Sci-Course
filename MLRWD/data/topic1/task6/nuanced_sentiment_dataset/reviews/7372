I rented this movie because the theme sounded interesting and because it is portrayed in the front and back covers as a comedy (the description in the back even uses the word "hilarious").

I regret spending $3.99 in this rental. In no way would I classify this movie as a comedy, as it has no funny (much less "hilarious") moments.

The plot is full of holes. California is suddenly isolated from the rest of the world by a mysterious fog, with all communications severed from the outside world, but nobody (not even the governor) seems to be concerned about this!

The movie is very preachy, and after a while it just gets annoying. I have never seen a funny (or even entertaining) movie or tv show that is so preachy or tries so hard to convey a "message". It treats the audience as if they were retards e.g. interrupting every so often the flow of the movie with messages such as "there are 40 countries south of the border" or "not all latinos are mexican".

I was unable to watch the whole thing, and will certainly classify this movie as one of the worst I have seen in the past year.
