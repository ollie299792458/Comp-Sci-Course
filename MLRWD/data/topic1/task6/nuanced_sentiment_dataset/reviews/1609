Good Lord, I don't know where to begin...

Words cannot fully describe just how unbelievably bad this film is. A complete and total lack of creativity. My two children (one is 3 the other 8) were bored. I was so disappointed I joked about contacting the studio who, for some inexplicable reason, funded this complete waste of time and effort to see if I could get reimbursed for my rental fees. For the record, I'm an animator and amateur filmmaker and I can say with all honesty I have never seen such a poorly executed concept. It's obvious the film originated with someone coming up with the idea of 'what if the cops responded to a 911 call at grandma's house'. The problem is that's as far as they got with a plot. You have to be able to tell a story. This film is solid proof that just because you CAN do something (i.e. create computer animation) doesn't mean you should, at least professionally. The funniest thing in the movie...or rather the only funny thing in the movie (and that's pushing it) is the shot of the turtles yelling "RUN!" and then they ssslllooowwlllyy walk away. A sad and pathetic attempt at computer animation. Don't waste your time or your money. To me and my family, this wasn't even worth the rental fees.
