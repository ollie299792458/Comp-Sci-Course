I picked this movie up at Blockbuster one night, attracted by the name of Edward Norton. Then I glanced at the others - Robet De Niro, Marlon Brando, Angela Bassett - and I was sold. There was no way that a movie with this much sheer acting muscle behind it could be bad. 
Boy, was I had. The movie wasn't BAD; not by any means. But it was so ...ordinary... I was gaping in disbelief by the end. 
De Niro plays an aging thief who wants to quit the business to settle down with his long-time girlfriend - played by Angela in a hugely expendable role. (To make it worse, the role was an even more huge squandering of her fine abilities.) Brando, as De Niro's character's boss and old friend, was also almost as unnecessary for the storyline to progress. He hardly appears in any scenes and the ones that he is in, his "humor" is tried, tired, and forced. Norton is the youngster; the newcomer who wants to take part in the heist of a priceless artifact and show off his smarts. Norton performed beautifully, as expected. But the role was so easy and unchallenging for him, you could visibly see him "overacting," trying to wrig some dimension into his character of Jack. 
But I could find little fault in the performances of this movie. It was the story itself that was too bogged down in cliche to really fly. As far as crime-caper movies go, this one didn't break any molds, and it even felt like it lacked a climax (but that could just be me). The lack of originality and genuine inspiration ultimately cancelled out any help the superb cast could have lent. All in all, a commendable try, but hardly worth making a fuss about.
