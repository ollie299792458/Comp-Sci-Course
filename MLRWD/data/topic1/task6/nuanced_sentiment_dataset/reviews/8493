When I first heard about this and how they were going back to the book for inspiration, I thought "OK". I have the book and I re-read it so that when the movie came out, I could see how close they stuck to it. Well let me say that except for the ending, the 1969 version is truer to the book than this one. The Coen's changed scenes they didn't need to. They added characters and omitted others. I suppose they did this because they kept saying this wasn't a remake. Call it what you want, remake, reimagine, or reboot, comparisons will still be drawn. I have seen the new TRUE GRIT twice and enjoyed it more the second time BECAUSE I wasn't comparing to the 1969 version. I just wish these people who trash the original would read the book. Rooster is described as "40'ish, looks like Grover Cleveland with a walrus moustache". Also no mention of an eye patch, just that his left eye is almost completely closed. Tom Chaney is short and in his mid twenties, while LaBeof has perfectly trimmed aubern hair.

I do hope though, that now Hollywood will see people will pay to go see a well made western. Because that is what this version of TRUE GRIT is. Istill hold the original dear to my heart, but this is a decent film.

  **** Well, this version got left in the dust at the Oscars, but i seem to recall the ORIGINAL was an Oscar winner! ****
