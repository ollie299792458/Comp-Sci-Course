Show business and the film industry is brutally selective, and ethnocentric.  It is very important that there are more filmmakers and media artists for marginalized people's voices.  To all justice seeking artists, "be systematic, and persistent, and do as much as you can, always."  Address the source(s) of any problem.  As S.Lee has shown, doing true, good work and earning a comfortable income is very doable.  Language is a tool.
Aside:  In the U.S., only two parties could ever be in presidential office.  Unless the odds for the other parties become as good, there would be very little or no change in America's domestic or international conflicts.  All that is said by these two candidates before election will always be unreliable ------ this is nothing but a show.
Suggestion:
*1)  Allow only equal campaign funding and methods for all official political parties.  All political representatives of each district must daily reside in the area they are representing.  All public information(or at least the office phone numbers and the dates or websites for minutes/publications) must be made available beside every national, state, and local newspaper box in the country.
2)  *Only the popular vote is valid.*  Any complication can only be resolved by a total re-casting.
Now, could it be any more fair than that?!
Red tape serves only the ruling class, since only they make the rules.
