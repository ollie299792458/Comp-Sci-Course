In spite of the demise of Peter Sellers, Blake Edwards continued to make three more Pink Panther movies; Curse of the Pink Panther, Trail of the Pink Panther, and Son of the Pink Panther.  Trail of the Pink Panther is mainly a gathering of cut-scenes and leftover scenes from the previous Pink Panther movies pieced together to make a convoluted story of the disappearance of Inspector Clouseau... it's mildy entertaining, but a complete shambles. Son of the Pink Panther has Roberto Begnini filling the shoes of Peter Sellers as Clouseau's son... fairly well, actually... a funny comedy. But, this one, Curse of the Pink Panther is a dismally bad Peter Sellers copycat. In this movie, you have most of the standard Pink Panther characters returning... Chief Inspector Dreyfuss (Herbert Lom), Professor Balls (this time played by Harvey Korman), Kato, and David Niven and Robert Wagner. Ted Wass plays New York City police officer Sliegh, who is recruited by the French Suritee to find Inspector Clouseau. Wass tries in vain to duplicate or mimic many of the classic Clouseau gags and physical comedy done so much better by Sellers.  There is even a series of assassins who try to kill Sleigh and fumble - played out in the same way as was done in Pink Panther Strikes Again. This is a lame attempt to continue the series with a bad replacement for Peter Sellers.  If you want a good Pink Panther movie, try any of the real Peter Sellers editions, like A Shot In The Dark, Return of the Pink Panther, or Pink Panther Strikes Again - my personal favorite.
