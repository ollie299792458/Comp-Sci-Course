I LOVE the original Lion King, but when Disney announced that they were  doing a sequel to it I got rather miffed....the other sequels (like the  second Aladdin) were an insult to one's intelligence.But when I at last saw  Simba's Pride I was totally thrilled. It introduced new great characters,  enchanting songs, the story was kept pretty much in the spirit of the  original and, even though they probably never thought of doing a sequel  when they made the first one, the story's sequel was cleverly done.  The  only things I didn't like about this movie was that Rowan Atkinson (who did  Zazu's voice in the original) apparently couldn't supply his voice for the  sequel so you can tell it's someone else's voice. Unlike in the original,  the other animals (zebra's, giraffes, etc.) have a few speaking parts and  even take part in one of the songs.  The animation isn't as good as the  original but it's still great and I thought a lot better than the other  Disney sequels.These are just minor things of course, I'm a bit of a  perfectionist when it comes to animation. I love this as much as the  orignal and I truly hope they do yet another Lion King sequel.
