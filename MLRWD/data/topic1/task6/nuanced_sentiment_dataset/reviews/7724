There is NO way a beginner could use this video.  The movements are gentle enough for those who are not in great shape to do without getting too winded, but there is no explanation at all.  Every movement is done full-speed from the very beginning.  They are not slowed down, they are not described; the viewer is just expected to know what she's doing.  Each segment takes each movement individually and then puts them all together into a combination, but there is really no good reason for this, since you are just expected to watch Naia and mimic her.  Upper body movements and lower body movements are not separated to start with, either.  I am fairly coordinated and do not yet have a big belly, but I was not able to pick up all of these movements just by watching her at regular speed.  The workout would probably be boring for experienced bellydancers.  The only reason to purchase this DVD instead of something else is that it has already eliminated the few movements which may not be recommended during pregnancy.
