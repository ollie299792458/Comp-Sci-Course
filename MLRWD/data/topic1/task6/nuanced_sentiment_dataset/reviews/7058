Let me sum up the movie thusly:
1. We have a drinking game that my friends and I do. Every time you see a NOS sticker or someone says "NOS", you drink. I doubt you'll make it halfway thru the movie.
2. For cars doing 10 second 1/4 miles, a 1/4 mile race takes like 2 minutes.
3. If you blow your engine up and destroy the rings and such, let it rest for a few minutes. It'll be good as new and be able to run from the police in about 5 minutes time. It just needed to catch it's breath. 
4. If you are trying to carjack a semi, the driver will be considerate enough for you to fire a grappling hook thru his windshield then match your speed so you can come across the line and into the cab. He would never be so inconsiderate as to swerve or hit his brakes or something. That would just be rude.
5. When building up a 2JZ engine in a Supra, it's a simple matter to overnight performance parts from Japan. Ummm...I can't overnight performance parts from Japan! And I LIVE in Japan!
I could go on and on but you kinda get the point. If you know nothing about tuning cars and are willing to totally suspend belief in reality for a few hours, by all means go see this movie. The soundtrack is quite good. If you do a lot of car tuning, however, be prepared to cringe and be prepared for everyone and their dog to ask you if you have NOS in your car.
Oh and don't worry if the floorboard of your car falls off in the middle of one of those 2 minute quarter miles. That's a common occurance. We just pick em back up and move on. Now that I think about it, that must be how his car was able to run from the police after blowing the engine up. He must've been Flintstoning it.
