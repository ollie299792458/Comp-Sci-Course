Reese Witherspoon plays Tracy Flick, a straight-A go-getter intent on becoming student body president at Carver High School, no matter what the cost.  And the cost proves very high, indeed, after mild-mannered civics teacher Mr. McAllister (Matthew Broderick) enlists dim-bulb football hero Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against Flick.  Adding to the chaos is a the last-minute candidacy of Metzler's lesbian sister, whose tell-it-like-it-is counter-cultural campaign draws the ire of school administrators even as it draws cheers from her fellow students.

Broderick is wonderful as Mr. McAllister, the well-meaning but naive and flawed (as it turns out) civics teacher whose subtle meddlings lead to disastrous consequences, personally and professionally.  And Witherspoon captures perfectly the driven (by a manipulative mother as well as her own inner demons) mover-and-shaker who knows only that she must get to the top, but never seems to ask why or at what cost, or what it all means.

Wild and crazy as the movie is, it never seems unbelievable, going just a little bit beyond yesterday's headlines of real life high school hanky panky.  Warning:  some crude language and simulated sex might prove embarrassing if you watch this with your pre-adult children, of any age.  In my opinion, it's a borderline PG-13 verging towards "R."
