A classic of the 80's teen drama era.  This movie takes to extremes the "kids against adults" theme of the teen movies of the 80's.  If nothing more, this movie is HILARIOUS.  It was probably not intended so, and when I was 5 and this movie was new, I thought it was rather cool.  It's a great flick to sit around with a bunch of your friends and let off some steam with a good laugh.

The premise of the film is simple.  Well, actually it isn't simple at all; making it one of the reasons this movie is so over the top.  You see, Billie Jean tries to retrive money for motorcycle repairs for her brother from the father of the boy who damaged it.  He makes unwanted advances and the impatient brother breaks into the cash register at the man's store, finds a gun and accidentally shoots the man, leading the group of friends to go into hiding.  They find their way into a wealthy house where they team up with a rich kid in a fake kidnapping ploy to get the money.  Everything escalates as the group becomes famous and infamous in television and on radio over this incident, which in real life would have ended in the kids being quickly arrested and prosecuted.

Pat Benetar's "Invincible" is also a classic of the era, and quite fitting in the theme of the film trying too hard to be serious, and producing a comedy in its place.  Seeing Yeardley Smith before she grows up, and Christian Slater starring opposite Helen Slater (not actually related) as a blond teenager, is worth the whole package.  Peter Coyote plays the sympathetic cop.  Al from Quantum Leap and Rodney Dangerfield's son in the movie Back to School (I can't remember their names) make appearances as father and son.  If you think about it, it was really an "all-star cast," or so one might have thought at the time...

The last time I watched this movie with some friends, we all laughed so hard our sides hurt.

The only unfortunate thing is that it is not available on DVD.
