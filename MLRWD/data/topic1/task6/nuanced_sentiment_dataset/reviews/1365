I did not know much about Reagan except his attempted assassination, his wife consulting astrologers to help in making

decisions for the country, Starwar's, his memory problems, Iranian bits and pieces, and the Bitburg incident. The movie filled in some of my gaps so it was a history lesson to some extent, but to me, the movie seemed shallow and forced. As for a review I saw which said how how dare they sour the name of one of the geatest presidents we ever had for instance with the Bitburg incident, all I could say is I'm sorry.

This movie was made using public accounts as stated at the beginning, and it is totally true that Reagan said what the reviewer used not as a criticism of Reagan, but as a reason to

portray this president as perfect, and the movie producers as rot. How low can this reviewer go and how low did Reagan go as well to say that the Nazi killers buried at Bitburg were surely as much victims as those in the concentration camps! This reviewer is absolutely ignorant or a twistering idiot. The fact is that Reagan did say the above regarding Bitburg Nazi's and by saying this, Reagan has diminished his moral stature to say the least. See for example 'Chutzpah' by A.Dershowitz, pgs.134-135.
