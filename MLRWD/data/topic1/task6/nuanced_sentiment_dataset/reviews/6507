Austin Powers might have been annoying, but this is just plain awful.  Not only are there no hard laughs or guffaws, there are no decent laughs period.  This is simply a tedius movie with very few chuckles.  When the two funniest scenes in the movie involve sight gags with Mr. Rowan Atkinson and his gun (accidentally dropping the clip out of his gun and the chamber sliding off his weapon) you know you are buckled into an unfunny ride.  The fault does not lie at the feet of Mr. Rowan, who does a good job with the material.  He's like a modern Peter Sellars.  I wish he was the top choice for future Pink Panther movies instead of Steve Martin. Neither does the fault lie with the script.  Obviously, satirizing this genre has been done to death, but often it can still be funny. Call it old reliable. I'm placing the blame here on bad editing--that is, this film has no sense of comedic timing.  It should have been required that the editors of this movie watch the early Pink Pather films, Casino Royale, and the pre-90's Zucker-Zucker-Abrams movies.  Comedy like this is not genius, it is predictable.  It is the execution of the gag which is funny, and unfortunately, the editors of this film thought they were editing a romantic comedy. Austin Powers succeeded because it was a spoof that spoofed even it's own comedy genre, and because it had good direction and good editing.  They went into it thinking they had a unique spoof.  Johnny English fails because it is routine and it didn't even have the guts to go balls-out comedy because it was relying on the premise to carry the whole movie.  Because the editing was more appropriate for a John Hughes movie.  Because James Bond himself does a better job of satirizing the genre.  Save your rental money on this one.  Rent the first three Pink Panthers instead.  Or, just rent some non-Sean Connery James Bond flicks.  They are a better laugh.
