Very dissapointed with how this movie turned out. I don't where the script writers came out with younger brother angle , but it doesn't work.  Rule One : Don't rewrite histories of established , tried-and-true ,bread -and-butter characters , geez! Some scenes are very reminiscient of Akira and Dragonball Z , only very hacknyed and lame. Too much groaning and powering for SF in my opinion.  The whole movie kinda floats around with barely any screentime for all those new Alpha fighters. The movie SHOULD have been based around a tournament , with nice, lengthy fights..only nauseating or incredibly short fights here.
And the character designs are ugly and very strange..I loved the art in Street Fighter II V...how can they drop the ball on a feature film?!
On to the DVD, video and sound quality are excellent , and I was pleased by the extras (interviews with the REAL cast for once). And the requisite trailers..if you are SF fanatic or completist , then go ahead pick it up. Otherwise , look elsewhere.
