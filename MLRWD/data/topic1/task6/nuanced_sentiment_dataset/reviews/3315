And if you're a Hanks fan (and who isn't anymore), you probably can too. Some may think 4 stars is too lofty an accolade for so bubble-gummy a film. Well, realize, that in my estimation, what makes a film great is how close it comes to fulfilling its purpose and that that purpose be of benefit to the viewer. That Thing You Do comes close to perfection on both counts, even though it is no Schindler's List. 
And who wants every movie to be a 'Schindler's List'? We need a That Thing You Do almost as much, and I commend and admire Hanks for making his debut directorial effort not a Braveheart or Dances With Wolves. Whether he felt the pressure to be profound or not, Hanks' diverges to the road less travelled by actors-turning-directors/actors. He wants us to have fun. And not mindless 'Weekend At Bernies' fun, but "look at the charm of this era and its music" fun.
While none of its departments probably got nominated (or even should have been) for Oscars, each aspect, from art direction to make-up to costumes, flows together under Hanks' vision well to sweep us up into the exuberance of a dream coming true (wonderfully personified in the scene where the band hears their song on the radio for the first time). The cast is particularly well assembled (Tom Everett Scott pulling somewhat of an O'Donnell in that he still hasn't, for me, lived up to the promise he showed here) with now notables Steve Zahn (Out of Sight) and Giovanni Ribisi (Saving Private Ryan) establishing their now familiar funny and eclectic (respectively) styles.
If you like oldies and get a bit nostalgic for the era of the 50's and 60's, That Thing You Do should be on your list of 'Thing's to do. The odd thing is that the soundtrack showcases exclusively original tunes. Have you ever seen a movie about this era that doesn't grab as many of the popular oldies as they can for its soundtrack? What's really amazing is that almost all of them sound like hits!
