I don't review often, but I felt the need to in this case.  This is one of the rare times I've really had a hard time distinguishing between my prior high-bitrate DVD and a Blu-ray.  Yeah, it's a little sharper, but nothing that makes you think "WOW! Now THIS is HD!"  Part of that, I'd have to attribute to the original film.  This is a movie I saw five times--my personal best, ever--in the theater, and I do remember that the print seemed a bit grainy, like the film stock they'd used wasn't all that spectacular.  I do support the natural treatment of film, though, so I'm glad they didn't attempt to sharpen the film and use DNR to give it that glossy, HD look.

Overall, it's worth the $10 you'd pay for it.  The commentary track is from one of the old DVD's and fully illustrates that Arnold is perhaps one of the funniest, and worst, celebrity commentators ever.  He simply doesn't understand what's expected of him.  Verhoeven, however, is terrific both in the commentary and the supplementary interview, which was clearly filmed more recently and in HD.

Overall, I gave the Bluray three stars.  The film itself I give four and a half, but I think the reviews should be more about the quality of the disc than about what you thought of the film.  (That's what Rottentomatoes is for.)
