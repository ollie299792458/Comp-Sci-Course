I know, there are some people with IQ lower than their shoe size that like this movie, but I am not one of them so I make my opening statement being...Was the director's name...Ed Wood? (For those who do not know Ed Wood he was the director of the named "Worst movie of the Century/Golden Turkey Award winner, Plan Nine From Outer Space)
First of all I've heard many people talk about the "Amazing Swordplay." It may be because I fence, I thought the so called "sword play" was horrible. I mean...It was pretty much, "Oh, you've come to try to attack me, let me hit you with this big piece of lead and you come and I hit you...etc. etc."
Now the "acting." When watching the movie I began wishing "The Rock" were in fact, a rock. It would certainly be FAR more interesting, and fun to watch. I know it's mostly because he's a wrestler, but still. Suggestion to the director: How about you see if some one can act BEFORE casting him/her!
The only slightly good thing was the fact that it was in a desert, and uh...I think I saw a plot line once or twice!
The dumbest line in the movie award goes to: "And then she says, 'It's not the size of the hump that counts, but the motion of the camel!'"
