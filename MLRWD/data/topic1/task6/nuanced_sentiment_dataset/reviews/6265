With the begining of the film showing us the gruesome act of 54 joyous high-school girls jumping into the path of an on-coming train, "Suicide Club" is one of the most graphic and intensely bizarre films in any type of film.  Here is a movie, the prime example of self re-examination, that will leave you in a twisted state of mind that you may or may not be able to comprehend.  I found myself at the end of the movie, questioning my own beliefs and morals.  "Do i actually have that connection w/ myself?"  "Do i know myself as much as i believe?"  "If i were to die, would my self-sacrafice make me closer to the people around me?"  "Does my life matter?"  It terrified me that a movie, of all things, could do this kind of thing to a person.
I also believe it to be a movie with multiple meanings.  There is no possible way that every person who sees this will come up with the same meanings at the end.  I found it to be giving a warning: Do not let pop culture and peer pressure influence your morality, common sense, pride and courage.  You have the ability to say no or break free from the expectations of society and all their proverbial boxes.

Do not expect to see a movie of camera turn-aways when a person(s) dies, it shows all the blood, no censorship.  And let me tell you, i was very happy to see such disgusting and disturbing images on my big-screen t.v.
"Suicide Club" is a great buy, even if you have not seen it before.  I bought this movie w/out seeing it, and i was amazed.  But it is definitely a movie you won't be able to watch day after day.  You might have to wait a few days to watch it again because it will keep you thinking and keep you very, very disturbed.  I know, i have only watched it once and still can't bring myself to watch it again yet...its been three days.  Highly Reccomended for gore-fans, intellects, thinkers, philosephers and so on.
