It has been fantastic to watch J.T. Tepnapa and Carlos Pedraza's project evolve over the years and their film has turned out great! "Judas Kiss" is independent and low-budget, but through (mostly) excellent acting, vibrant camera work, editing, and the magical realism plot and effects, it rises above similar fare to become something I will return to often  just like I have with other gay favorites like "Shelter", "Trick", and "Latter Days".)

There were only a couple of flaws I find with this film. First, the roles for the women are not especially complex and are somewhat stereotypical. The women friends of gay men are simply not so narrowly defined in real life. Second, there is a wide range of acting talent on display, most of it leaning toward excellent, but some of it a tad bit rough. Still, that adds, for me at least, a sense of charm to this movie.

"Judas Kiss" represents what I hope is a new direction for gay cinema: a variety of subject matters and new approaches to framing gay life.
