Venice. The beautiful and voluptuous gem of the Mediterranean. A city like no other with her bawdy history of Courtesans, gentile society, and decadence.

Dangerous Beauty pits the lavish and indulgent life style of the fair city of Venice against the zealous tyranny of the "church" during the time of the Inquisition. Believing that God's wrath had been stirred by the public sinfulness of a modern-day Sodom, the church seeks to remedy the Plague by rooting out wickedness - including the liscentious life style of the courtesans.

But our heroine, brilliantly played by Catherine McCormack, bravely defends the traditions which allowed her to make a living in a society that shut the door on the aspirations of women. In the social system of the time, women either were born to wealth or married it. Anything less meant a life of servitude in the under-class.

At the root, this film is about power. A woman's power in this day, in this city, lay in her beauty or her birth.

Excellent performances, beautiful sets and scenery, acting talent galore.
