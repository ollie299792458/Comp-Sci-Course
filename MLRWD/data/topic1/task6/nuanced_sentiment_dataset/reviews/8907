Rather than trying to learn about history from movies or TV shows, perhaps we should study history books written by scholars and ancient contemporaries.  We would then discover that Theophilus did not call for the destruction of a library but of centers of idol worship.  The Alexandrian "library" did not at that time contain any scrolls--they had all been destroyed centuries earlier (either before Christianity existed or while it was still a small, illegal sect). The last remaining great library of the ancient world was preserved by the Christians in Byzantia (Constantinople).  Although we would all like to blame the Christians for the sunset of a golden age of reason, fires were the great destroyers of ancient libraries.  That, however, doesn't make for very interesting movies. Also some of the other "reviewers" should remember not to judge a faith when some of it's followers do something bad.  It's like blaming Buddha for Pearl Harbor.  That would be reasonable if religious adherents always acted in perfect conformity with the teachings of their founders.  Unfortunately, they do not.
