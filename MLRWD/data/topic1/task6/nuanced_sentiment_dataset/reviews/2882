Cooper Layne .. you suck as a writer. If you are going to change things around when writing a remake of a horror favorite, at least make changes that improve upon the original, NOT make it worse. The motive for the original ghosts return was not only to get their gold, it was for a little something called revenge. There was absolutely no need to add on this whole storyline about the Elizabeth character having a link to Blake. The movie isn't as bad as everyone on here makes it out to be, the updated effects are good, the flashbacks to 1871 are interesting, and I do like the actors. The real let downs are that the characters are so differently played out from the ones in the original movie. No one appreciated seeing the whole lighthouse scene at the end being taken out, nor the beginning scenes when the town goes haywire. The scenes of the attacks on the Seagrass and at Stevie's house when the ghosts come for Andy are just aweful and in no way come close to comparison to the original. The attack at the weather station on Dan is cool though as is the way that they kill the lazy aunt babysitting Andy. Also very much missed the original creepy score that did wonders for setting the mood. All in all, a very different movie with changes that were not all entirely good.
