Ok, this movie wasnt so good...it was ok, but not good. Mostly if you had NEVER read the book then you could make it work for you, maybe. I for one went to see this movie becuase i loved the book "Blood and Chocolate" by Annette Kurtis Clause. I was sadly disapointed to find that the ONLY things this movie had in common with the original book was: It was about werewolves, the girls name was Vivian. Thats it. NOTHING in this movie was anything like the book. I know that movies based on books are almost always a dissapointment but this was SO badly done it was ridiculous. Since the rating was only PG13 i dont even know WHY they changed Vivians character...the only reason the book is even seen as somewhat controversial is becuase Vivian starts the book as a 15 year old girl that loves to think about sex (what young teenager doesnt?) to make this less of a BIG deal they changed her to a 20something chocolatier that doesnt even live in the US (again having nothing to do with the book, she is in HIGHSCHOOL in a southern state possibly Tennessee with all the moutnains). Overall, like i said if you had NEVER read the book you might be able to overlook most of the cornyness...otherwise be prepared to be dissapointed.
