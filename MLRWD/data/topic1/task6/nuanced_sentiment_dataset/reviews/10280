Wow! I remember being so excited at the sight of the TV promos for this show back in the day but thought the show was just okay went it actually aired in 1990. Boy, was I wrong. It was awful!!! The creators/producers wanted the show to be faster than a speeding bullet but it's duller than a  rubber knife and dumber than a bag of rocks (and I've met some pretty dumb rocks). Coming off the heels of the 1989 blockbuster BATMAN, I see what they were going for...and certainly the score (by Elfman himself) and the overall look ofthe show hold up. However, the dialogue is cliche at best and the performances are painfully overwrought or just plain flat. Scenes that should be heartfelt are corny. Jokes that want to be funny are corny. Villains that are supposed to be manacing are...you guessed it...corny. Add in zero extras and this just isn't worth it. Trust me and save your receipt. Unless you still think programs like Knight Rider and The A-Team are great TV, you'll be taking this DVD set back to the store in a flash!
