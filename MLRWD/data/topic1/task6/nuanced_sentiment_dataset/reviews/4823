King David, the hero of Israel, is performed very well by Gregory Peck, who falls in love with Bathsheba ( Susan Hayward ), a beautiful woman married to one of his army captains Uriah ( Kieron Moore ). David decides to send Uriah into a hard battle to get rid of a disturbing husband. This film is the story of a sin and a redemption, though nowadays more than 3000 years later, that sin would not exist, I think, and for this there would not be any reason to send Uriah to battle, besides going to battle was one of the best gifts that a warrior as Uriah could receive.

  An abandoned married woman Bathsheba lives by King David and at times both of them can see by chance the other one at home, besides Bathsheba has no company, no love and no sex for years, because his busy husband likes to be at the war against the Philistines ( ancient inhabitants of Palestine ), and behaves as if his wife were only a flowerpot. After being a long time at the war front Uriah comes back only for a day and decides to sleep at the barracks of the army instead of staying at home that night with his wife, a big humiliation for his wife indeed!, unfortunately their marriage were settled by their parents. Both David and Bathsheba like each other, so David only wants to get that abandoned flower at his best before it withers. A bit aggresive and superstitious prophet Nathan ( played well by Raymond Massey ) fights for justice and accuses David of living in sin, of causing the destruction ( ?! ) of Israel, and moves the mob to trow stones at Bathsheba, according to law. The ending of the movie is fair and nice, both lovers are forgiven by God's love and can live as a true married couple for ever.

The technicolor of the film is wonderful.
