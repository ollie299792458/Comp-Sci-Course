I've read the book and seen the film in the theater. I must say that this may be the first time in history where the film is actually better than the book. Which says a lot, because the book is fantastic.
I like the fact that the film never reveals who the "low men" are ... the book's explanation felt more like a comercial for another of King's books (if you've read "Hearts in Atlantis", you know what I mean). On a side note ... the reviewer that insists that the low men are FBI agents is completely wrong. Their identity is never revealed in the film. It isn't even hinted that they're FBI.
The film is essencially a cross between the film Stand By Me and an episode of X Files. There's a spookiness to the main story, which focuses around Bratigan's claravoyance. But, the back story is a believable, nostalgic look at growing up. Anyone that has fallen in love with the girl next door, or has been threatened by the neighborhood bully can relate.
The film is based on the first of five stories in King's novel Hearts in Atlantis. It would be interesting to see sequels based on the other stories. However, based on the film's reception by critics, I won't hold my breath.
