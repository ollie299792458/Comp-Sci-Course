Between the lackluster acting and the awful special effects, I can only imagine that people enjoy Supergirl for either nostalgia or schadenfreude. The movie does feature Peter O'Toole, who does his best with the awful dialogue,and Helen Slater is definitely a good fit for Supergirl. Unfortunately, neither can save this movie from being the utter schlock that it is.

From the very beginning this movie lacks any sort of logic. Just to get started, here is the premise: Supergirl comes to earth in order to find her colony's only power source, a walnut-sized ball which she lost after playing with it near a window - feel free to soak that in for a minute. And even though her entire family will soon die without this power-source, she wastes her time enrolling in school and hanging out with Lois Lane's little sister. In addition to this, there are all sorts of inconsistencies throughout the movie. For example, Supergirl has no idea what a "train" is, yet she has no problem forging a recommendation letter from her cousin Clark Kent.

While watching this movie I couldn't stop asking, Why? Why? Why? ... Why was the evil Selena (Faye Dunaway) so focused on making a hunk fall in lover with her when her goal was supposedly to take over the world? Why did Supergirl hijack the space ship to Earth when Zaltar (Peter O'Toole) was clearly more competent at searching for the power-source? Why did Supergirl stay in math class when she knew the power-source was right outside the school? These are all issues which the script failed to address.

Supergirl manages to be the worst of the 70s/80s era superman franchise. Even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IJ79XE">Superman IV - The Quest for Peace (Deluxe Edition)</a> somehow surpasses this garbage. Do yourself a favor and avoid Supergirl.
