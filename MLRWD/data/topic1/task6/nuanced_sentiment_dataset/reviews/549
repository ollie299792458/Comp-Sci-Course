Blair Witch meets Lord of the Flies meets Videodrome meets Big Brother. Phew! quite a hootenanny. The first hour of this movie is more psychosocial study than horror movie. The group of damaged young people living in the isolated house in the hope of sharing a million dollar prize get on each others' nerves, bicker incessantly, and lust unrequitedly. This part of the film is less successful than the final half hour in which the mayhem finally kicks off. It's during the last week of their six-month incarceration that the true reason for their being there is revealed, and during which the nastiness rapidly escalates. The audience's viewpoint alternates between the numerous webcams inside the house, including night vision cameras, and the conventional camera of the film maker. This technique is effective at producing an intimacy and urgency to the drama. Unfortunately the final resolution is something of a letdown. But this is still quite entertaining and should at least moderately satisfy most fans of the genre.
