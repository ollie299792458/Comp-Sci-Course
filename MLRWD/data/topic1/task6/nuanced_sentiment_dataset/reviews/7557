As a huge Agatha Christie fan, I have read all of the Hercule Poirot books and have watched all of David Suchet's renditions of Poirot in movies and the TV series of short stories.  I was particularly looking forward to the release of Series 5 because it has Murder on the Orient Express, Christie's most famous and most creative book.  But I was very disappointed by the way that the writers of this set deviated from the books to change the nature of the story and of Poirot himself.

I understand that all the movies of her books must contain some deviations from the book to make for good film, but in the earlier renditions of Christie's books, they stayed true to the essence of the book and of Hercule Poirot himself.  There was no reason for them to deviate from the books this time around.

Christie's genius was most apparent in Murder on the Orient Express, and the movie could have been very successful if it had stayed true to the nature of Agatha Christie's creation.  But instead of the highly controlled, methodical Poirot, we saw a Poirot who yelled and screamed and made decisions based upon his Catholic faith, which was not characteristic of the true Poirot.  I was especially upset that they actually changed the ending of the book!

In the "Making of" extra that accompanied Appointment with Death, David Suchet claimed that the original book was impossible to make into a movie, a claim I found difficult to believe.  They twisted the story into something that hardly resembled the original book.

I was very disappointed with this set and only give it three stars because the acting itself was excellent, and if you were not familiar with the original books, you might enjoy it.  But if you are a true Agatha Christie fan, you will be very disappointed at the way the Hercule Poirot books have been twisted as much as the Miss Marple books have been of late.
