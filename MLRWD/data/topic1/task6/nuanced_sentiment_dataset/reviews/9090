What the hell did I just watch? First, the premise that everyone is sleeping with everyone else and screwing up everything and everyone around them is nothing new. However, that people like Clooney would even consider sleeping with old, physically worn and utterly obnoxious quarry is patently ridiculous. That John Malkovich [Osbourne Cox] didn't require vocal chord surgery after his endless rants is alone interesting, I suppose.That [Katie] Tilda Swinton isn't playing the role of spinster, rather than anyone remotely interesting to any man on this planet - particularly George Clooney - rocks the mind. That Brad Pitt [Chad] would stoop so low. And last but not least, IS Linda [Frances McDormand] who is the most irritating and illogically sketched characters in modern cinema, and the only sociopath who makes it out of this thing in one piece. In short, this movie obliterates the concept of suspension of disbelief because people can't suspend it that long.

Having said this, the acting was superb on all fronts, if you like attending acting workshops where storyline is subordinate to performance.
