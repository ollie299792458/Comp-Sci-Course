Although this film has several merits due to its cinematography and interesting coverage of the processes that are involved in electing the next Pope, I found parts of the dialogue and scripting weak and illogical on the basis of how the Church has historically behaved.  The very fact that Pope Kiril decides to sell all the Church's assets to feed the hungry is quite frankly absurd, because much of the Church's property simply cannot be liquified.

The dialogues with Fr. Telemond and theological commission observing him seemed to me more like an apologetic for the ideas of Fr. Teilhard de Chardin than anything else.  The arguments of those interrogating him could have been presented more rigorously, but then the movie would have morphed into a very involved discussion of Christology, Anthropology and Soteriology. In my estimation the subplot with Fr. Telemond was obtrusive, as was the subplot with the TV newsman and his domestic affairs.

Anthony Quinn's performance in my opinion was weak at times and lacked necessary vigor and pathos.  If I ever watch this movie again it will be to see the drama of electing a Pope, not the daily duties of a Pontiff.
