I bought this movie after reading the glorious reviews herein. In truth, this movie could be the worst movie I've ever seen.  Basically, the movie is about an angel who decides he wishes to become mortal so as to be with the woman of his affections.  But one has to suffer through a seemingly endless procession of supposedly average people who don't talk... it is their thoughts you hear.  Be it a prostitute, a man on a train or a woman walking on the street, their thoughts are badly written, but incredibly deep philisophical prose.  So very, very deep.  So thought-provoking.  So absolutely inane!  Nobody thinks like this.  No, the writer is going to show his "talents" as a poet, a psychologist, a philosopher.  Nobody thinks the way these supposedly average people do. It's just the movie-maker's futile attempt to appear as deep and intellectual.  What a joke.  Even my wife, who is French and is truly enjoys the European-style of movies, couldn't last the entire film.  It is that bad.  By the way, it is filmed in the Berlin-wall period, so you can only imagine the happy ambiance that provides.  I know, it adds the melancholy and the perfect scenario for the film being in black and white.  It's garbage.  Can I give it zero stars?
