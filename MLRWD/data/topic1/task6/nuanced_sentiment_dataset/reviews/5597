The prints for both movies are in rough shape, but I personally found the movies entertaining and watchable nonetheless.
I bought this DVD primarily for "Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet" (which, as a previous viewer pointed out, used footage from the Russian "Planeta Burg") which I hadn't seen since the mid 70s. Despite the obvious flaws and rough condition of the print, it's still a great movie, and I'm glad it was offered even in this budget form.
I think a far more interesting DVD compilation would have been to  pair up "Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet" with "Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women" (which also employed the same "Planeta Burg" footage), or better yet, offer all 3 movies, the original "Planeta Burg", "Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet" and "Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women" on the same disc ,
rather than the choice of "First Spaceship on Venus".

"First Spaceship" it still an entertaining movie, despite its poor quality, but for hard-core enthusiasts it is already available elsewhere on another disc in the widescreen format, so apparently it's already received a 5 star treatment.  But for casual viewers the Diamond print may suit just fine.
