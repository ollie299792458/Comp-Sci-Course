This movie has definitely proven that Disney is no longer the king on top of the animation film genre. The digital animation studio PDI and Dreamworks have certainly earned that spot with "Shrek". In terms of quality, story, believable characters, humor, and the mind-blowing, eye-popping CG-animation, "Shrek" has surpassed Disney &amp; Pixar a million times over. Just take a look at their latest release "Monsters Inc." Although "Monsters Inc." is not a bad film, my own kids still chose to watch "Shrek" over again after watching "Monsters Inc". And as an adult, if I had to make a choice  between watching "Monsters Inc" or "Shrek" in the theater again, I'd honestly pick "Shrek". Maybe its the "magic" about it, but I just can't seem to get tired of watching it over again everytime my kids pop the dvd in the player. I just keep getting amazed by the animation and keep laughing at all the jokes over again. Believe me, the movie is THAT GOOD. As a final word, I can definitely say "Shrek" is next year's Oscar winner for best animated film. You just mark my words.
