For those who have read the other reviews, it will be needless to state that this is a fine movie.  It is!  You will be the richer for having experienced it.  The opening sequences in particular--the sounds of the city, the unique journey of "Isn't It Romantic"--captivate the mind.  But the enthusiastic praise heaped on it with obviously grateful and loving hands does a dis-service to new viewers, who will sit down in front of the show with expectations of something rather different than the show turns out to be.  Unless your definition of "movie musical" is very different from that of most, this is not the greatest film musical ever; but it certainly is a refreshingly different one.  Some of the songs are standards; others you won't remember five minutes later.  Those interested in movie musicals look for exciting dance sequences--you won't find them here.  Do we care a great deal about the characters?  Nope.  Lots of hilarity?  No; but you will have a laugh or two.  Scintillating lyrics?  You won't know unless you have a libretto to look at, what with Chevalier's accent and MacDonald's operatic style of singing.  And this ends up diminishing the integrity of the show, because the average member of the audience won't have heard some things he needed to know, things which came only from the lyrics (for instance, the very last image in the movie is a response to something trilled not very clearly an hour previously).  The performances are solid, the sets wonderful, the music pleasant, the pace quick, the camera work beautiful, the scenes and characters varied, and so on...  For what it is, it's faultless, and you will smile with contentment at the end.  But it is sui generis--in a category by itself--and the audience member should come to it with meter set closer to "mild screwball comedy with songs" than to "one of the great movie musicals."  Enjoy it!  But don't think you're going to be getting "Show Boat" . . .
