I expected a lot of this movie. I expected BIG, and all I got was small. I gave it 1 star because of the death scenes, which were pretty gruesome. Besides this, it wouldn't even have deserved one single star. I didn't buy it but borrowed it in order to find out if it's worth purchasing.
It's not. I got the Final Destination DVD, because I love that movie. It's cool, entertaining and scary - all of which the sequel ain't. Predictability isn't always bad in movies, but to FD2 it was a killer. I don't necessarily mean it was predictable how they were gonna die. Yet, where the first movie was startling and surprising, the sequel only proved a boring copy, with actors so unbelievably stereotype and unreal I regret having struggled not to fall asleep.
As another rewiever put it, I also hope they're not gonna make a third movie - because FD2's senselessness and stupidity can hardly be beaten.
If you're really into that kind of movies, you might like it just the same. But trust me - I'm one of those people who get easily taken with all kinds of movies, especially being a fan of thrill/horror. FD2 I despised. They shouldn't have made a sequel. Final Destination was too good for a sequel.
Just unnecessary.
