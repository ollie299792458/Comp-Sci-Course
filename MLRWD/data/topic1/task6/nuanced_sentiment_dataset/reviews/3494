What a glorious, uplifting movie this is. A great cri de coeur against war and hatered, and in favor of tolerance and peace. That the message it presents is, by this point, somewhat of a given does nothing to diminish its importance.

You doubtless know of the plot by now. Charlie Chaplin, a man with a moustache suspiciously similar to a certain unpleasant fellow in history, plays the role of an anti-Semetic dictator named Hinkel and a poor Jewish barber. That these two look exactly the same is obvious. That the fact doesn't come in handy until the end is somewhat unexpected, but still great.

The movie avoids getting bogged down in all the obvious traps that await a film with content such as this. It doesn't become preachy until the very last couple minutes when the Little Tramp (not called that, but let's face it, he is), stands and makes a speech that most people seem to feel brings the film to a grinding halt. Not I. I really liked it and the statements therein. They were obvious, but needed to be said. That they still do need saying is a sad commentary on where we are versus where we should be.

This disc includes some amazing special features, such as behind-the-scenes color footage and the usual trailers, etc. What makes for a really nice bonus, however, is the inclusion of a documentry on the relationship between Hitler and Chaplin (born only a few days apart). It includes a lot of information on this movie as well as, stunningly, some great photos showing Hitler in a crowd in Berlin on the day war was declared back in 1914.

This movie is worth every penny you pay for it, but if you want to get it at a good price, buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000096IBS">The Chaplin Collection, Vol. 1 (Modern Times / The Great Dictator / The Gold Rush / Limelight)</a>, and you can get not only this movie, but three other great films as well. Not a bad deal!

This is the first Chaplin film I've seen and to this date the only one of his movies I've seen more than once. The fact that I'm now willing to buy every single one of his films on the basis of this and the other one I've seen, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000096IBI">Modern Times (2 Disc Special Edition)</a>, speaks well of Chaplin in general and this movie in particular.

You really owe it to yourself to see this film.
