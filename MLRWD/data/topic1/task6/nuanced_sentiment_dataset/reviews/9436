If you are like me, after watching the first 15 minutes you'll get that "oh man, this movie isn't looking too good."  Hopefully, unlike me, you'll immediately pop the movie out and throw it from the nearest window.  It is god-awful(pun intended).  This movie is like se7en, except for the good acting, original plot, etc.  Basically, its dark and dark for good reason, to cover up the bad acting.  Also, if you think there's a cliche coming in the next scene, you got it.  
The plot in a nutshell is this: You have the standard turn down of immortality from a wierdo, then said wierdo kills the priest's sex-kitten; like the priest didn't see that coming! The characters also make the standard idiot decisions in movies.  If they are about to leave a place of unspeakable evil where everyone wants to kill them, one of them decides to go back in alone.  ARGGGH!!!1  I can't tell you how it ends because, guess what, I took it out 15 minutes before the end.  I'm glad I saved those 15 minutes.  Trust me, this movie sucks, don't go near it.
