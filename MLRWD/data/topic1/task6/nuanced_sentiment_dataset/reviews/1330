I couldn't imaguine what could be so exciting about a movie of two people locked in a room. It turned out to be a great edge-of-your-seat thriller. Jodie Foster again demonstrates what a fabulous actress she really is. The film blew my mind away. Jodie Foster was so great in this film. I heard that Nicole Kidman was originally supposed to be the leading role, but she was injured while filming Moulin Rouge so she didn't have enough time to heal and be in Panic Room. I was kinda mad about that but what can you do?
It is a great suspense thriller with many twists, superb acting and wonderful camera work. The ending could be better. There is no surprise. It's quite a simple story - mother(Foster) and daughter are home alone in a big(really big, actually!)house - it's the middle of the night and three burglas come calling, after the contents of a safe kept in the 'panic room' of the house.
Mother and daughter retreat to the safety - or so they hope - of the specially built room, while the three men try various ways to get them out, and mother and daughter fight to generally survive and get help.
The film engages the viewer and makes them think about what they've just seen. It doesn't just come right out and explain everything to the viewer. The film challenges its viewers to pay attention and realize the significance of what they saw.
