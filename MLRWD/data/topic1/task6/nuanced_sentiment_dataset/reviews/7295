Having authored several books on the history of the CIA I find my friends in Hollywood sending me scripts about spies. One that was given by Wolfgang Peterson's office many years ago was an early version of The Good Shepherd. The original screenplay was far better then the movie that was produced. The movie as produced ended up with a storyline and screenplay that came off like a bad stew of CIA history and characters. In real life, James Angeleton, the real life person Damon's character is based on, went to England to train under Kim Philby. By killing off the British spy the moviemakers killed off the most interesting story line in the history of the CIA. You see Philby was a longtime Soviet agent in MI6. He betrayed Angleton in 1950's-60's Washington before defecting. After defecting Philby was giving the job of countering Angelton's protection of the CIA. The real story of Angleton and Kim Philby would make a far better film. Philby who defected after decades of being a traitor in MI6 was used by the Russians to target Angleton and a series of phony Russian defectors to convince our people the KGB had no role in killing President Kennedy. But I guess that story is not as interesting as making fun of the white anglo saxon establishment. If you want to watch something close to real and much more entertaining, buy The Spy Who Came in from The Cold or go see the amazing film about the Stasi, "The Lives of Others". For those of you who want to know what really happed about Angleton's era, read THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE CIA. DeNiro should have known better but he must be given credit for getting a movie about the CIA made at all. It really is the toughest sale in Hollywood.
