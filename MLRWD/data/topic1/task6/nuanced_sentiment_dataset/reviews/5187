That's right it doesn't get any more funny than this as far as cartoons go. One of my all time favorite lines is on It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown. Everbody looks to see what candy they got in their trick-or-treat bag and Charlie Brown says "I got a rock."

And then they go out again and when they announce the candy they got in their bag Charlie Brown says this time "I got another rock."

The Great Pumpkin is my all time favorite. I watch it every year I get the chance.

While Charlie Brown is the king of mishaps and everything could go wrong that exist in movies. Chevy Chase is right up there with him. I would rank National Lampoons Christmas Vacation as the best Christmas movie ever but I would rank the Charlie Brown Christmas second. There are plenty of laughs and the tree Charlie Brown chooses doesn't turn out to be so bad after all unlike the tree on Christmas vacation that gives them a handfull of problems.

The Thankgiving one is good also and none of these movies deserve a turkey. This is a great collection and 5 stars says it all. I'm thrilled they are all on DVD now!
