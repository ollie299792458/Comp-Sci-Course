I am delighted to say that I, also, got an accidental copy of the Deluxe Edition before the release date was pushed back.  I am even more delighted to say that "A Fish Called Wanda" has finally gotten the special attention it so greatly deserves.  A masterpiece of hilarity, "Fish" is one of the rare films that managed to be wonderfully mean spirited (in the best way possible), truly subversive for a mainstream movie, and utterly hysterical.  The fact that it was a commerical success amazes me to this day.  Add to that, an Oscar for Kevin Kline--and I have to confess that Hollywood sometimes gets it right.

If you haven't seen the film in a while, you're in for a treat.  It's as good as you remember--smart and clever--it takes it's comedy seriously.  It's fast, furious and takes no prisoners.  And it never dumbs itself down like so many "comedies".

John Cleese is awesome in his best leading performance.  Michael Palin takes a character that would be a PC nightmare in the age of family-friendly homogenization and mines comic gold.  Kevin Kline--let's just say the Academy Award says everything it needs to.  And Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant.  She is so underrated as an actress, but every few years connects so vividly--"Fish", "True Lies" and "Freaky Friday" most noticably.

You know any commentary by Cleese is going to be a winner.  Add the deleted scenes, featurettes, and other Cleese clips--and this is a tremendous find for fans of the movie.  I just hope you enjoy it as much as I did!  KGHarris, 9/06.
