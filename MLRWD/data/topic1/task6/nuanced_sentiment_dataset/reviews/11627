First, I have to say that I have never, ever seen a film with Diane Lane in it.  Ask where I've been, but it's true.  However, I am now inclined to see more of Diane Lane in her other films, because even if others might disagree, Lane was the key in making this film viewable.
Many filmmakers have tried desperatley to duplicate the succsess of the films Basic Instinct and Fatal Attraction.  Unconcsciouly or consciously, this film somehow takes off on that direction but the twist here is that it's the male who plays the part of the seducer, as opposed to the said films which play the female as the femme fatale.  Actually, the oldest story ever told to portray males as the seducers was relayed in the bedtime story Red Riding Hood.  Unfaithful may have taken on that theme.
Olivier Martinez manages to deliver a decent portrayal of the book collector who presumably lives alone in New York City.  Diane Lane's character, the bored (presumably) New Jersey housewife, encounters his character and begins an unexpected affair.  
What interested me and what kept me watching this film is how Diane Lane's character tried to get out of the affair, and the last 30 minutes of the film will have you see Richard Gere's character blowing up Martinez's character into smithereens.  Those were the predictable moments, but you just want to see more and find out what actually IS going to happen to the married couple.
The DVD itself has lots of treats.  If it weren't for the special features, I highly doubt that I would've purchased this DVD.  I loved the interviews with the cast.  See Diane Lane's and see how nervous she is when she talks about playing the part of a cheating wife.
The alternate endings are quite interesting, as is with all other DVDs with the same feature, but personally I liked the ending in the film itself.
I managed to make a review without giving out too much information,  but if you're a die hard Richard Gere fan, then add this to your collection.
