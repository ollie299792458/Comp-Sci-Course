I too bought the Black Hole thinking of my younger years, and watching this film now makes me laugh out loud, as well as see what it COULD have been.  Granted, the film has GREAT SFX... but GREAT SFX does not make a GREAT film.  And it pays MORE than homage to Star Wars. V.I.N.CENT is tin can shaped like R2 and as effeminite as C-3PO. For goodness sakes, the sentry robots have Darth Vader's FACE! A saving grace is the evil robot Maximillian. What a dark, ominous menace it was.  What kills this film when you get down to it is the writing. I have a whole list, but I'll focus on one point as an example....For the entire film, Dr. Reinhardt is a mad genius... but then for seemingly NO reason, towards the end, he tells Kate McCrae "Save me from Maximillian." Where did that come from? It's like the story just made a sharp left into an oak tree. You can't start a new story thread at the end of a film. I didn't even mind the "Fantasia" ending, Dr. Reinhardt and Maximillian togther in a "Dante-esque" hell. But in the end, you are left with a story that had too many things going on at once, rather than it being one thing or another and a movie that isn't really sure of exactly what it wants to be.
