Despite complaints about the depiction of Jesus, I found myself very drawn to the guy, who bravely seemed to know what he needed to do, once he finally had a reason to have to face his truth--there's nothing like having a terminal condition to force one to re-evaluate their reality, their relationships, etc.
I understand people who have come to blame God for their misfortunes-the bible says that a fool perverts his own way, but his heart frets against the Lord. So, it's human nature--when he actually meets Jesus, he'll finally find out that He is the kindest, most loving friend anyone could ever have.
So, I appreciated the process we witnessed of his resoluteness to go his own way in the face of extreme family/fiance' pressure, and of how he seemed to be able to give himself permission to live for himself for once in his life--I wonder how that feels....
And, in the end,this turned out to be the best thing for his fiance', who needed to face her own truth and learn his truth.
I myself am slowing learning that when I do what's right for me, it turns out to be what was right for the other person involved as well. It's still hard to do!
So, people that didn't enjoy the film probably are not thinking about these life issues, and were just looking for entertainment.
