She looks great!  However, I was disappointed.  Would have rather previewed this by renting it before I bought it.  Love the bonus videos on the menu but it is the LEAST Britney and her producers could do for her fans who bought this Bluray.  It didn't bother me that the concert chosen for the Bluray was low live vocals over recorded tracks.  She does that because she has to dance through all of her songs and no artist could sing live and dance like she does without lip syncing.  Not without being deprived of oxygen anyway.  What bothered me is the fact that there was NO spontaneity, or like one reviewer said, no connection with her audience (at least not for this particular live performance).  The scene in which she does bring an "audience member" on stage seems totally preconceived.  I wonder if the guy was really picked at random or whether he was an actor who was hired.  The performance of "If U Seek Amy" was unintentionally laughable because she couldn't keep up with her choreographed moves.  It was rushed and irritating.  The whole show was like watching an elaborate and lengthy video.  It was too dry, rehearsed, and over-choreographed.  She was too standoffish with her audience and if I were a fan who paid for this particular concert, I would have been a little PO'd. Lastly, the concert was way too short to have been totally worth it.  Sorry Britney, either you could have done a better show, or at least chosen one from another city for release.  Still a fan, but the entertaining music videos hardly make this Bluray worth purchasing.
