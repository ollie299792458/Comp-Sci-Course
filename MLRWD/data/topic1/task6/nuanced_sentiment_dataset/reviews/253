Ok watched this today and I am an Amazing spiderman fan from way and know all the characters and the timelines.

The good, pretty good job of trying to fit all those characters into one movie and bring us up to date. Best special effects out of all 3 and did not seem to have the number of visual errors the other 2 had. Kirsten Dunst still makes a great Mary Jane and best character acting to date is Rosemary Harris as May Parker with Jk Simmons as J.Jonah Hameson second.

Bruce Campbell in the restaraunt bit, best cameo of all 3 Spiderman Movies for him.

Thought all the actors did a pretty good job all came off as believable.

Could have been done better. The directing on Toby Maguire as Peter Parker, lines were dilvered great as spiderman, always seems a little off as Peter Parker.

The bad:

Spiderman still has no Webshooters, He's a genius and created is own webmaking fluid, This should have stayed in since the beginning.

The whole "Bad" Peter Parker/Spiderman bit went on way too long don't know if they just needed filler space or what. Could have cut that down to 30 seconds. It was just dumb.

Time line is ..WAYYY out of whack. Actual readers of the comics will vouch for this. It was a little hard buying the Sandman story line the way it was presented in the movie. Granted .Sandman was tough to fit his story into one movie.

and Yes I know all the characters, so following the storyline was not that hard, but most people do not. Lose one villian this move probably ends up being a winner.
