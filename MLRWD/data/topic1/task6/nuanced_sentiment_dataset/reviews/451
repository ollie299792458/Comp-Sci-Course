<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKNHE">Blackboard Jungle</a>  I saw this movie in the theatre when I was in high school, and of course, was impressed with the opening rendition of "Rock Around The Clock" by Bill Haley and His Comets.  It's a classic representation of the 1950s adult view of "Juvenile Delinquents," or incorrigible high school students in an Eastern (New York), mixed ethnic neighborhood, where an all-boy school is taught by teachers who try to reach these boys who seemingly "don't want to learn."  Glenn Ford is the "new teacher on the block" who is at first "shocked" at the behavior of these "hoodlums," but becomes determined to try and reach them somehow.  Sidney Portier is excellent as the apparent leader of Glenn Ford's class who gradually comes to recognize that this teacher really cares about them.  Vic Morrow is the disruptive force in the group who tries to undermine Glenn Ford's efforts to teach this group the value of education.  Kind of a "sleeper" movie of its day, with deeper implications for its time than originally felt by those who saw it.
