This movie; what can i say?  Something went wrong along the way with this movie.  I like the idea of the old school FX, and the acting was alright.  The plot and ending were extremely predictable even for someone who isn't paying much attention.  Maybe a little too obvious and that may be what hurt it most.  You can get up and walk away and still know what is going to happen right down to the Sodium.  Way too much time was spent on explaining who Jack is and the other characters are very shallow, you can even guess who will die and who lives.  I was getting really bored with Jack; how he and his supposed girlfriend even got together is beyond me, and why a new girl in class even likes him is even more mind-boggling.  He is not a sympathetic or even likeable character.  The main demon is barely threatening and by the time you get to it, the movie only has a few minutes left.  Englund did a fine job, and so did everyone given what they were as characters but the overall story was weak.  A main villain who cannot even move is hardly a threat, but at least it had psychic homing tentacles that can follow and grab you from other rooms... i wasn't scared and i kinda wanted to laugh every time i saw the main demon blob even though this isn't really a comedy.  It's cheap, so you can't argue much.  It can be campy fun if you approach it as such - DO NOT TAKE THIS AS A SERIOUS HORROR FILM or a comedy.  More like a campy action film with little action until the last 10 minutes.
