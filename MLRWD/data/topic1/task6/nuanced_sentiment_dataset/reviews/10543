The morons who wrote this tripe know nothing at all about Multiple Personality Disorder. I, myself, with a dear friend who is a multiple, know very little of this tragic disorder, but I'm very sure one small thing the writers/researchers/producers/director NEVER researched. To my knowledge, multiples CANNOT TRANSITION AT WILL without something triggering such a change. I've experienced a few of my friends alters, as "they", and my friend refer to them, and each transition was prefaced with some form of emotional event, which, inevitably, brings my friend to tears, and, within a few minutes, an alter surfaces.

In Tara, the lead character, changes personalities seemingly at will, with nothing triggering such change. Her alters differ like night and day. At one point, she's  a married mother of two (a son and a daughter), conversing with her family. Another scene has her going thru her daughter's closet, dressed and acting like a teenager herself. Still another, as a horny trollop, and ending this torturous half hour garbage as a dyke, who, oddly enough, gets into a fist fight with her daughter's freaked out, Boy George look alike, wacked out, and pierced boyfriend, aided by none other than her geeky looking son. Too weird for me. I'm quite sure my friend will be as offended as I was.
