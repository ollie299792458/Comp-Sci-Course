When this movie was released in the theatres, T2 was the #1 movie. I loved T2 and when someone told me Point Break was a better movie, I thought they were crazy. Now I own both movies and I watch Point Break all the time while T2 gathers dust. Point Break is about a struggle between a rebellious surfer tribe with chief Boudy (Patrick Swazye), who lives life by their own terms, and 'the system' lead byFBI agent Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), who wants them to become productive members of society. You're never quite sure whom to rute for. You'll love to love these bad guys. Packed with action and even some comedy ..., this underrated movie ranks among my all-timefavorites. The beautiful beaches with powerful surf, one of the best chase scenes ever (right up there with Raising Arizona's) and high flying skydiving scenes make this movie perfect for DVD. I'm glad the producers have taken the time to create a quality DVD withwidescreen anamorphic picture and DTS sound. Pick this one up when you get the chance, it's a great movie with excellent replay value.
