The first Ghost in the Shell DVD from Manga Video was an excellent release. But, it lacked one key component: A Japanese language, 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound track. Those of us with surround sound setups who appreciate listening to a movie in its original form were sorely disappointed with the weak stereo track provided.

And now, the GITS 2 Innocence DVD has been released by Dreamworks. And again, key components are missing. Every film released on DVD(that features only the original language soundtrack) in a foreign country MUST have standard, non-hearing impared, subtitling as a minimum. The amount of space consumed on a DVD by subtitling information is miniscule. They could have easily fit both standard and caption subtitles for twenty different languages if they had wished to do so. The english hearing-impared captions for this DVD are massive. On a 16x9 television the gigantic captions take up the full bottom half of the screen. A movie that supports so much visual beauty does not deserve this type of treatment. I expected Dreamworks to take better care of such a great film. They allowed a simple omission to mar a fantastic experience. I truly regret not catching this in theaters when I had the chance.
