I didn't know there was such a thing as b-type cartoons but this one is definitely b-rated. If you know that going in, it's actually quite funny to see bad acting extended to cartoon characters. Lot's of blood and guts in minute sepia tone and of course a gratuitous boob shot (or two, or six) if you're into that.

Basic story: man unearths something he shouldn't have, it transforms him into an evil psycho who wants to control the universe or at least kill everyone in it who isn't compliant. There's also the added perk of living forever. He attacks a friendly planet kidnapping a teacher whose only surviving relative is a warrior woman with attitude and determination of her own. A big mistake he regrets repeatedly until the end.

What's good about it? The graphics are pretty good although the body movements are a bit stifled at times. I actually prefer the vibrancy of Titan A. E. If you're into metal music you'll enjoy the tracks too.

I have never seen the first movie so I don't have it to compare it to. Now that I've watched this one right through I wouldn't waste my time watching it again.
