No movie that I've seen in the last quarter century haunts me quite like Gattaca. I love this movie to the point where it actually brings me to tears just by thinking about it sometimes. Out of curiosity, I had to check out the 1- and 2-star reviews.

The details of the plot have been well-covered by other reviews, so I won't go into that here. There is a consistent theme I see in the reviews: people who rate Gattaca low are focused on the discriminatory society portrayed in the film. People who rate Gattaca high are more interested in how Vincent busts his ass to fight for the life he wants to lead in spite of that society.

I'm solidly in the second camp. This movie is about making your own life. This movie is about never giving up. This movie is about sacrificing and working hard for what matters to you. This is a movie about how expectations can be wrong, about how we're more than our genes, about entitlement and despair, about how you'll take that one chance in a thousand when it's your dream on the line. This is what the 5-star reviewers see in the film. The 1-stars just see it as a film about discrimination and get bored.
