In this stirring story, Eric Liddel prevails because of his commitment to the God whom he believes has given him an extraordinary talent. The movie parallels Liddel and Harold Abrahams, a Jewish runner, who are set to race for England in the Paris Olympics. We find two incredibly different individuals protrayed in this film. Liddel runs for God and is quick to give Him the glory for his accomplishmnets. Abrahams runs to prove a point to the prejudice around him and perhaps to prove to himself that he can be a champion.  In Eric Liddel's emotional struggle we are stirred with emotion as we watch him decide to give up worldly fame for Heavenly gain. His story inspires the watcher to prioritize his/her life and stand for what is right even if that means not realizing all of your dreams.  In the end it is Liddel who is satisfied with his life as Abrahams finds that even as a champion there is still something missing in his life. This is a deep movie and some people are not able to take the time that the movie requires to think. If you do not take the opportunity to absorb this movie for all it is worth you have truly missed out on one of the most important stories of modern faith.
