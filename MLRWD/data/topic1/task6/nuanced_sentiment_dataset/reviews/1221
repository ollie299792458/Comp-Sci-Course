'Jurassic Park' is a masterpiece, even today. I never get sick of watching this movie. In fact, I was watching it last night! Though they could've added more features to this DVD (there are way more features to the 'Jurassic Park III' DVD), just for the movie is well-worth the price! This movie is about two scientists who specialize in peleontology, are taken to this island amusement park designed by a wealthy business man to test it and see if it will work out for the public. This amusement park is unlike any other, for it is an amusement park of real-life dinosaurs which were re-created by top scientists who discovered a way to bring dinosaurs back to life. The theme park is called Jurassic Park, and once on the island, they meet a top mathemetician and the wealthy business man's two young grandchildren who come along for the trip, too. When someone suddenly shuts down the security on the island, things start heating up and the T-Rex gets loose! Now the humans are on a wild chase to get off the island alive before they are all eaten by the dinosaurs. This movie rocks and the special effects are just stunning and simply spectacular. The plot is really good and there's even some humor. The whole cast from Sam Neill to Samuel L. Jackson is absolutely superb. This is one of my favorite Speilberg films ever. The directing and filmmaking are top-notch. Some of the best special effects of the early '90s are featured in this movie. If you have not yet seen 'Jurassic Park', then I strongly recommend it - the movie never loses your interest! And if you liked 'Jurassic Park', then I also strongly recommend 'The Lost World' and 'Jurassic Park III', which are just as amazing and awesome as the first!
