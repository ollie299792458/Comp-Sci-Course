(Kwankin, maybe?)  This movie is electric.  Especially Stamp.  Terrence Stamp gives the best performance of the year.  He alone is worth the rent (Christ, the scene where he pays the guys in the warehouse a second visit  is worth the rent, classic).  He's flawlessly entertaining.  This film also  had the best editing.  Amazing how Soderbergh spliced so many scenes  together with dialogue from various scenes in the movie going back and  forth, and it all made perfect sense.  I especially loved how throughout  the movie, you assume the shot of him on the plane is from his ride to  America, but then you find that it's him on the plane home, recollecting  his vacation (hope I'm not ruining this for anyone).  This film reminded me  a great deal of John Boorman's Point Blank.  Both are films about men on  missions of revenge, thinking of nothing else.  Both had some hilariously  violent scenes.  Both were nearly overlooked completely.  And like Point  Blank, to understand the ending, you're going to have to figure out what's  going through our heroes head.
