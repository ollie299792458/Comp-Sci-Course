I'll refrain from surveying the plot of "Mystery Men" for the sake of space; rest assured that this movie is both smart and funny in ways that all action, super-hero fans will be able to appreciate.  Instead, I'd  rather focus on the DVD presentation of the movie for those of you  wondering if the title is worth the purchase.
As a DVD, the titlehas been  fairly well mastered.  While the menus are non-animated and fairly static,  the DVD itself boasts quite a few enhancements over typical non-special  edition DVDs.  The making-of featurette is lengthy and interesting, and the  feature commentary through the movie is very informative.
While ten  deleted scenes are included on the DVD, they are (unfortunately) strung  together in one long track.  The inability to skip to different deleted  scenes is somewhat frustrating.  I would suggest, however, that one listens  to the feature-length director's commentary prior to viewing the deleted  scenes.  The commentary adds useful background and makes the scenes much  more interesting.  Unfortunately, the alternate ending that was shot for  the movie was not included in the deleted scenes.
In all, the DVD is one  of the better presentations out there.  True to Universal form, it is  complemented with plenty of special features, and at its price point is a  great buy for fans of the movie.  It would have been nice to have a few  more bells and whistles, however to make the DVD seem more complete and not  as thrown together (animated menus, divided deleted scenes, etc).
