Legally Blond (2001) has it all.  It has humor, romance, and the determination for Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) to win back the love of her life, Warner Huntington III(Matthew Davis).  This hilarious comedy in color is directed by Robert Luketic at the MGM/Ua Studio and has a running time of 96 minutes.  Elle is expecting for Warner to propose to her, but instead he dumps his Pooh Bear because she is "too blond."  He leaves California and heads to Harvard Law School where hereunites with an old prep school sweetheart.  Elle is determined to win the love of her life back, so uses her resources and amazingly enough gets accepted to Harvard.  She travels to Harvard with one thing on her mind, Warner.  However, law school is not quite what she had in mind, it's not like her life back in California where she was president of her sorority and a Hawaiian Tropic Girl.  Elle fights the battle of her life for herself and blonds everywhere and most of all, for her guy.  This movie is funny with a bit of a corny blend, but is definitely worth watching although not receiving any awards or nominations.  A soundtrack is also available.
