Horror movies can be categorized into two camps:  original and formulatic/predictable.  The former are groundbreaking, such as "Psycho" or the 1st "Nightmare on Elm St."  The latter can best be illustrated by films like "I Know What You Did Last Summer."  
"The Glass House" falls into the latter category.  But you know what's funny?  After viewing a film that is formulatic/predictable, many movie goers swear up and down that they will never watch such a "stupid and predictable" movie again.  But...we keep coming back for more of the same.
Yes, "The Glass House" is predictable.  Yes, it becomes almost a parody of what its early scenes tried to be.  However, there were some tense moments created by the director, and some creepy acting by Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Diane Lane.  
My wife and I had fun watching it because of the infrequent tense moments and the stereotypical script.  However, I wish that amazon.com would incorporate 1/2 star ratings, because this movie was more of a 2 1/2 star flick than a 3 star flick.
