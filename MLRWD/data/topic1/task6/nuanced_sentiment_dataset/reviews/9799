This is, without a doubt, one of the dumbest and worst movies I have ever seen.  Judd (a lonely, divorced woman somewhere in the southwest) is attracted to a drifter (Michael Shannon) who is convinced that the government "bugged him" with aphids that have the ability to multiply and seemingly infect other human beings.  After a night of sex, we are led to believe the Judd becomes "affected" with Shannon's paranoid images and philosophy.  Her ex-husband (Connick, Jr.) is no help and when a doctor tries to intervene and help Shannon with his delusions he stabs the doctor to death.

That brings us to the ending.  After much bantering and ranting, Judd and Shannon douse themselves with gasoline and set themselves on fire after some worthless diatribe about aphids, mother aphids, host aphids, worker aphids and some other mindless stupidity after that.

It's no wonder that Amazon has copies that have been seen and offered at ONE CENT.  Believe me, don't buy this worthless, totally illogical and ill-conceived movie and save yourself the penny (plus postage and handling).

I saw it on TMC and spared the expense. Apparently Judd and Connick need some dough...or else they would not have made such a worthless pile of junk.
