Good day, eh? and welcome to my review.  "Strange Brew" is best described as a Canadian version of Hamlet with beer and a happy ending.  (The Brewery is even named "Elsinore" for crying out loud.)  Lynne Griffin plays Pam Elsinore, the Hamlet character, who is helped by the indefatigable Doug and Bob Mackenzie (Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis) against the evil Dr. B. M. Smith played by Max von Sydow (I don't know how they got Max von Sydow other than he cashed the check and it cleared) and his bumbling minion, Pam's uncle Claude Elsinore, well played by Paul Dooley ("Breaking Away, the voice of 'Sarge' in "Cars").  Brewmeister Smith is planning to use beer he has chemically altered to control peoples' minds in order to take over the world and it is up to Pam, her love interest, former hockey star Jean LaRose (Angus MacInnes), and Doug and Bob to stop him.  In the end, the Mackenzies manage to save the day and even find a way to safely dispose of the altered beer.

Even after all these years, the MacKenzies are still hilarious.  The Mackenzie characters, portraying all the negative Canadian stereotypes (beer drinking, toque wearing, back bacon eating), were created by native Canadians Moranis and Thomas to protest Canadian content laws on Canadian Television and the two play their characters to the hilt.  "Strange Brew" has so many wacky and madcap scenes and Thomas and Moranis are over the top as Doug and Bob, it is hard to choose a favorite scene.  Given that, I would have to say my  favorite line is when Bob and Pam are trapped in a rapidly filling beer tank, "My brother and I used to say that drowning in beer was like Heaven, eh?  Now he's not here and I've got two soakers . . . this isn't Heaven, this sucks!"

So now, like, all you hosers need to get this movie, eh?  Otherwise you knobs can take off, eh?!
