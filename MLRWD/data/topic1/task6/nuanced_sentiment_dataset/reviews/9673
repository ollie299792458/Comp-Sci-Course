The animation is great no doubt about that. The story is faithful to the novel no complaint there. Boy it was much more scary. The scene with Jacob Marley's ghost is so graphic with his mouth cracking open and this horrid black tongue hanging out. I am an adult and it was to scary and it was gross. I had to look away. To top it off I did fall asleep that never happens in the Polar Express. So I have mixed emotions.

Also when you get a DVD they usually have the picture of the cover on the DVD, no so this is the plain gray you get when you rent from a place like Netfix. Made it feel like I was getting a discount cut down copy. Not that it totally matters but with all things considered it was one more disappointment.

The best part is the bonus material on how it was made and the reactions of the actors. I wanted this to be a 5 star but it just is not and I sure wouldn't show it to children under 10 years old. This is the stuff of nightmares. I'll stick with the original B & W version<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SR0DDE">A Christmas Carol (Ultimate Collector's Edition)(B/W & Color)</a> and the Muppets Christmas Carol which I love.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ATQYT2">The Muppet Christmas Carol - Kermit's 50th Anniversary Edition</a>
