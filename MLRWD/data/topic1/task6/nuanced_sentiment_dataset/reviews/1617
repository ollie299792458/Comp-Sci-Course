The winning formula in the movies wins fans, fame, and to a certain degree respect too. That formula though if pushed out with the same type of humor and feel does and eventually gets old. The recent success of the "Frat Pack" is an example of this as each movie after the success of "Old School" is watered down version filled with the same "milked' formula. Still, though I will be lying if I said that the Frat Pack is not without good laughs still...it's just getting a little old and predictable.

Friends and co-workers John and Jeremy are marriage arbitrators that work hard and reward themselves with the wedding crashing scene. Both have very planned out and effective rules that result in many successful outings. Their game is good, but the "X" factor (love) bites one of them as John falls for a politician's daughter and their usual routine turns into a messy and funny situation. Jeremy assumes the role as the ultimate wing-man and endures physical and emotional aches as John tries to win his target over.

The tone of this movie is inconsistent as it turns quite sweet and sincere in the middle and ends pretty predictably and ridiculous in the end. The Will Ferrell cameo especially was unnecessary as it provided the most desperate attempt for cheap laughs. The movie though was still funny, but the aforementioned winning formula is fizzing.
