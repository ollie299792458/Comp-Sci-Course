The CYCLOPS in The Schneer/Harryhausen/Juran/Hermann
"SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD" (the first one we meet)
is and always will be the best ever monster of all movies.
That Ray H. could wring such a range of emotion and character out of his creation
(and that working solo - no ILM in those Dynamation Days of Yore!)
is a testimony to his talent, determination and genius.
That this monster should appear early in the long line of COLOR
movie monsters makes it a prototype as well as an archetype.
Mark well: the balance in the thing's WALK; the body language in the TALK; the cocking of the HEAD; the licking and sneering of the LIPS; the blinking and staring of THE EYE! I can only testify to the power of this monster on (1) the big screen - I saw "Sinbad" several times as an eight-year-old at the theater - and (2) on VHS - my copy has been shared with literally DOZENS of kids (all under ten!) on many a television set. {{BUT I promise: if and when I purchase a DVD player, it will be, first of all, to see the AMAZON DVD of "7th"!}}
Finally, the pathos elicited in the cyclops in its coveting of the treasure (the lamp in particular) and in its inglorious death
combine to top KING KONG and Frankenstein's monster in the INhuman, truly unique and 'monsteriffic' behavior department.
There will never be another like the cyclops of Colossa!
PAEANS, homage and KUDOS to those who brought CYCLOPS to the screen and to our eyes, ears, and hearts!
