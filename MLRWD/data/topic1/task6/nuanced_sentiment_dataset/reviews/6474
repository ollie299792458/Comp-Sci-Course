This is the FUNNIEST MOVIE I'VE SEEN IN MY LIFE.  (And I've been around since the ACTUAL 1970's.  And, I'm a MOVIE COLLECTOR.)  There are a LOT of funny movies out there, and a lot of different kinds of comedy that I like, dating back to classics from the 1930's; but for ME, this is THE BEST OF THE BEST.

Simply put, watch the trailer, which you can find either on youtube, or right here on Amazon, on the main Black Dynamite DVD product page.  Just below the product image of the DVD product, is a small video window with a trailer.  The movie is JUST LIKE THE TRAILER.  If you love the trailer, you'll love the movie.  I don't know HOW they made the ENTIRE MOVIE every bit as good as the trailer, but they did! (usually the trailer is always "the best parts of the movie" - not here!).

Most importantly, BOTH the main actor, AND the guy who did the soundtrack, have an obvious un-deniable LOVE for what they were doing.  It REALLY COMES THROUGH.  You can tell they THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND, and LOVE, this style of movie, and the classic 1960s-70s style of vintage soul music.  This entire movie was actually the brainchild of the lead actor, Michael Jai White, who himself is an avid Blaxploitation movie collector, who would invite friends over for parties where they'd watch old Blaxploitation films - then he started Dressing The Part in '70s suits & the afro wig - and it grew from there.

Black Dynamite is a real LABOR OF LOVE, and it's FROM THE HEART... and it's DY-NO-MITE!!  (Once you see the movie, you'll want to pick up the soundtrack album by multi-instrumentalist Adrian Younge, too!)
