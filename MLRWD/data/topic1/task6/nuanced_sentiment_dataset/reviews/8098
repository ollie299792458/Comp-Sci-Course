The Bounty is a well told tale with a strong cast - including four future Oscar winners no less - Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs), Gibson (Producing and Directing "Braveheart"), Liam Neeson (Schindler's List), and two-timer Daniel Day-Lewis (My Left Foot and There Will Be Blood).  Don't forget to include veteran actor, and already an Oscar winner, Sir Laurence (Hamlet) into the mix.  I compare this version easily with Brando's version, as that one had great actors like Trevor Howard and Richard Harris.  Both Gibson and Brando showed a side of Fletcher that was confused between romance and duty.  These are certainly two factors that led to his decision to mutiny. Gibson was a great actor in his younger days, and this movie showed that the New York born Aussie could hold his own after making "alternative" cult classics like Mad Max.  Hopkins portrayal of Bligh exceeds that of Richard Harris.  Hopkins shows a side of empathy, while remaining by the book, and seemingly ruthless - hard to do.

Now, that being said - lets not forget the original screen version of 1935.  This starred Clark Gable (Oscar Winner-1934) and Charles Laughton (Oscar Winner - 1933) as Fletcher and Bligh respectively.  The cast also includes Franchot Tone' in the cast.  It remains the only film to have garnered three Best Actor Nominations - for the same film - in the same year.  And yes, I still think the 1935 version is best.

PS:  I wasn't born until 1968.
