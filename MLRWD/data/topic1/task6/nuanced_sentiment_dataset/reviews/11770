Major Winchester:Surely you jest?

  Col. Baldwin:Surely You GO!
  And go he did to the 4077th to replace stateside-bound Lt. Col. Burns(that's the Army for you, go on leave get bombed out of your skull and jump in a Korean hot tub with Brig. Gen and Mrs. Kester, and you will be promoted and sent stateside!)who provided plenty of ammo for Hawkeye, Trapper, and B.J.
  Season 6 opens up much like season 5 with a special 1 hour episode involving new M*A*S*H member Winchester. Winchester was a delight skillfully played(with fake blue-blood accent) by David Ogden Stiers. Season 6(really beginning with season 5) and on are often belted with reviews about how preachy, and sentimental the episodes became which is true. It was, probably, a fresh approach by the producers and writers to be different and contrast the often irreverant nature of the show when Col. Blake was at the helm. One of the episodes that demonstrates this is "Fallen Idol". This episode showed other sides to the character of Pierce as well as Radar. "Tea and Empathy" was always one of my favorites from this season. Corporal's confession to Mulcahy is a riot:
Father:Anything else my son?
Corporal:Let's see, drinking, fighting, fraternizing, NOPE that's it!
