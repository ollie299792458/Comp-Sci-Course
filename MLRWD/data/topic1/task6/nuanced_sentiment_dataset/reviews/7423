If I had to choose my favorite character in this film it would definitely be Ruby (Renee Zellweger). From the moment Ruby appears and rescues Ada (Nicole Kidman) from an aggressive rooster, cranks his head around until you hear a squawk as his neck breaks, to the end of the movie, Ruby is a delight, and was a great part of what made this film so terrific.  Ada was the perfect contrast to Ruby's take-charge, can-do attitude.  I've read some criticism of Jude Law's performance, but I thought his "Inman" worked out quite well, as did the supporting actors such as Ruby's father and his friends.  Of course there are "bad guys" in the story, but since good guys usually prevail in a good story, their skulduggery is dealt with in the end.

While this movie is characterized as a Civil War movie, there's very little of the war in it.  A scene or two of what I believe was the Battle of the Crater at Petersburg, is all I recall.  Other than that, the violence is pretty much confined to a few short scenes.  Most of the story is about the woman left behind and how Ada and Ruby survived a difficult time period in our national history.  Both women have their victories. For Ruby, it is a reunion with the father who abandoned her as a child; for Ada it is the eventual return of the man she loves.  Since I'm one who loves happy endings, this story/film ended in a way not expected, and not as happy perhaps as it might have been.  Yet the final scenes were about love, family, friendship, children and acceptance. For Ada, Inman will be always young, strong, and forever protecting her. The sadness passes, memories are cherished, and life is good.
