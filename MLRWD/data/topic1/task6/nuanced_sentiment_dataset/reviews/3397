What a great DVD this is. I'll say it every time I review a WWE DVD. The WWE really hits the mark with their DVD releases. The Four Horsemen DVD is no exception. Between this and the Ric Flair DVD set, you should have more than enough on a great era of wrestling.

The documentary on this DVD is the best, right up there with the ECW and Hulk Rules DVD's. Ric Flair speaks so honestly and candidly on thoughts of the various incarnations of the 4 Horsemen. I liked hearing what he had to say on Luger, Roma, and Bischoff, worth the price alone.

The other thing I liked was hearing from Barry Windham, I always enjoyed his work. He was a Florida boy, when I used to live there. It was great to hear what he had to say, sad to see him get so heavy.

Arn Anderson, and Tully were interesting. I was such a big fan of the horsemen back in the day, to go down memory lane and hear them talk about what was happening behind the scenes was awesome. I haven't gotten to the second disc yet, but I can already say I would have somehow liked to see more Barry Windham.

Great DVD, especially if you were a fan at the time. WWE hit another one out of the park.
