The premise of this flick is pretty simple.  Way back when, a Native American had cursed a turkey and unleashed it on the pilgrims.  Reanimated by an unfortunately aimed stream of dog wee-wee, the homicidal turkey resumes his rampage after spending a few centuries in the ground.  Enter the five college kids driving home together for Thanksgiving break who happened to have vehicle issues.  Wouldn't you know it?  They end up being hunted down by the turkey.  Can they stop the turkey before it kills them all?  Will the turkey take over the entire world?  Do vertical stripes make people  appear slimmer?  Does anyone care?

Thankskilling is not a horror movie, horror-comedy, or any other horror-related subgenre.  It's really set up as a full on comedy the results of which aren't very funny, and mainly comprised of superficial and sometimes offensive silliness.  The enjoyable aspect of this is that while watching the movie it's obvious how much fun the performers and crew are having making Thankskilling despite the purposeful ridiculousness of the material.  This alone is at least strangely, if not potently, entertaining.

The film's cast is largely comprised of young folks who'd had either zero, very little, or exclusively pornographic acting experience prior to shooting Thankskilling.  The results are predictably bad, but clearly there were no Oscar aspirations involved in the making of this film.  The characters are all generic slasher archetypes.  There's the jock, the slut, the nerd, the regular guy (or large, but lovable redneck in this case) and the good girl.  These archetypes are alluded to as such, but that's where the self-aware movie conceit stops, leaving several potential jokes to die on the vine.
