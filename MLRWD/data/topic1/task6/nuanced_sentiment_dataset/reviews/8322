It is bloody and gruesome to the point of boring because its story is almost nonexistent. Great deal of time is spent on explaining the first two saws, which was a bad idea because they didn't need to be explained in detail, and the "clarifications" only made them lame and less believable. Another good chunk of precious movie time is spent on pointless cruelty.

Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) attempts to explain his actions with logical "rules" and sense of justice, but there is neither logic nor justice in what he does. For example, Jigsaw's sense of correctness compels him to take care of people's feelings (like forgiveness and letting go) and to make sure their feelings are proper, but all get tortured and most get killed during the honorable venture.

Jigsaw is terminally ill and unable to tinker with elaborate torturing and killing machines and to do the abductions himself; so we learn it's his rather scrawny girlfriend Amanda (Shawnee Smith) who did all the brute work for him while wearing a pig's head. Yeah, right ...

If there is Saw IV - I hope there isn't - then probably Jeff (Angus Macfayden) is going to take over Jigsaw's workshop and keep correcting people's improper feelings.
