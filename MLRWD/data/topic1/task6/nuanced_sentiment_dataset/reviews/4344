When it comes to adult-themed moralistic storytelling, Adrian Lyne is the master.  He strips out the schlockiness of Fatal Attraction and provides us with a morality tale of what adultery does to the betrayer, betrayed and the lover.  Yes, as Amazon points out, the movie does turn partially predictable, but that doesn't detract from its power.  The theme of adultery and its consequences is timeless.  C.f. 2 Sam. 11:2-17.

I was curious to see what my reactions and impressions would be watching this film after finding out about my wife's affair, having seen it once before the affair, and a second time just recently.  It rings as true now as it did before my wife's infidelity, but has become even more poignant and at times difficult to bear.  But who said movies were only supposed to make you feel good?

"There are no mistakes.  There's what you do, and what you don't do" Oliver Martinez' Paul Martel says at one point.  Mr. Lyne does his best to show that Paul's carefree, existential, valueless philosophy is wrong.  Mr. Lyne succeeds.  Mistakes exist, as do the consequences for them.
