Watch the 1988 Biography "Imagine: John Lennon" instead of this. This is an oversimplification, if not revisionist history. There are some interesting parts showing the evidence of the Nixon administration's harassment of Lennon which is amazing to fathom. But the politicking of the film itself and the grand whitewash of the years after 1972 weaken this film------The fact that Lennon pretty much severed his radical ties after 1972-----the artistic/commercial failure of the "Sometime in NYC" album-----coupled with the bad reviews for his live in NYC concert-----which resulted in a slow long lapse into the "lost weekend" for the better part of two years----this  is conveniently omitted. He is very human and I'm not gonna fault him for it----he owned up to it and it's part of what made him a great artist. I agree with May Pang: "The Lost Weekend" wasn't so lost. There was a lot of musical activity, but not much political activity. {I'd much rather listen to the boozy "Walls & Bridges" album than the chic-political sloganeering of "Sometime in NYC"------"Give Peace a Chance" and "Imagine" were so effective I guess I can't blame him for trying}. I admire Lennon as a musician and also as a thinker but I think his overtly political work in 1972 represents the nadir of his artistry. He seemed much more well-rounded in his final interviews-----transcending politics..............
