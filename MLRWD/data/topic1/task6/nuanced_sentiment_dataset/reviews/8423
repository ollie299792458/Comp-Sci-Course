OK, let's get this straight right up front: I love Fantastic Planet.  It's a fantastic film (yes, I meant to do that).  I was elated to see the DVD arrive at my door.  And oh, hurray!  Widescreen!  Finally I can watch it in widescreen!
So I go to watch it in Laloux's preferred version (English, yes - and the flat emotionless voices in the English version are indeed intentional and not "bad acting" for the inhuman Trogs), and oops, the subtitles are still on.  And, annoyingly, they are not on the bottom black bar but right over the artwork.  I go to turn them off, and - lo and behold - they are already off!  The only film print transferred for this DVD has the subtitles on RIGHT OVER THE PICTURE.  I've seen videotapes of FP that did better than that (English, no subtitles).
The inexcusable laziness of those overlooking the transfer covers up some of the richest art in French animation.  It's appalling.  I can't even tell you how mad I was when I saw it.  All they had to do was do a transfer without subtitles, and have them re-entered as an optional subtitle display (like every other DVD I've seen or owned!).
Am I too picky?  Perhaps.  My other options?  Just one right now: Just live with this less-than-completist edition of one of my favorite movies.
Guess I'll have to wait and pay... for the Criterion edition...
Not that that'll ever hit the shelves.
