"Heartbreak ridge," is one of those movies that I think turned into an unintentional recruiting movie.  First off, for those true devil dogs, like me, you all recognize Eastwood's character of GySgt Highway as the epitomy of what Chesty Puller described as a Marine.  How many marines have encountered Gunnys, Sergeant Majors, and First Sergeants that held the same attitude and mystique that Gunny Highway had?  I mean, first off, a combat veterean who tells a POG (Marines will know that term) officer to go "F" himself, is the kind of NCO we wanted to follow.  I know that when I first watched this movie, it made me want to join (which I did) and be just like Gunny Highway (which I didn't).  For the people who see this movie and say it portrays the Corps in a negative light, go live with a Marine infantry unit, and you'll see how realistic it is.  It may not be the best Marine Corps story (I save that for Jarhead), but its one of the best out there, better than Full Metal Jacket.  I reccomend that all 0311 Marines, and really, any Marine, should add this to their "Must- Own" collection.
