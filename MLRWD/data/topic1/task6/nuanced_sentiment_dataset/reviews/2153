I did have my hopes up for this movie as the first one rocked! I was disappointed because they basically used the same script, which was somewhat expected as I heard they were going to keep it similar by going by the old saying, "if it aint broke, don't fix it".  With that said, the movie was very VERY predictable. A lot of the same scenes such as waking up in a hotel room not remembering anything, another missing buddy, another wedding they're late for, another song by Stew, another bad guy who holds their friend hostage, another SOS call to Doug's wife at the beginning and end, another late entrance to the wedding, another Asian full frontal, I could go on and on. They made poor Alan's jokes and humor over the top to the point where they weren't really that funny which is sad since Alan is probably the best character.

It's almost like the original creators were in a big hurry to make No.2 that they just made the exact same movie in a different location. I KNOW it's a Part II, but it's like a re-make of the first one. It pissed me off that this movie was put off from being sold on DVD for so long like it's actually going to be worth the wait and anticipation. Huge FAIL. I heard Smurfs kicked ass compared to this.
