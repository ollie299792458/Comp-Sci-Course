As is to be expected, the Hollywood tycoons have done it again. Usually, I am smart enoughto figure when they may pull a stunt like this but this time I was not. I bought "Electra" and then learned that a special edition would be forthcoming... and it would also be an unrated edition. So, the question came up in my mind as to if I should go ahead and buy this "extended" cut and after reading what other people had to say abut it, I came to the conclusion of "no."
Don't get me wrong, the movie Electra was decent fare. I enjoyed watching Jennifer Garner face off against some intersting, yet underdeveloped, bad guys. The special effects were pretty cool(although the sheets in the foyer scene was a bit much for me to accept beyond CGI fakeness) and I think that the story was really not all that bad. This hero was a conflicted one... torn between doing bad things for money to people who actually deserved their fates and actually doing some good by standing up against those who would normally hire her. But...
Why do Hollywood execs feel the need to take more money from fans who bought the movie because they liked it so much. I did enjoy it... but let me tell you... not enough to buy it twice. This has become a sad money stealing trend... releasing films and then shortly after cutting a "diectors cut" or "special edition". Sin City is a good example... a new edition is set to be released soon... Or even LOTR which now has three different variations to it.
Why can't these "Expanded" or "Unrated" editions be made available right away? Or... maybe on the DVD released there should be a sticker that says "Special Edition forthcomming". Something! It makes me hate buying DVD's... and it sort of offers insight (I'm still not justifying it just yet) into the illegal pirating of films.
