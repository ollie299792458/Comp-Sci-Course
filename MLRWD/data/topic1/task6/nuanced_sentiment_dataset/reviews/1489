This ranks with "The Resurrected" as one of the most excellent and lovingly produced Lovecraftian movie treatments I have come across.  There is peerless handling of dramatic tension, with that artful, classically Lovecraftian juxtaposition of "normalcy" and the trans-physical (I would not use supernatural in the context of Lovecraft works) which goes to show that the director has a sincere and heartfelt appreciation of the genre known as Cthlhu Mythos.  A product of love by a director who knows his stuff.  Everything a Lovecraft fan expects is here:-  the innocent visitor (Sandra Dee), the creepy but apparently normal village weirdo (played with great restraint and deadly effectiveness by Dean Stockwell), your well-meaning smalltown doctor, overtones of in-breeding, incest, horrific genetic mixture with outer-dimensional monsters, ancient books of unspeakable mysteries (I would not use the word 'evils' in a Lovecraftian context) written by long-lost wizards, the secret library, the mysterious big mansion, strange stone menhirs and open-air sacrificial temples from aeons-past. Its ALL here!!  Even if you are not a Lovecraftian fan you would enjoy this.  Well worth it, go for it!!
