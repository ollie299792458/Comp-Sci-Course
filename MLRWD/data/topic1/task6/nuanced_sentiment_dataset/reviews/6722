This movie had an interesting flip to it that took me by surprise.  I was expecting a more authentic medieval time period movie, and found it to be more of a comedy.  So, I am not sure if I was disappointed at first or not.  Perhaps, if I had read beforehand what to expect, I may have liked it better than I did.  I found myself groaning about the 70's pop and rock music used throughout the soundtrack.  Were they trying to save money by not formulating fresh and new music? (which could have been awesome), or were they trying to be funny and different??  I am not sure.  The costumes were not time period authentic either, but did that matter?  I suppose not.  HOWEVER, The storyline was fun and had the things I like in a movie...some romance, some action, a good looking main man (and woman...for the guys)...and to my surprise alot of unexpected humor.  I enjoyed the characters, and thought they worked well together.  I liked the action scenes, they were not "bloody" graphic, but they still packed a punch.  I liked the cleanliness of the language, (a welcome change to some of today's movies, which can go overboard with vulgar language).  Just so you know what to expect for your kidsake, there was a few "bare butt" scenes, by one of the men (not Heath's).  OKAY, So I groaned in disbelief a few times as to the direction they went on some things, I did get a few good laughs and of course some fun entertainment for my money.  I just wouldn't say it was the best film I have ever seen, just a fun movie.  If that is what you like...you will enjoy this movie...I did...I just won't buy the soundtrack :).
