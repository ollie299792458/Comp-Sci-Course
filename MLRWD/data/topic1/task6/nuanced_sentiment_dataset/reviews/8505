This review is not going to be in the featured review at all, in fact, this isnt a review but more of a plea...

The plot of this movie is Robbin Williams charater is a "cutter" and makes memory filmes from the good times of that persons life.  And there is this cutter code, and williams unknowingly breaks it and then is chased down...  Ok now to my opinion.

This is one of the most depressing movies ever!!  I was waiting for somthing good to happen to Robin Williams (and it does... once)  but it all comes apart.

I just finised watching this and I will admit, it is very well done, and really makes you think about what you will be remembered for, but I really dont think the retrospection will be worth any sort of happiness that this will suck away.

It is a good movie, but makes you want to jump face first into a giant fan like device that will destroy the depression this film brings on...  Ok the rant is over, good movie, good plot, could have used some sort of closure and not some sort of ending that makes you want to question everything you know. :)
