Now, I am a very big fan of the film "Nosferatu" (1922), and that is the reason I wanted to see this.  I was VERY dissapointed.  The acting was either over-exagerated (Malkovitch), whiny (The chick that played Greta Schroeder, I forget her name), annoying and totaly unlike the actors in the real film "Nosferatu" (Defoe), or just plain stiff and in-the-background.  Now, it was interesting enough seeing the scenes from the movie with new actors and in colour, but they were still unfaithful, rigid, and just pathetic.  Did ANY member of the cast or crew watch "Nosferatu" (1922) besides the writer?!?!?  And speaking of the writing, it's pretty danged tin-pan-alley!  Also, Defoe does NOT act like Max Schreck AT ALL.  He's WAY too sudden and murderous in his movements.  Schreck was slow, stiff, spidery, and creepy.  Defoe was just like "SNARL!!!" &lt;twitch> &lt;twitch>!  Now, the idea of making a movie about the making of Nosferatu except that Schreck is a vampire IS A PRETTY COOL IDEA.  Really.  But it is just executed SO POORLY in this movie.  Well, I'll give this movie two stars simply because it really wasn't all that terrible, but it just has one too many a gaping hole in it.  Also, it's about a relativley obscure movie, so, I congratulate it for that.
