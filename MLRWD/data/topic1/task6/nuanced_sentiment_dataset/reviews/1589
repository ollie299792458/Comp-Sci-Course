Bloodsport is a true martial arts classic. Any serious martial arts movie fan has seen this film at least once. I was 7 years old when it came out in theaters, and when I watch it today I get that nostalgic feeling that I love. The movie has a dash of everything: action, comedy, romance, and memorable one-liners...typical of 80's films.  
The movie just oozes 80's. First of all, the music is AWESOME. Songs like "Fight to Survive" and "On My Own Alone" go down as true 80's classics.  I love the scene where Van Damme is playing Karate Champ...a game that has been extinct longer than the dinosaurs. 
The scenery and backdrop of the movie is great. You really get that "Hong Kong" feeling when watching this movie, and I love the scenes filmed within the dark, narrow corridors. The fight scenes are decently choreographed, and some of the fighters are pretty cool, especially Paco, the dirty kickboxer. Of course he is nothing compared to Chong Li, the main villain. He beats heads AND flexes his pecs. 
Bottom line...if you watch this movie with a light heart you will enjoy it. Just don't expect anything too serious and it is entertaining as hell. I had been waiting for this DVD release for a long time, and I recommend it.
