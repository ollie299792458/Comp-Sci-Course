I'm just getting back into Doctor Who courtesy of my three year old daughter who absolutely loves it. The first episode I really remember seeing was the Planet of the Spiders where Pertwee changed into Baker. Consequently, Tom Baker remains my firm favorite because he was really "my" Doctor Who.
There was a fair amount of disappointment with the Five Doctors among my fellow 13 year olds when it came on British TV. Personally, I would have held off production once I learned Tom Baker wasn't available. The stand-in for Hartnell does a fantastic job and the idea of getting the five doctors together is enjoyable. It hails back to the famous Three Doctors episode, where the enemy was a renegade Timelord called Omega, I think.
Utlimately, the entry is pretty weak. Every hallmark monster is thrown into the mix and the doctors crowd on stage cancelling each other out. Add in the side characters and you get a rare mess of a production. Ironically, the best thing I remember about this episode was a completely new creature, a lightening quick android who could throw out darts from the ends of his fingers. As I remember, he gives the Cybermen a run for their money.
