(Review written 12 Oct 2008.)  Multiple jeers to A&E for its sorry, shoddy practices.  Many weeks before the release of the 25th Anniversary Edition, I contacted A&E three times to find out if this were a digitally remastered version of "Jewel in the Crown." I got no response to my two e-mails to A&E, and their customer service rep on the phone didn't even know they had a new edition being released.  A&E's previous DVD release in 2001 received many negative reviews because of the poor technical quality of the transfer (e.g., poor sound, light, filmy picture).  I hoped that A&E would have used this opportunity to provide a high quality technical transfer that such a brilliant series deserves.  In the absence of any information from A&E, I ordered the new edition from amazon, but immediately returned it after seeing it had not been remastered.  A few days after I mailed the 25th Anniversary Edition back to amazon, I finally got a letter from A&E confirming the new edition was just a repackaged version with no technical upgrades.  It is greatly disappointing that A&E seems so unfamiliar with its products, that its customer service is so unresponsive, and -- most importantly -- that A&E does not have enough respect for such a classic series to see it gets the technical makeover it deserves.  It would also have been appropriate to have included extras to this anniversary edition, but none were.  In short, if you already own the previous DVD release, do not bother with this version as there is no difference beyond the new packaging.
