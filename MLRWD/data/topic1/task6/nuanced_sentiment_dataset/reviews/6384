I've seen this film several times and I always find it disturbing because it strikes me as classic Hollywood in that though the Civil War is central to the film, at no point is slavery ever mentioned.  Which is to say that the film turns on the reconciliation of North and South and their mutual interests, which come to the fore as they are fighting Mexicans.  Though I must say that the scene with Wayne and Hudson swigging bourbon as they recount the war is entertaining, ultimately, the film's unwillingness to explore the nature of their difference--which could be their differing notions of whether people should be property (albeit John Wayne's films generally portray his relations with people of color as paternalistic at best), is left unexplored, as if the Civil War was some kind of minor family squabble that requires whites rediscovering their mutual interests to overcome.  It could be that this is a film about honor, but it feels more to me like the usual Hollywood distortion of history.
