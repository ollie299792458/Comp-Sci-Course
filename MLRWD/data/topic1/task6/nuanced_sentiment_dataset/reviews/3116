This " Nick Knight" Vampire Cop was aired on CBS in  about 1990 or so.
 This movie was set up to be a pilot that didn't make it starring Rick Springfield in the title role.
Alas, poor Rick I am such a big fan, but TV shows have not treated him well.

I have seen the reviews and understand where the confusion might come in between this and Forever Knight
I think if I remember correctly that it was CBS who first retooled this to put on their late night crime series
 and they got rid of most- but kept some- of the actors from this and added others like Geraint Wyn Davies in the title role,
instead of Rick Springfield and renamed it "Forever Knight" then I believe that the SYFY channel picked it up.

Now as I've written I am a huge Rick fan so when this came out I watched it and I know this is campy but it's kind of fun and Springfield fans love to see him but take it for what it is.

And I  also watched when it was revamped and I really liked the Forever Knight series too.
So for those who want to watch a good campy vampire-cop movie starring Rick Springfield this is for you. BUT if you are a die hard fan of the
Forever Knight series, tread lightly this may not be for you.
To all of my fellow Rick Fans enjoy the ride in Nick Knight's Cadillac because it's fun.
Thanks for reading
