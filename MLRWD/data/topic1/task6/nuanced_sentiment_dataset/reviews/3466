William's presentation of Stanley in this play is a dramatic example of the stereotypes many Americans held toward Slavs and, in this case, Poles. The "I am not a Polack" text is one I have memorized and used to explain to people, and particularly to other Poles, who use that term why I am insulted by it. Stanley's beast like actions and appearance are used to lead the audience or reader down the path of revulsion and maybe to enlightenment. The struggle to achieve a complete role and acceptance as citizens of the United States has been a battle for all ethnic groups except for the Anglo-Saxon founders. Free white citizens (and mostly landholders) were the only ones who could vote in the new nation. All other groups that arrived later were put through a test of "whiteness". Irish, Asiatics, Italians, Slavs, Greeks- all of them. Each has had to win the acceptance of the earlier arrivals to be regarded as "white". Skin color was not the sole requirement. To learn about this dark side of American history read: "Whiteness of a Different Color: European Immigrants and the Alchemy of Race", by Matthew Frye Jacobson, and "Working Townard Whiteness: How America's Immigrants Became White", by David R. Roediger, in that order. Today Hispanic and other immigrant populations are facing the same tests to be accepted as "white" and gain full American citizen and political rights, cultural respect, and economic rewards.
