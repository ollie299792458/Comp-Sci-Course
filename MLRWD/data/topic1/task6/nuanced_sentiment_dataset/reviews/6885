This flawed but pleasant film relates imaginary events from the life of the playwright Moliere.  It is a whimsical fantasy along the lines of Shakespeare in Love although it's hardly fair to compare the two.  Shakespeare in Love benefits from 1) better, more familiar characters, 2) a better more suspenseful story augmented by the deft touch of Tom Stoppard, and 3) packs a whole lot more star power to boot.  Moliere although visually pleasant, is somewhat plodding and overlong, and about as exciting as a drive through the French countryside.  You won't need your blood pressure medicine for this one because there's no drama here.  The characters and their problems were never real enough to compel me to care, nor was the humor funny enough to make me laugh.  But for some strange reason I still enjoyed this harmless little movie.  It might be there's a closet Francophile in me, it might be that movies based upon the lives of real famous people are always at least a little interesting, but probably I was just in the right mood for a slow drive in the country, or it's cinematic equivalent: Moliere.
