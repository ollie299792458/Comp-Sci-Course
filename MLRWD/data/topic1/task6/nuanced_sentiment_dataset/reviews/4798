Fist off if ur a true fan of 80 s horror, horror comedy etc.. What i mean if you find ur self looking for lost gems of the 80 s, because u have already exahusted all the mainstream films, and find urself wanting 2 watch all the horror from this decade,and late 70's and, early 90's then give it a try while its still around. It was out for a while then went out of print. Good 2 see its back, in a remasterd state, with some xtras. I love the late 80's horror comedys alot, but i find myself wanting 2 watch all the 1980 to 1982 films the most right now.Because they try 2 scare you, the music[scores], and nostalgic feel.The films about a killer on campus picking off victims, nothing ground breaking, or extra cool deaths, like in Sleepaway camp,just b4 the dawn.But has watchable characters, added humor,decent supense.Things wrong with it; no back story or reason behind the killer, if there was i didnt catch it, and the weird little gay guys atrip, but, he makes it memorble,and it leaves you asking "so what happend". But like i said if you are wanting a 80's horror film to ad to ur colletion, this is a good one. Its not pure crap like some i've seen from this decade. Its a true slasher.
