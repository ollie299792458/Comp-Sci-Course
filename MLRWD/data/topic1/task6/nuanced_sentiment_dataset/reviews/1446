This review is short, because if we went into detail about every disappointment we had about this film, it would take an entire page...or two.

Every part of this movie is poorly done and looks totally fake.  I don't understand why someone thought that Rambo meets the inbred family was a good idea.  Even the title doesn't make sense....this plot was not a "wrong turn", the title should have been "badly chosen location."  The entire movie is cheesy at best.  Rollins may be a nice person, but he's not a great actor....the only reason he stands out in this movie is because the rest of the cast is absolutely horrible.
This is a very low budget, poorly produced, poorly directed and miserably edited movie.  My backyard is even a scarier location than what they chose.  We actually wasted the $20 on this movie and I do emphasize WASTED.  We did so, because we did LIKE the first Wrong Turn movie and were truly excited to see this one.

If you want to get drunk and watch this movie (and I do mean "drunk") RENT it, do not waste your hard earned money on this junk.
If there was a way to give "NO STARS" we would have given it that rating.  Unfortunately 1 star is the lowest on the scale.
