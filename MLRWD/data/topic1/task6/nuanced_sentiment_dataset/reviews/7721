I haven't seen the DVD, but some time ago I saw the movie in the theatre. Please forgive me for not having clearer details for you.
While I agree that this movie isn't a classic by any means, I will say that there is an aspect of the film that appealed to me. The film impressed me with it's depiction of the mental state that has often been described as either an "out of body experience" or "possessed and out of body control".
In the movie, one of the characters has his body possessed and he is seen as inhabiting a room. The room has secrets that he is attempting to guard from the invading entity. The door to the room is locked and being assaulted by the entity. 
While in the room, the character looks through a window and sees all the things that his body is doing, but of course which he isn't performing. He speaks to the other characters without being heard. He laments the horror that befalls his friends but is helpless to assist them. His only recourse is to fight off letting the entity enter the room.
I love innovation and I thought that this was creative. Perhaps the other reviewers remember these scenes, or will look at the movie again and hopefully see the "new" thought that was given to this reported phenomenon. Mass murderers, psychos, demon possessed individuals who commit atrocities upon our society, could creatively be depicted in this fashion in film and it would give greater depth to their story of not feeling responsible.
Anyway, I thought that it was innovative, and it's probably the sole reason that I will purchase the DVD.
