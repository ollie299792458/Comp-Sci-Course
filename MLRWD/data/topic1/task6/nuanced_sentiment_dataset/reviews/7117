Chris Cooper doesn't fool around when selecting a script he wants to breath life into. In this movie he portrays a man whose life was sucked right out of him when caught beyond a shred of doubt spying against the U.S.

What motivates a man to turn against his own nation? Watching this movie and reading more about Robert Hanssen on the Internet, I would say the reason is manyfold and money is definitely one of them. Loneliness and the sense of not-belonging is another. His hunkered down self-esteem is a  definite player. So, in summary, Hanssen was high on IQ and low on the emotional quotient.

Being in the wrong place (the FBI) he took the path of least resistance to fulfill an emotional vacuum deeply rooted within. Guilty nevertheless. Had he been living in Russia, he would have helped the U.S. It's the contrast in his life with which he could define and make sense of himself.

I wonder what's happening to this person in solitary confinement. Is it merely the contrast of prison bars reflecting on the wall that defines him now?
