Hey mates,

Okay, to start it off. I was born in 1985 -- two years before this show even aired. Therefore I was a bit young to enjoy this television series. However, I must say, that even if the music has changed, I LOVED this season! I had many laughs at Hanson especially because he's such a clear cut guy that if it ain't done by the book he's gonna remind everyone about it. I especially love it when he goes Punk in the last episode, I have to get a pick of him in the "Plaid Bondage Pants" HOT STUFF there mates!

Another thing you gotta know is that as a writter, Johnny Depp is an inspiration to me because of all the different characters he plays. Even on othis show, you know who he is, and yet he can play a totally different character and be Tom Hanson. All the actors pulled it off rather well -- and I especially appreciated the porn ring episode with the teen modeling with Judy.

It's great to see that stuff that teens deal with now, it had to be dealt with in their parents/grandparents generation. Just goes to show that we ain't too different after all!

ta,

Johnny Penn
