To give you some context, I am not a horror movie freak.  I rarely watch them.  But I really like Joss Wheadon's Firefly and Serenity.  After reading that he was involved in this movie, described as a twist on the classic horror genre, I was interested enough to pre-order this without reading any reviews.  I was hoping that he had brought some of the inventiveness and interesting characters he displayed in Firefly/Serenity to this effort, and I was interested to see what he came up with.  Alas, my hopes were not realized and I am sorry that I bought the DVD vs. pay-per-view.  I watched it all the way through but I am not sure I will ever watch it again.  It definitely is a new twist on the genre, but the cutting back and forth between the two scenarios is a bit jarring, and with less time for each, it means that the characters in both are not as fully developed or sympathetic.  And I didn't find the underlying secret to be that shocking, scary or compelling.  I think the problems start in the script and I'm not sure that any director could have made a better movie out of it.  At least you can say that Wheadon and co. didn't pull any punches at the end and did not go for the feel-good ending.
