The Adventures of Huck Finn takes us back to a time in American history that was almost barbaric. Don't get me wrong; this mid-late 1800s time period was a very important and crucial turning point in our country's history, but the values that were held by most were just plain dumb. That is why this movie is so poignant-it teaches many lessons along the way, while not being so sweetly sugarcoated. We see African-Americans being beaten. We see our mischievous main character, Huck, being abused by his alcoholic father. We see thieves lying to gain a family fortune. But yet, we seem to laugh and cry throughout Huck's many adventures.
  Huck was way ahead of his time for a young kid. He is a great liar, and very cunning. He evens goes so far to fake his death so that he can run away from his foster parents and abusive father. He coincidentally meets up with Jim, a friend of his whom happens to be a slave. Jim wants to escape to the free states to provide a better life for him and his family. Huck just wants to run amuck and experience life. Actually, it is thought that Jim murdered Huck. Together, they strengthen their friendship, and run into many colorful characters during their journey.
