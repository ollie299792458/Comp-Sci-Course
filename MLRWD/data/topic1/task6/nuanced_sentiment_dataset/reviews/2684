I love old, cheesy sci-fi movies, as long as they have some kind of redeeming feature. If they are just plain bad, then I draw the line. This movie is a step above the usual dreck when it comes to storyline, with some decent acting, an a pretty honest attempt to tell a sci-fi/horror story that might make sense.

It involves a supposedly haunted mountain top in the Swiss alps that seems to swallow up people who approach a weird, perpetually cloudy area.I won't go into too much detail, so that you don't know the entire story, but it does make an attempt to explain it's horror.

Then the aliens show up, and the most HILARIOUS, UNGODLY BAD special affects you have EVER seen start! I laughed so hard I almost fell out of my chair. I made better monsters for school in the 3rd grade! To me, it made the movie even more enjoyable, but I imagine most people will gawk in astonishment before leaping to the TV to SHUT THIS EMBARRASSMENT OFF!!!!!

All I can say is, if you love movies that are so bad they're funny, then you will enjoy this classic tale of "we ran out of money, someone color up some balloon monsters", tale.
