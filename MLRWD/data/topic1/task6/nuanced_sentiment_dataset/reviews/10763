A predictable storyline, dragging pace, and jokes stale enough to make you wince keep this film from getting off the grond. Many attempts at humor feel canned and fail miserably - an elderly woman proudly wearing a sex toy she mistakes for a necklace, a matronly Scottish aunt suddenly blurting out "Athol" at the dinner table, suggesting a possible name for her nephew's future child...and so on. I sensed no real chemistry between Patrick Dempsey and Michelle Monaghan either. I wondered why anyone would want to root for her in the end when she humiliates her husband-to-be at their wedding, a man who treats her like royalty and showers her with devotion throughout the film, only to fling herself into the arms of her long time best friend, an immature womanizer who never realized he had any real feelings for Hannah, though he's had ten years to think about it. The movie ends with Dempsey flying off a runaway horse and into the wedding chapel right before the "I do's" like a....well, like an Athol. Ugh. The one star is for Sidney Pollack, who is the funniest thing in the movie.
