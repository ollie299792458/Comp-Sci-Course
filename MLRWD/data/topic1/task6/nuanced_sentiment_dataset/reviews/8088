THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS

This was an interesting attempt, but it fell far short of everything it should have been. Why? Because everything this movie relied on was the physical side of fear (things jumping out of nowhere). It started out interestingly enough, seemingly an alright flick. But when it ended, it just hinted that he could travel through time and space without actually explaining anything about it. And when it ended, it left one wanting more. A lot more. So why did I say it was insulting? This movie may as well have come right out and said that the boogeyman can only get you if you're scared. So don't be scared, right? Wrong. Fear is a natural human emotion that one feels when their life is in danger. When we are in severe danger, or even if a threat is present, our old friend terror comes up and tells us, "Hey, moron - run!!" This movie said that we shouldn't fear at all. It said that we should ber killed by the boogeyman or be killed by something else.
