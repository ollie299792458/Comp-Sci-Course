when i first saw this film, a remake of charade, I gave it 2 and a half stars based on thandie newton's performance alone. yet watching it repeatedly I become more fond of it up to 4 stars plus.where cary grant had screen presence and charm superior to wahlberg, thandie newton holds her own and is far more beautiful than audrey hepburn.when you watch this film you must see it as a type of foreign film for it's production techniques, appreciate the scenery and outstanding soundtrack. it is more of a suspense thriller than the original, which was a suspense comedy if that's possible. the french actress who plays the commandant is outstanding as well as the cameos by aznavoir and anna karina.tim robbins is acceptable as the mysterious man who offers assistance to our heroine. director demme cast thandie newton in the hepburn role for he felt her beauty was equal to the task. Well, he's wrong! thandie newton is far more beautiful than miss hepburn and it is her beauty that makes me watch the film over and over! she is the movie see it for her and you'll truly enjoy it!
