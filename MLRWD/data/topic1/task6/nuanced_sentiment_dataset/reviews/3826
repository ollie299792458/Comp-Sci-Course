What a let down!  The promise of "never before seen footage" turns out to be the same "never before seen footage" from the last DVD.  The bonus materials on this disc are a joke (and not in a funny "ha ha" way).  The special "Introduction to the film by Dan Aykroyd" is 23 seconds long. The "Day on the Blues Brothers Tour" is nothing more than a lame performance by the current Blues Brothers at the House of Blues.  But the real insult is the featurette called "Remembering John: An ultimate portrait of John Belushi."  It clocks in at 9 minutes long (including credits).  Ultimate??  This is John Belushi, not Garrett Morris!

You might be reading this wondering, "So what was this guy expecting?"  Well, how about an audio commentary? Perhaps some outtakes?  Bloopers? Maybe concert footage of the REAL Blues Brothers on tour with Steve Martin?  Why not include Blues Brothers performance footage from SNL?  How about revisiting the locations made famous in the movie (the abandoned mall is still standing and still abandoned)?  Instead, they chose to include John performing as the Killer Bee on SNL.  Instead of a track listing booklet inside the case, they'd rather you have an ad for other "great" DVD titles available from Universal.  Instead of never before seen footage, you get the same documentary, the same production notes/pictures, and the same interviews that were included in the previous release.

It's obvious that this was thrown together with little thought or effort.  The Chicago Sun Times did a better tribute piece to the anniversary of the Blues Brothers than Aykroyd did for his own film.

Oh well...only five more years until the 30th Anniversary Edition comes out.
