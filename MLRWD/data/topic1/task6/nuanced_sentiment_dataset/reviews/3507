Hi:

The DVD of the movie The Monster arrived on time and in excellent condition. The purchase price (about $4) is hard to beat.

The movie, about the female serial killer Aileen Wuornos, features superlative acting. It doesn't get any better, folks. I saw the documentary on Aileen Wuornos, which featured several interviews with her. One gets a feel for her mannerisms and personality. Not only did Theron in "The Monster" have her movements down perfectly -- they way she'd throw her head back with her eyes bulging when she was mad, the way she'd burst with rage at little provocaton, her great good humor and exuberance -- but she looked a lot like her. As in the documentary, one couldn't help but like Wuornos -- certainly a lot more than most of the men she was servicing as a hooker.

The first killing was self-defense -- the director showed her briefly holding a saw: Okay, did she dismember the body? Don't slide that past the viewer. We know she wasn't a sweetheart -- after that, as the movie made clear, she was murdering them. In other words, this is a fair portrayal of the woman. And one still can't help but like her.

A student of the cinema might want to watch this film a number of times to catch all the little things the director does with the actors, lighting, etc. There is a lot to watch for. The only issue I had was understanding, at first viewing, how it was that Aileen came to be apprehended. It wasn't entirely clear.

But watch it for the acting. Theron won best actress for this role. I understand the woman who played her lover was nominated for best supporting actress. Bruce Dern was also in the film -- he's always terrific.

If you haven't seen it, you're in for an acting treat.
