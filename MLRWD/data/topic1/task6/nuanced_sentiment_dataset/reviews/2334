Being too young for having caught the original movie serial, or even the reruns on TV in the 50s?, 60s?, I bought this set after watching the new SciFi's Flash Gordon and buying a couple of DVDs from the so-so 1954 series (50 cents each DVD, beat that).

I'm in the middle of this set, but I'm greatly surprised. Forget about the special effects, we are talking about a movie filmed 70+ years ago. And being honest, this Flash Gordon has better effects than many SF movies I have rented that were filmed 20 or 30 years later.

Buster Crabbe is perfect as Flash, always a gentleman, always able to escape at the very last moment and save the day. Ming (Charles Middleton) is evil incarnated, the kind of guy I would not like to meet or work for. Dale Arden (Jean Rogers) is the classic lady in distress and she is very pretty. In a time full of anorexic stars, it's a relieve to know there were better times and see some well-feed chicks like Princess Aura (Priscilla Lawson).

I think the story is well paced, at least Space Soldiers and Trip to Mars. I have read some complaints about plot holes, but since I'm not very picky, I don't see any major problem. And the cliffhangers are well thought, I can only imagine the expectation of the original 30's viewers waiting another week to watch the next chapter.

My only complaint would be with the package. There are no special features (maybe a documentary about movie serials?) and there is no close-caption (I'm not a native English speaker) even that it is advertised in the Amazon page.

Overall, I'm very happy with this set. I would like to see a modern version of Flash in a movie, but I don't know who can fill these actors and actress shoes. After all, now I know that Buster Crabbe is Flash Gordon.
