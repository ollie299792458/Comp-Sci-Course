This was a very enjoyable telling of the classic tale that is very heavy on atmosphere. The DVD has several extra features that really add to its value beyond the straight movie too.
The look and feel of the film are  great. We are taken back to the late 1790s to a very convincing Sleepy  Hollow that has lots of fog and smoke, distant lightning, scary  jack-o-lanterns, and twisted trees. The movie has a great deal of suspense  built into it, and we are treated to lots of tense moments when the  horsemen is near, along with some fairly short, but sometimes very intense  scenes of decapitation. The film is much more of a drama than a horror film  -- the plot is quite complex and usually laid out well. 
For me, one of  the best parts of the film was the Danny Elfman score -- it was very rich,  with lots of interesting effects built into -- brooding strings, eerie  children's chorus, and tinkling bells. It added both suspense and humor to  the film. 
The acting was good. Johnny Depp and Tim Burton work well  together -- Depp shows a nice range of emotions as the somewhat nervous  Ichabod Crane who was investigating the horseman's murders. Christina Ricci  played a very pretty but very mysterious young lady with links to the  horsemen. The whole cast was very good and tended to play a bit over the  top (this is Tim Burton after all). 
A particular favorite for me was  Christopher Lee in a small but powerful role as a judge who sends constable  Crane off to Sleepy Hollow.
The DVD has several very good features,  including commentary by Tim Burton, a nice set of interviews with cast and  crew, and a good "Making of the Movie" feature that shows how a  lot of the special effects (including decapitation) were done. 
A good  movie on a DVD with lots of features!
