Runaway Jury is the equivalent to seeing a democratic convention being covered live on Television. All the flair of the righteous few but no real solutions to help the real problems at hand, which is the case with this well intention but really flawed movie.  It's easy to see the ramifications of the violence other to see who is really responsible because of the need to identify with the victim, which is noble but flawed because we are can be easily blinded by our outrage and need for justice. The makes of Runaway Jury would rather make a moratorium on outrage other than a platform for conflicting views, and it's the viewer who pays for it in the long run because it gives a very simple answer to a very complex, and not very simple problem.  Despite the flaws of this well-meaning exercise in righteousness, it's the performances that are really the real reason to digest this movie. Gene Hackman plays this character all the time, but he does it so well that you don't mind seeing him do it again. Dustin Hoffman is just as good as well but it seemed like he was just following on Hackman's coat tails in certain scenes even though their big face off in the mens room is a classic. The real kicker though is Rachel Weisz, who actually steals the movie from both of them with a superb performance that literally makes your heart jump. You root for her all the way, even when her motives and politics are not really fully explain. 
Despite the strong performances of Weisz, Hackman, and Hoffman, The movie fails to put a real face on the gun problem, and to parade gun shot victims in order to try to sell a side in order to outrage the viewer in just as irresponsible as the gun manufactures who depend on the gun nuts in order to sell their product
