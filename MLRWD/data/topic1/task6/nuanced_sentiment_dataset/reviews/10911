Most American movies made during the 1940's about World War II tend to overplay patrioism ( fighting for Mom, Apple Pie, etc ), while neglecting technical and historical fact.  Battleground stands apart from the average  period movie in that it was obviously researched and made use of military  advisors who served in and around Bastogne.  The characters are real.  No  heroics.  Just guys that want to make it home.  One character in fact  comments sarcastically on the whole " Mom, Apple Pie" propaganda  being fed to the folks at home.  A movie like this would probably not have  been made during the war, and it says something for the makers of  Battleground that, only four years after the end of the conflict, they  chose to break the mold.  Apart from minor technical details ( Glider  troops with the Airborne tab above the Screaming Eagle ), and historical  ones ( the American uniformed "Grief" commandos operated well to  the northeast of Bastogne in the St.Vith-Malmedy area), this movie  represents, in my opinion, about the best the 1940's has to offer.
