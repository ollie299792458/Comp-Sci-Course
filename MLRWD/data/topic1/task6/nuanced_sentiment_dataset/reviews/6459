This movie has always had two or three of the hottest women's backsides shots this side of Mariylyn Monroe in Laurence Olivier's study. The sultry, hot, tightly-wrapped Olimpia Carlisi (with a visibly stirred Alan 'Yosarian' Arkin in apparent emphatic agreement)is in two of them and of course the tight uniformed Susanne Bennett in the well-known pre-mission briefing scene with Orson Welles.

But this movie has not worn well over the years. Much of it comes off now as typical, end of the 60s pseudo-experimental, college-film-school influenced, pretentious radical posturing.

The "Dream" sequences are examples of this, and themselves are boring. The movie is still sometimes funny, but the comic scenes, after one has outgrown the self-important parts of it, are found to be all stacked in the front of the movie. The movie gets more full of itself and less comic as it goes along.

The commentary audio track feature that is available on this edition, with Steve Soderberg and this movie's director, Mike Nichols, if listened to as an evaluation of these two personalities, leads one to believe that it should not be surprising that one of these guys would create such self-important pap and the other would just adore it and fawn all over the director. Soderberg sounds just like a typical West-Coast pretentiously cool psuedo-intellectual, while Nichols sounds like he's acting the role of an aging beatnik. Soderberg's comments almost always involve the cinematography, the staging of shots, etc. He never says anything about the acting nor the writing. He also just fawns pathetically over Nichols all the time. The only value of the commentary feature are the precious few anecdotes that Nichols volunteers (which Soderberg's questions did absolutely nothing at all to prompt) such as the amusing fact that the Roman traffic cop in the Carlisi summer dress strolling scene is none other than screenwriter Buck Henry.

Bottom line, it's only worth it for the bottoms!
