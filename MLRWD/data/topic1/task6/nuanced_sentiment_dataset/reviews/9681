Sorry to those who loved this DVD - guess it did nothing for me.
To put it in context - I saw them live in 1979 (was centre of row 5 from the stage too) shortly after the worldwide release of "Live At Budokhan".  So that concert is forever burned into my brain and so I guess seeing this DVD ruined that memory of just how good they can be.
Guess I was expecting an "At Budokhan" like performance (and song list) with modern sound (DTS and the like), but got neither.
Look if you want a collection of all the songs CT have done over the last 30 years this is pretty good (and if you view it in that context maybe I'd give it 3 stars).  But if you want to see them like they were in their heyday doing stuff from their first 4 albums - you'll be disappointed.
I still like cheap trick alot (I share a birthday with Robin Zander so there's nothing wrong with that) - but they don't recyle as well 30 years later as say, the Eagles, did (at least before they did the dirty and kicked Felder out of the band - now I dislike their new stuff intensly)...
Anyway, back to CT (IN POSTSCRIPT) - the 1978 "At Budokhan" DVD is FINALLY released.  If you like CT you have to get that - it's magic, just as I remember them all those years ago back in the 70s.
