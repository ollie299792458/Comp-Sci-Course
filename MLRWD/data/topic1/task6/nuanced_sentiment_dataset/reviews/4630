A decent storyline and acceptable acting. The characters all tend to be stereotypes, but that doesn't detract too much. The limited sequences with real aircraft mainly serve to highlight the lack of realism in the CGI flying sequences. But then film makers have yet to produce realistic flying sequences with CGI. I'm just about convinced it can't be done.

Take any movie with CGI air combat sequences and compare those sequences to ones in movies like "The Battle of Britain" and "Tora! Tora! Tora!" and you'll realize just how pitiful CGI truly is. And CGI explosions (of anything) pale in comparison to movies where they really blow stuff up.

As an ex-AF pilot and military aviation historian (who has also written a WW I historical novel about air combat, 'Once a Knight'), I can't help but cringe whenever I watch CGI aircraft scenes. This movie was no exception.

Despite all of that, I did enjoy the movie. Overall, it was fun, and that's what movies are all about in the end.

One caution: I bought this DVD without noticing that there are two versions -- a 1-disc and a 2-disc. I ended up with the 1-disc with essentially no special features. I really wanted those special features (more than the actual movie). So be warned...and spend the extra couple of bucks for the 2-disc version!
