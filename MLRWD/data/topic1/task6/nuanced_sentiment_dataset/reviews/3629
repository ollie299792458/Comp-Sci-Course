I do agree with some of the other folks that this might not be a documentary in the strictest sense of the word.  That's getting into semantics a bit too much for me!  My 5 year old son and good friend and I rang in the new year watching this film.  It had all of us gasping for breath and choking back tears from the sheer grace and beauty of the birds and of our world.  I never before have wished so much to be reincarnated as a bird.  Gorgeous!
The hunting and trapping scenes in this film are appropriate and neccessary, not just to pull at our heartstrings, but to emphasise the pure danger in the migration - from *all* angles.  It might make you sad to see the geese fall from the sky - and it is part of the circle of life - and it gives me more respect for the work they do twice a year.  Amazing!
I am a fan of Jacques Perrin, from his previous film, Microcosmos (I highly recommend it) and had no idea this was also one of his, until about 30 seconds into the film.  He is gifted and inspired.  I understand why and agree with his use of imprinting techniques to acheive this film.  Superb!
