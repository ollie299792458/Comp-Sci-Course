Initially I stayed away from this film because of the subject matter. A child's disappearance is not a pleasant subject even when it is a backdrop for a great detective thriller. I am sorry I was reluctant. This film is one of the best films made in the last year. Ben Affleck directs a film every bit as masterful as Sean Penn's MYSTIC RIVER. The story takes place in a small community in Massachusetts.  Ben's brother, Casey plays the role of a young private detective, Patrick Kenzie, who is asked by the aunt of a child, gone missing, to aid the police in the search of her three year old niece. Kenzie's partner, Angela Gennaro, is ably portrayed by actress Michelle Monaghan. The search for the child is pretty straight forward; however, by the end of the film it becomes obvious that nothing is as it appears. Like the film CHINATOWN of some years ago this story has a lot going on under the surface. There are some tough moral dilemmas faced by the detective couple the resolution of which will give the viewer a lot to ponder. Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, two of America's finest actors add substance to the story. Don't miss this film!
