To begin, the film "RIZE" is truly an inspiration to any child from anywhere that you can steer clear of addictive and violent behavior if you believe in yourself. The beauty, in my mind, behind David LaChapelle's film is the inside look into the areas in and around South Central Los Angeles. Personally, the term "south central" has always connoted a picture of the popularized Bloods v. Crips battle. However, LaCahapelle breaths life into the individuals who live and manage to survive there because its their home. Tommy the Clown's antics aside, the simple concept of bringing dance to children who are predisposed to gang life is brilliant. Especially coming from a former addict and inmate, the message behind "RIZE" (in a literal sense) broke my heart. However, my only criticism of the movie would be that there wasn't enough focus on the briefly mentioned, and jaw dropping, topic of a type of loyalty beyond normal adherence. The truth in the kids voices regarding a battle of oppression that is beyond their power to alter, yet, they fight every minute of every day to just not get shot, brought tears to my eyes. And, trust me, "RIZE" is so far from the normal "Hallmark" or "Lifetime" tear jerker that the surprise made me realize the power behind admitting to yourself when you take too many things for granted.
