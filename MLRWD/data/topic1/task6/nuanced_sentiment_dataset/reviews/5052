Honestly, this movie didn't match what I'd pictured or expected at all. I thought the infamous rape scene would be a lot more violent, with the guys actually at least TRYING to stand up for themselves and get away, and fight for their dignity like I would (despite there being a gun there, yes that WOULD change one's reaction in that situation). The scenery was nice but I live in Washington where there's scenery like that all over! LOL It was interesting (to a certain extent) seeing how everyone changed throughout the movie, and even though all the acting left some to be desired (yes including Burt's, sorry just my opinion), I would have done WAY worse, probably would've overacted and hammed it up!

Overall summary: I was disappointed, and I think it could have been worse but could have been way better. And I much agree that a twist at the end, like them turning into the raping mountain men, would have been a HUGE changeup in the movie and would have made the whole film different and differently known.
