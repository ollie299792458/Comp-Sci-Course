agree with the last reviewer on the scene in the alpine lodge.  The girl was indeed beautiful and the scene was perhaps the one I remember the most and the one I look forward to seeing over and over again(and the one I  always replay at least once).  However, the object of this review would  have to be the movie itself. 
This was perhaps the only movie that I  enjoyed with Peter Sellers as Clouseau. His depiction as the bumbling  inspector in Pink Panther was superb. It's unfortunate that he decided to  change his style with subsequent Panther movies. 
As usual, David Niven  was equally magnificent as the "cat burgler" with Capucine and  Robert Wagner equally enjoyable in their roles. For those who have not seen  this movie, it centers around the eventual attempted theft of the Pink  Panther - a jewel of immense value.  It belongs to a Princess (portrayed by  Claudia Cardinale) who obviously comes from some ficticious Muslim country  whose enemies of her regime wishes the bauble be returned to the people.  The acting is first-rate as is the cast of this fantastic comedy. It is one  of those movies I enjoy over and over again and never tire of it's showing.  Of course, I will always enjoy the scene in the alpine lodge, as well as  the young lady who performed so magnificently and one who I have had a  crush on for far too many years.
