I bought this in tandem with "The Poseidon Adventure" (the granddaddy of all the disaster flicks, still a favorite and superbly restored on DVD) but I was less than pleased with "The Towering Inferno" on DVD. If memory serves, several small but relevant scenes are missing: why Paul Newman's architect character was away at the beginning of the film (He was hoping to design an environment-friendly community in the Pacific Northwest and chuck the big-city life); what exactly Robert Wagner's job was (The Glass Tower's PR man) and why only one of the three scenic elevators was working (A dock strike in Japan held up delivery of the extra elevator cables, as William Holden explains). Also, Maureen McGovern's rendition of "We May Never Love Like This Again" is truncated. Finally, a lot of the background soundtrack seems murky. OK, this is very geeky stuff, but I remember this movie well, and a guilty pleasure should be enjoyed in all of its restored, cheesy glory. I love this flick, but am not crazy about this version.
