Peter Pan, one of the most enduring stories of all time, finds its ideas and visions captured perfectly in this film adaptation.

THE GOOD: Just about everything.  The script is true to its literary roots, the casting is absolutely perfect, the visuals are wonderful, the score is beautiful, and the special effects are classy and elegant.  Special applause for ending the creepy tradition of having women in the lead role.  Rather than confusing the crap out of us with Cathy Rigby or Mary Martin, Jeremy Sumpter as the lead *is* Peter Pan.  He is convincing, entertaining, and fully believable.  The use of colour to convey moods is both beautiful and effective.  The climax gives you chills.  It is wondrous how much excitement and joy has been squeezed into this gem.  The audio is haunting and perfect.

THE BAD: There is nothing bad about Peter Pan.  It could not have been done any better.  This is the definitive version for all time.

THE VERDICT: The is a great looking and sounding film.  The story is wondrous and exciting.  The actors are all uniformly perfect for the roles.  Jeremy Sumpter in particular is a revelation.  I really believe that this version of Pan is one of the great cinematic achievements of film.  Everyone should watch this - it's pure enjoyment that represents everything that the cinema should be.  I have also found it to be one of the most re-watchable movies ever; it can give you butterflies in your stomach just as much on the tenth viewing as the first.  One of the most solid 5 stars out of 5 that I can name.
