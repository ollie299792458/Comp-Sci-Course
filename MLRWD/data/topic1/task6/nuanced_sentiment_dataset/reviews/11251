In the height of the Holywood remake craze, the classic horror movie Black Christmas has been unnessarily remade. While the movie is greatly flawed I feel that Dimension holds more responsiblity than the filmmakers.

Film
While the Black X-Mas is mainly a remake, the movie seems to take more small elements from Black Christmas than the orignal story. For example, Clarie is killed in a similar fashion as in original. Heather is irritated into going home like Clarie. Megan is lured to the attic like the original Mrs. Mac. Eve is discovered dead like the outlook officer in the original and so on.

Personally, I'm on the fence about the gore. The eyeball gouging, referring to Meagan's death and Melissa's international death, was a little too much for me. In addition, the fact that the murders are done to such cute girls make the gore less appealing.

Depending on which verison you saw if you went to the theater, Black X-Mas could rate from mediocre to awful. The international edits, seen in the DVD, would probably have made some of the film, especially the ending, slightly more plausible. The U.S. verison featured on the DVD make the film worse than it already is.

Acting
Despite the weak dialogue and characterization,every single actress does exceedingly well in their performance. However, I can't imagine that any of them would put Black X-Mas on their resumes.

Something to Note
If your looking any of the additional clips feature in the trailer, there was also one tv spot with Michelle Tractenberg pointing a shotgun at someone, it is not on the DVD.

On the whole, Black X-Mas is flawed but mostly at the fault of Dimension Films because of the alternate verison and fake scenes.
