Having read some very positive reviews for "Remember The Night", I went ahead and ordered it from TMC. It was being promoted as the Great Undiscovered Christmas Classic. It wasn't - well, at least my wife and I didn't think so. An example of a Christmas Classic we never tire of is "Christmas In Connecticut" - also starring Barbara Stanwyck.

"Remember The Night" has at least a helping of the very same ingredients that made the aforementioned film a beloved classic. So, why does it fall short?

The film's premise was actually a good one: District Attorney, Fred MacMurray feels sorry for shoplifter, Barbara Stanwyck whom he is prosecuting - eventually inviting her to spend Chrismas at his family's Indiana home. The film's first half plays like a screwball comedy - and the second half isn't sure what it wants to be - "It Happened One Night" or "Double Indemnity".

The downhome shmaltz is the only endearing quality the film has Beulah Bondi wears it well - for awhile. However, when she finds out that little Miss Wrong-Side-Of-The-Tracks has designs on her son - Beulah let's her know that if she marries Fred - she'll be the ruin of him. It comes completely out of left field and kills any Christmasy warmth you may have been feeling about Fred's family.

During the final few scenes - you get the impression the film was going over budget, because everything has a disjointed, "let's wrap it up" feel. The final courtroom scene is so emotionally charged and unsettling that it is out of place in a Christmas comedy. When the music suddenly crescendos and THE END pops up on the screen, it's as if somebody misplaced the last reel of the film. It just ends - leaving all these loose ends from throughout the film dangling like broken branches in an ice storm. And there you sit -, emotionally drained, wishing you'd watched Christmas In Connecticut for the 32nd time instead.
