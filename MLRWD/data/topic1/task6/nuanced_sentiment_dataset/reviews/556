I just picked up my copy, thanks to Best Buy's failure to pull it from their shelves. There was an online article this morning which said that Warner Bros' problem was with releases on some of the music. Being an attorney, this made perfect sense. Probably their licensing agreements on the songs didn't extend to DVD issuances (after all, DVDs weren't an issue when LFN was made), and Warner Bros could have faced potential litigation if they hadn't pulled the DVDs. This probably also explains why we haven't (and probably never will) see the "Charmed" series released on DVD. Just consider the hundreds of artists whose music is featured in "Charmed" and also consider that, unless a prelease waiver was already obtained, Warner Bros may have to negotiate individually with each of those artists before they can release those episodes on DVD. Thank you Amazon for trying. Thank you Best Buy for coming through, and good luck Warner Bros. This isn't your fault, but you may want to have a talk with the person who overlooked this minor detail.
