I really really really wanted to love this DVD. I've always had a thing for the great jazz trumpet players:  Miles Davis, Jack Sheldon, Bobby Hackett, on down the line.  But there were at least two, maybe more songs on this set that bothered me a bit.  For instance "What Are You Doing For The Rest Of Your Life?".  Perhaps Legrand's best song. Although I liked the Sting vocal, I think Botti really needed a mute, (also, the drummer needed brushes).  That's just my take on this song however.

I also didn't care for this version of Young's "When I Fall In Love". And how can the great Billy Childs (the pianist here) simply resort to some simple blues chords during his solo?

For my taste, overall, the program was a bit overproduced and not as lyric as an instrument like the trumpet might dictate. Botti has great chops, but I feel that he relies a little too much on certain musical cliches.  My adivse to him is tone it down, emphasize the melody more, and learn when to use the mute. Also, maybe get a new drummer.  But, hey, he's the guy rolling in dough right now, not me.  Maybe I should listen to him?

I do have to applaud his appeal for parents to turn off Star Search and take their children to hear serious musicians, whether jazz or classical.

In all deference, if you are a fan of Botti and his albums, then this is probably going to be a great DVD for you.

If you are like me, a music lover (sometimes jazz) just encountering the music of Chris Botti, then you will have to make up your own mind. This is a serious musician I believe, and one well worth acquainting yourself with.  Although the show didn't work entirely for me, it may do wonders for you.
