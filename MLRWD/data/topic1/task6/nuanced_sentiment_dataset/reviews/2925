As a fan of Martyrs, director Pascal Laugier's follow-up to St. Ange (which, if you didn't see it in other reviews here, was the original, more appropriate title to House of Voices), I was eager to find whatever connections I could between his two works. I found St. Ange to be quite an impressive debut, with some of the same cinematic ideas explored as in Martyrs but with a strikingly more restrained mood. From that standpoint, I can recommend the movie unreservedly. It's beautifully shot, cleanly edited, and explores the Henry James-type ghost story in ways that are rarely accomplished in recent film.

However, this particular disk has some serious problems. My major pet peeve is that it's overdubbed from French to English--an issue that would be less distracting were more care put into the sound mixing. There are special features (a few deleted scenes and a making-of doc) that allow us to hear the original actors' voices, and I noticed that not only are the voices of the movie proper more harshly distinct from the soundtrack than are the rough cuts, but all spatial control also seems missing: the voices stay pretty much at a constant volume as characters move here and there throughout the rooms. It's distracting. There's also the basic thing that some purists don't like art tampered with (I can read subtitles, darn it), but even if you're not in that camp it doesn't hurt to be forewarned.

On a more positive note: I noticed no issues with the picture transfer, and perhaps my complaints at this point are sort of moot. After searching for a few minutes, I didn't find a competing disk. In that case, it's better to have this version of St. Ange than none at all.
