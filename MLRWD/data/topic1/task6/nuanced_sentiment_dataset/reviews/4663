The animations, illustrations and design of the visuals in Steam Boy has to be one of the top-notch in any ani-movie. The movements and settings of every character was rendered with the utmost care, with dramatic instrumental music to go with it.

Although the animations surpasses many other ani-movies, its lack in emotions and character development takes it quite far down the list. The story itself was confusing, not because of complexity, yet because the film had too much in too little time, giving the viewer barely any time to sum up the information. In short: too much, too soon. The film focuses a little overboard on the animations and effects instead of the story and characters, resulting in a totally non-emotionally driven film at all. If compared to other films of its own genre, such as AppleSeed, Steam Boy fails in many developmental and spiritual aspects. But if you are a fan of kick-arse animation, then this is the film for you.

Excellent, breathtaking scenes and good old classic music makes this film a must-watch for any fans who liked APPLESEED, or Akira.
