Probably sacrilege, but this 1965 movie doesn't hold up too well in today's age. Just my opinion.

Yes, it is dark (with which I'm okay) and somewhat amusing in a biting, satirical kind of way. But it's very VERY slow and plodding...

(** SPOILERS AHEAD **))

Robert Morse plays a British poet who falls in love with the lady cosmetician while making arrangements for his uncle's funeral at a posh, upscale Burbank funeral home (only dead WASPs need apply). At least that's the concept but GETTING there is probably described as meandering at best.

Around half the movie is spent getting the hapless hero TO the funeral parlor... we first start with his venture into LAX... where he promptly gets easily lost... and by the time he presents himself to his Uncle at a Hollywood Studio (looking for a place to stay), we are subjected to a pretty snobby elite of ex-pats who toast pictures of the Queen and swear allegiance to old Blighty while letting the new chap know what's-what.

So by the time his Uncle dies (a suicide following a Studio reshuffle), the nephew makes funeral arrangements at the ostentatious funeral home run by a big boss and staffed by the likes of Liberace. It is THEN that he falls in love...

I won't give it all away but needless to say, he falls hard enough to overcome her objections... then she gets promoted... then there's some sort of misunderstanding... then then... oh never mind.

if you're looking for a fun Ealing-type comedy, then this one ain't it. It is pure satire, a scathing (but fun) exaggeration of materialism and Hollywood and... well, you name it.

It was fun seeing SO many familiar faces... but of course, their 1965 B/W versions. Certainly an all-star cast. It differs from the book apparently but I never read the original "The Loved One" by Evelyn Waugh.
