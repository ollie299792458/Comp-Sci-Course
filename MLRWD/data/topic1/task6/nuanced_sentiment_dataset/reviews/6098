Having seen [and owned] many different Handel opera DVD-s, I know the difficulty a director faces when he/she stages a new production. Handel operas are slow-moving in their actions, the arias are repeated, and the frequent use of "castrati" singers represent difficulty for the audience. With all these problems, many opera directors achieve wonderful, truly enjoyable staging, with excellent singers and orchestras.

Unfortunately, this Partenope is not amongst the good ones. It is especially damning to have a good baroque orchestra with an pretty and elaborate scenery wasted on this direction. The acting and the direction are like at a highschool performance, which problem is typical of the usual Eurotrash. The singers behave like they are at a frat party - probably they were directed to do that. The humor placed on stage is inane, and it does not really help that "Queen Partenope" repeatedly tries to unbotton the pants of her "suitors". The battle scene - which should have been a dance - was a running around the table, and playing paper-scissor-stone. That was a good indication of the whole production. It is amazing that Decca markets something like this. The singers are quite modest, most are not up to singing Handel. It is for example disturbing to hear Andreas Scholl singing his head-voice, then suddenly - and repeatedly - shifting to a [baritone] chest-voice. This was my first exposure to the Copenhagen Opera, and I will try to avoid any more exposure.

So, if you enjoy Eurotrash, buy this DVD. Otherwise, avoid it.
