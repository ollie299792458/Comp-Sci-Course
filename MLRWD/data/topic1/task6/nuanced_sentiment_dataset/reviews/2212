In the movie, Peter Phillip Kenneth Kieth is a young English boy who grows up in South Africa. When his mother gets ill, he is sent of to a bording school. With little money, P.K. is sent to an Afrikaner school, where the students learn to hate the British. He becomes a bed wetter, so his nanny calls on the medicine man to help him overcome his fears. The medicine man teaches P.K. about courage. P.K. learns that his mother had died, and he moves to live with his grandfather. In the English town, P.K. meets Doc. Doc teaches him to look at life in a new way and helps P.K. feel happy again. When Doc is sent to a prison camp, P.K. visits him after school. There he meet Geel Piet, a black man who teaches P.K. to box. "Little beat big when little smart" "First with the head, then with the heart". As P.K. gets older, he lives by those words, and helps the african tribes get along for one breif moment. The tribes see him as the rainmaker. When P.K. is in highschool, he still boxes and meets his highschool sweetheart. P.K. wants to help the african tribes read and write in English. Although apartheid disagrees, he goes against the law and does what is right. P.K. learns that one can really make a difference, but if we all come together as one, we can make the invinceble, the power of one.
This movie really makes you feel like you are in Africa. It is so intresting, that you might even want to watch it a second time. The music also brings the story alive.
I think this movie really teaches you about life during apartheid. The movie would be good for most teens and adults, since there is some violence and language. I would not recommend this movie for younger children.
