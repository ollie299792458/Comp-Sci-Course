I have to admit that I liked the story, but this film certainly isn't going to win any awards for editing. It moves so slowly that you could probably watch a baseball game on another channel at the same time and not miss anything in either the game or the movie. (OK, it's true. I don't like to watch baseball either.)

Apparently, the film maker only had a single camera and a single lens to use. Some of the scenes made me feel claustrophobic because they were shot up close in tight quarters. Most of the scenes take place in one of three tiny apartments and sometimes the camera doesn't move the entire scene.

The acting is mediocre. I think that it takes some skill to pull of scenes where there isn't much dialogue. The long pauses mostly felt empty, even when many of them ought to have been filled with tension. I kept waiting for the characters to develop some chemistry, which they never quite achieved.

Still, I don't regret renting this film -- it has its charms -- but it takes a lot of patience to watch and there isn't much of a payoff.
