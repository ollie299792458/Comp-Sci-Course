Well, I went out and bought it Tuesday morning, and when some friends and I watched it, we were a bit disappointed. If you are a fan who read the comic version of the story, or the novelization that followed<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/055309582X">The Death and Life of Superman</a>, I'm afraid this will fall short of your hopes and expectations, as it did mine.

WARNING: Near Spoilers!

This is a significantly abridged version of the story. There are a couple minutes of touching footage that brings the emotional height of the full story to mind, but the rest is just a slugfest of Superman vs. Doomsday, Superman vs. Dark Superman, Dark Superman doing dark things. There is some nifty plotting by Lex Luthor (portrayed quite well by James Marsters), and for those who remember when Nicholas Cage was slated to play Superman a few years back, keep an eye open for a Kevin Smith cameo attached to a hilarious inside joke. Unfortunately, there isn't even a hint of any of the other DC heroes that were involved in the original story, and Superman's recovery was so truncated that there is no sense of drama attached to it.

END SPOILERS

As a personal observation, I'd also like to point out that I don't care for how Superman's/Clark's face was drawn. The chin is big enough that it's just funny lookin', and the cheek lines are the kind of thing you'd expect to see on a man who's as old as the story of Superman really is... This is just art however, and you can't make art that appeals to everyone, so it's not too big a deal.

The high point of the disc however is the special features, which consist of a series of interviews with the writers & artists who did the original story, and what was going through their minds at the time, and some of what contributed to the reason for writing this story arch. Frankly, I think that the bits & pieces of the story you get during these interviews tell a better version of the story arch than the movie itself. There is also a 2nd disc in CD-ROM format for your computer that has Issue #75 on it, so you can read it for yourself. (Though I would have preferred to have the whole omnibus<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401215505">The Death and Return of Superman Omnibus</a> on there, even if it would have doubled the price).

Anyway, buy this for the special features, and if you have some spare time with nothing else to do, watch the movie also...
