Ilove films that take me somewhere i might never go and im sure rural n.j is one of them - i like the fact that i learned a few nuggets about trains and that they are an obssesion for some .i like a story where a dwarf was the hero - because i am black- i like to see stories about people with differences- eg, gays- etnic groups, the elderly and those with disabilites and such. - show me something new and tell me about them - i already had my fill of ''the beautiful people' acting out a flawless , heroic character  and im sick of uber-violent rapper /thugged- out films and foul mouth comdeians propedup as actors in lame films- The little art house film eg TSA will probrably become more mainstream in the future. People can get enough sensation from cnn and fox news and will  choose not to be entertained the old way - with so called- blockbuster - super violence  and creepy cgi effects- and films like the station agent can get their due respect - not just from cerebral critics but from all o'us out here !!- The staion agent is a great film to add to my collection plus i learned that dwarfs can be sexy too!! Peter Dinklage .. I think you are a serious HOTTIE !
