I wept with joy when I saw this film. Thank you Daniel Craig and everyone involved in getting it to the screen. I highly recommend this most moving and inspirational film, which concerns a slice of history that has never been adequately covered - the activities of Jewish partisans in Byelorussia (connected to eastern Poland). What happened to the brave Jews who fled the ghettos and small villages as the Nazis began their extermination campaign, how did they fare when they sought refuge in the forests? This film details how a band of three brothers survived on the run in the woods, then found themselves welcoming into their camp more and more refugees in need of their help and knowledge of survival techniques. Excellent performances by all concerned esp. Daniel Craig. I've been waiting for this story to be told on film for decades. The closest themed-film to it was a TV film from the mid-80's "Sobibor" starring Alan Arkin and Rutger Hauer, about a concentration camp revolt where Jewish inmates and Russian POW's attacked their guards with stolen rifles and provided time for inmates and rebels to escape to the forests. Another book on this theme published in the 60's was "Treblinka" by Jean-Francois Steiner - although I must add here that the book is now considered controversial because survivors have protested the author's supposed fictional development of certain facts and persons.
