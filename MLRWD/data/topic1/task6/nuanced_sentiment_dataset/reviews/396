I am sorely disappointed.  Based on the Iron Sky web site content and trailers, I was expecting a very different movie.  Nazis actually escaped to the dark side of the moon and are returning after 70 years to perfect some of the things they were working on in 1945?  I'm there!  What kind of heroics will it take for us to defeat evil?  Sure, it would be an action-adventure movie like so many, but at least with new villains.

What I got was a relatively flat attempt at uber-campiness.  Add in an over the top dose of "Gee, but aren't those Americans a bunch of reckless cowboys!" and it just gets old fast.  The dialog and most of the acting are nothing special.  The Nazis are cardboard cut-out Nazis.  Everyone on Earth is an idiot.

There is one semi-bright spot, and that the unexpected homage to the "Hitler learns about" Internet meme.  That cracked me up for the first 15 seconds, then it deteriorated into "effing this and effing that".  Really?  Is that the best you could come up with?

The scenery and special effects are also good.  Not up to the latest Hollywood, but still very good.

Judging from the support they got from the Internet and from various national film agencies, they had the resources to have done so much better.  Why they didn't is anyone's guess.
