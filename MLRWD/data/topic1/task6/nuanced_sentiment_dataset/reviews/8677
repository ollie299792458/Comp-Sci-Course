Be certain that the anime adaptation of Chobits is a total let down, primarily due to its deviation from the original storyline to a point where it's almost offensive. It's littered with filler and recap episodes, and offers a nearly meaningless ending.

*THE GRAPHIC NOVELS ARE EXCELLENT HOWEVER. I STRONGLY URGE THE BUYER TO INSTEAD READ THE MANGA, AS OPPOSED TO WATCHING THE ANIME.

Chobits (as more clearly seen in the manga) proposes that the idea of machines being created in the image of man is not much different to the idea of men being created in the image of God, and so these machines should own the right to exercise the same privileges and liberties human beings do. It was refreshing to see love redefined as a state of mind that is above fleshly desires as well. It is, without exaggeration, a beautiful series, and a personal favorite.
