I agree completely with others. This was nothing like earlier barbie movies which drew from classics fairy-tales and incorporated real ballet, classical music, and girl-power. The references to twitter, facebook, and such will be horribly dated at some point, where the other movies will remain timeless.

That said, I must also acknowledge that this movie inspired my (almost) 8 year old more than any barbie movie so far. She has always had a very unique, artistic sense of style and feels frustrated with the cookie-cutter fashions that are affordable. She hates seeing 10 other girls wearing the same target outfit. She prefers to only wear dresses or skirts, and likes imaginative patterns and (of course) glitter. She loved the idea that fashion design is actually a career, and the DVD extras included an interview with a real fashion designer that works on Barbie.

That was it for her! She spent the next 4 hours furiously drawing every dress design she has ever imagined, and then begged me to teach her how to make them "for real". Next think I know she is signed up for sewing lessons, cutting out fabric scraps to make dresses for her barbie, and anxiously awaiting the chance to make her own clothing.

So, horrible movie? Yes! But... if you have an artistic little girl at home, she might ignore all the trendy-teen-drama nonsense and be inspired by the art of making clothing!
