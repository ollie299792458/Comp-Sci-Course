To be honest I think most "horror" movies are just gore flicks nowadays, with sequels that must have greater body counts and no discernible creativity.  This movie was awesome in that it didn't rely on gore for effect.  It certainly had some blood spattering going on, but that wasn't the focus.  If you want that I highly recommend a six-pack of Newcastle and "Jason Vs Freddy".
What seperates this movie from the million zombie flicks out there isn't so much the fact that the infected are still alive, it's that they sprint at you instead of meandering slowing as they moan.  You can't just push them down either.  As for moaning, they either make no sound at all as they charge you from behind, or they scream at the top of their lungs.  Both alternatives are pretty freaky IMO.
The director made incredible use of point-of-view angles and the accompanying sounds, so you *see* the victim as the infected goes charging at them, and you hear the infected's footfalls and breathing at the same time.  *Very* eery.  The idea that an entire country was wiped out in a month was cool, and the vacant streets of London was nice in an apocalyptic sense.
My only problem with this flick was the "stupid horror movie mistakes".  The country is overrun with insane people who only come out at night and kill anyone they see, so as we walk down the street at night let's have a casual conversation in normal voices....  Or see that empty building?  Let me go check it out alone for no reason....
I overlook the dumb mistakes of the main character and still give this movie 5 stars because it made me start turning on lights when I walk around my condo at night.  It's a tad embarassing but this movie is ... scary.
