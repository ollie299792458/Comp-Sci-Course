This movie is fairly terrible.  Poorly written one liners, characters bastardized from a great comic into unlikable heros.

What upsets me most is Dr. Doom.  In the comics he was a man who learned magic from his mother, when she died he tried to create a device to communicate with her in a hell dimension.  Reed sabotaged the machine and Doom fled to live with monks in Tibet, who built his armor for him.  Then he goes to Latveria, overthrows their government, and makes himself king.  His three purposes in life: Free his mother from hell, kill Reed Richards, and hostile takeover of the world.  BUT, in the movie he is just a guy exposed to solar radiation, turns into metal and has control over electricity.  Wow, lets forget about the comic when making a comic book movie...sound good?

The only redeeming character is Ben Grimm, played by Michael Chiklis.  He actually emotes, even through a 60 lb latex suit.

Excessive reliance on CGI, poor writing, TERRIBLE casting...every thing the comic movie genre needs to help it earn the bad rep it already has.  Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. starring David Hasselhoff was better than this schlock.  Now they are making a sequel, and like a true fan of the Fantastic Four comics, I hold out hope for a decent movie.

They need to hire one of the decent writers from the comic industry to write a story for these 'normally wonderful' characters.  There is so much potential being wasted.  Rent it if you want, but I wouldn't pay money to own it.
