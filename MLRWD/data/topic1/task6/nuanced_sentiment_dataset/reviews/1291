We ALL loved Ice Age. We all got wide-eyed with excitement over the announcement and trailers for The Meltdown. We all walked instead of ran to the theaters, we all rubbed shoulders with the kids who got all the jokes at their level, and none that were above. It was during the first fifteen to twenty minutes of the movie that we realized that this movie was going to give us Sid, Manny and Diego, and play the same pick-on-Sid-because-he's-the-littleguy scenario. Diego is the most consistant from the first film, Denis Leary is the best voice for this character. Along with Diego, Manny the Mammoth also plays the voice of reason, while Sid still dreams of stardom in a world where stardom gets you nowhere. Queen Latifah actually fits in well with the three, and while she is a new addition, she can't go with the trio with out her brothers, played by Josh Peck and the voice that never dawned on you - Seann William Scott.

While the first movie gave us side splitting laughs, the second one lacks the issue of having to match the first film. Adding a few new characters and reversing the plot of the first one is not enough to steamroll the crowd that thirsts for the laughter that numero uno brought. The pros of this movie is the two creatures that we first meet frozen in the ice. They give the movie hope, but in the end, it'll take more than a secondary voice by Jay Leno to save the sequel of spring.
