Otherwise known as Rocky VI, this Stallone driven drama is not too bad at all. Having milked the franchise over the years Stallone is still able to pull the heartstrings. This one focuses on Rocky's comeback from retirement in an exhibition match with cocky prize fighter. You are on Rocky's side all the way as this capitalises as the battler making it good against all the odds, in other words the same formula as Rocky's I to V. Somehow it still works and this one is quite different than the others as Stallone really is getting too old so there is no denying where the agenda of the film lies.

The fight sequences are suped up with music video style jump cuts, slow mo, razor sharp edits and some chilling camera work. It again works fine. Rocky is reduced to a shell of what he used to be since his fighting days but the drawcard of the film is to see how he overcomes the odds to get back in the ring and make a contest of himself. The acting is top notch, Adrian is featured in dream sequences showing how Rocky focuses on the past. It is great to see old timer coach Burt in his reprised role again. I like the scenes where Rocky is making friends with a new girl and her son, he seems genuine and is very honourable in his intentions.

It is a likeable film, no swearing at all, and just a bit of blood when they get in the ring and slam each other into kingdom come. But that is expected. The final credits are fun showing many ordinary people making the famous run up the steps and, yes, Rocky music and the famous run up the steps happens from the big man himself, as well as thumping meat, downing raw eggs and running in the snow with his pet dog Punchy. It does not disappoint as a homage to the old Rocky's and Stallone in a hat looks the same as ever; the no good bum who fights for his passion, and it is not all about winning. I was generally delighted with the pleasant tone of the film and the uplifting message of hope and courage.
