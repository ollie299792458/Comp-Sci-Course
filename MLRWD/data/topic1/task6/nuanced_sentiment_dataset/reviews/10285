One of the enduring qualities of Shakespeare's plays is their seemingly infinite adaptability. Since it was first performed in about 1595, "Romeo and Juliet" has been set in many places and in many times.

Alan Brown's masterful 2012 adaptation is set in the present day in an American military academy with the "star-crossed lovers" being two male cadets who are, at first, reading the play in an English Literature class. The plot leaves the pages of the text and becomes a love story which dramatically affects the lives of the cadets who are left behind at the academy over what appears to be a long weekend while the other cadets and staff are on a land navigation course.

Polished performances are given by Seth Numrich, Matt Doyle and Chris Bresky but the real star is Shakespeare's timeless language, superbly handled by the entire cast and as effective in conveying the subtleties of a gay love story in 2012 as it has been in the multitude of settings directors have chosen since the late sixteenth century. Alan Brown's direction is brilliant. Watch out for his "Five Dances" in 2013.
