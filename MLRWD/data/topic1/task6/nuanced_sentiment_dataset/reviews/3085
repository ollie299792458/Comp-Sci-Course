This DVD is only for people who are already in stellar shape, and who have done Tae Bo videos before. Billy Blanks does not take the time to slowly explain how to do each move. In the tutorial, he explains the basic kicks & punches (pretty quickly). There are parts of the first half that are doable, but then quickly he does these moves that have several steps, and he does them SO FAST! Those women on there are incredible! (All the back-up people are ladies.) They make it look very easy, but it is not. I felt like my workout was being extremely ineffective, because there was no time to learn how to properly do the moves before they are all doing them all of a sudden, lighting fast!

I can see how this would be a very fun workout out for people who are familiar with the moves, and who are already fit, doing this video to maintain. But as for me? I did workout up a sweat hopping around my living room like a fool with my boyfriend, and we definitely had a few laughs, but I feel like my time could be much more effective doing a different workout.
