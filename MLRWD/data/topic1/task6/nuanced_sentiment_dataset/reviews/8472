Though I haven't viewed 'this' series yet;I viewed ,some years ago, a PBS series  with the same title.It was  OK but didn't  compare with another TV series , hosted by John Sebastian, entitled "The Golden Age of Rock 'n' Roll"  (10 - part series). I managed tomake a  copy, from TV, on VHS (SLP); and later converted it to 8 mm., Cassette and CD- as yet it hasn't been available on DVD. So I guess I'll make a DVD+R copy  from the 'poor- quality-print VHS). Really I would like to see a 'production-copy' be made available. It really is a 'joyful romp' down memory lane - containing short but interesting trivia but mostly music (8-hr. Series).
**UPDATE**Feb. 24/'05
I've recently bought "the History... ", viewed it and wished that I had rented it instead.It is  quite good BUT contained too much talking.This week I transferred " the Golden Age... "from an 8mm copy. I transferred the series ,DIGITALLY, to HQ DVD+R. A great series - 10 parts (48min./segment) containing complete performances(no voiceovers)only anecdotes between performances.*the segments are  Guitar Heroes;Rockabilly Beat;Legendary Ladies;Party Music; Hard Rock;Sweet Soul Music;Folk Rock;British Invasion;Great Male Vocal Groups;and Great 'Live' Performances. Though it is approximately 100 mins. shorter than the "History... " series and does  not go past the early '70's; it is as  comprehensive and ultimately MORE ENJOYABLE!!!!
