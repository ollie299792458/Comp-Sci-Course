Hi. This is mostly in regards to the previous post by &#34;bob.&#34; You learned all of your hacking techniques from this movie, eh? I seriously hope that's sarcasm. If not, then I would believe that you're completely clueless. Honestly, this movie falls very short from having anything at all to do with &#34;hacking.&#34; This isn't exactly a movie review, for the most part. From a movie critic's point of view, I would say that it's something to watch when you're very bored. From a person interested in computer security, I would say that this movie is poison to your mind. It's about 90-95% false information. I suppose these guys are trying to be phreakers. Well, if you haven't noticed, the majority of phreaking techniques haven't worked on land based phone lines since the late 80s. Wireless/cellular is popular nowadays, however. Let's point out some absolutely idiotic parts. To start off with, they nagivate the directory structure of the boxes using a graphical file manager that FLIES in the air to what appears to be skyscrapers. These boxes are also claimed to be UNIX. History shows that pure UNIX hasn't existed since the late 60s and early 70s. It's all &#34;UNIX-like&#34; now. Some are propietary commercial OSes (AIX, HP-UX, IRIX) and some are backed by various licenses(GPL and BSD, mostly) making them open source, at least to an extent. Next point, some of the lines in the movie involve &#34;techno speak&#34; as someone previously posted, except in the context that it's completely wrong. Here's one: &#34;They're going after the kernel!&#34; I'm willing to bet that noone involved with this movie even knows much about vulnerabilities of any type, including but not limited to: stack and heap based buffer overflows, integer overflows(also including signness bugs), format string vulns, cryptography, and denial of service attacks. All this talk about copying the garbage file, being elite, hacking the planet, etc. makes me feel two different emotions. One, it's quite funny to think that someone would actually believe any of it. Two, it does anger me a bit. I've had to deal with countless people in chat rooms asking me about information dealing with this movie and others similar to it, including The Matrix. It's annoying. They're a plague that wouldn't exist had it not been for movies such as this one. &#60;sarcasm&#62;Some guys in Hollywood got rich from it, so I suppose it's okay, though.&#60;/sarcasm&#62;
