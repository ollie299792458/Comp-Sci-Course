Filmed in 1993, this film is a take- off on the Prisoner of Zenda, having many Washington insiders playing roles.Former Speaker Tip O'Neil, Alan Simpson ( famous now for Simpson Bowles Debt Commission), Former Senator Chris Doss now running MPAA, and William Pitts, a long time parliamentary master House staffer who set up the House of Representaives scene and spoke the classic "Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States."
Of course there is Kevin Klein, Ben Kingsley, S. Weaver, Ving Rhimes early great role as a secret service agent, and Charles Grodin as an outside accountant brought in to analyze the President's budget-an unforgettable scene.
It's all there inside Washington, particularly greed for power. I don't want to ruin the plot, but this is by far the best story of Washington, with biting truth  in an enjoyable comedic overlay.
Look for the insiders and others playing roles...guess who was the former judge in John Water's film, Cry Baby, or Ivan Reitman's son, now an Oscar winning director in his own right, with Juno, and others!
A must see....
