Ok so in 35 years there is still no director's cut? I've heard that this version we all know and love of easy rider is only about 40% of what was the original director's cut. If someone is going to put out a special edition, then supposing we finally see a second disk with the 3 or so hours of deleted scenes? And I mean- a director's cut movie, not just a bunch of isolated deleted scenes. Also, if you're going to add bonus soundtrack items, how about including the Hendrix tune from the movie, which I think is about the only one i remember from the movie that is not in the original movie soundtrack lp. But.. besides me wanting to know what the other 3 hours was like, this movie is all time classic independent american cinema and highly recommended to anyone over 18. It has great performances by many folks down to the louisiana locals who were used to make the movie more authentic. The trip scene was bizare for its time and arguably even for today, but very relatable, if you are 'experienced'. The scenery is absolutely stunning (watch it in WIDEscreen). And it's a great look at a country polarized by cultures and an unpopular war (sound familiar?) Buy the movie but save on the 'extras' till the 'extras' means the whole 4+ hours movie.
