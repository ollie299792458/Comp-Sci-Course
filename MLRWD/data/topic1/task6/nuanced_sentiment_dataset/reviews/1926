Beautiful scenery?  Check.  Good fight sequences?  Check.  Compelling action?  Check... sort of.  Good characters and a solid plot?  ...well, you can't have everything.

Sure, I know there was a plot.  Left-behind Viking boy saves adopted family from complete annihilation by another wave of Viking warriors.  But that's it.  That's all there was to this story.  There's no in-depth characterization.  Nothing to make you root for the good guy other than the fact that, well, he's the good guy!  No emotional connection to the characters, or between the characters.  Yes, we know they respect (and maybe even love) each other, but it doesn't come through the script or the acting.  It's simply two-dimensional.  And while the action scenes were exciting enough, getting to them felt like wading through treacle.  I spent a lot of the movie was spent with the 'all right, get on with it!' feeling.

I suppose it's fine as far as mindless action flicks go - as I said, it's very pretty to watch - but I'd rather spend my time watching *funny* mindless action movies.  My guess is, if you loved 300 (which I'd rather have watched on fast-forward, just to get most of it up to regular speed) this would be a movie for you.  But if Bad Boys is more your 'blow'em up action movie' style, give this one a miss.
