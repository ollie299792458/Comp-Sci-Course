Strikes a good balance between hilarity and the dangerous role of double agents in WWII. While some take "Basterds" as a film that glorifies violence and is disrespectful to WWII soldiers, bear in mind that this is a hyperbolic WWII revenge fantasy and does not pass itself off as anything but.

While this film requires a huge suspension of disbelief, the plot was interesting - quite a lot of little sub plots and twists to keep us guessing and Waltz's "Hans Landa" role was written and executed to perfection. The 1st scene on the farm is by far the best in the film. So much suspense written into those little cues, the analogy of the rat, the pipe... While Brad Pitt and his mangling of the italian language was the light touch on what was essentially a lonely story of a jewish girl's plan to avenge her family's murder.

A few issues that I had was that,
a)anti climatic ending - for such a fantastical film, couldn't they have done something more creative with Hitler in the cinema?
b)the characters had virtually no characterisation with maybe the exception of Shosanna
c)we don't know enough about the assasination plot. Maybe we could have been let in on more of the tactics and the attempt itself could have been a lot more exciting if Hans Landa wasn't the only intelligent Nazi in the film

Also, Novak kind of spoiled the film for me in a way that Rowan Atkinson spoiled Johnny English.
