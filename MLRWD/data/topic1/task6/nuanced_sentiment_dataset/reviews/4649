I'm a huge fan of the theatrical release of Payback.  It's one of those movies that is enjoyable every time you watch it.  Considering that, I was very interested in the "Straight Up" edition.  Yes it's the same story, told slightly different; yes it's more violent; and no, it's not as good.  The movie feels very forced at times, in several directions: the violence, the dialog, and the severe lack of humor.  What was funny in the theatrical release is dead-pan here.

About the violence, there really isn't THAT much more in the movie.  The  problem is that the violence is unexpected, unwarranted, and just brings the movie down. It's out of place and made me reminisce about how much I liked the way the original flowed.

Now, if this release included the Theatrical release in addition to all the extras, I would be giving a 5-star rating and writing a raving review.  But for me, this "new" version just doesn't cut it.

If you're really curious, rent it or buy it used.  Otherwise you'll just be disappointed.
