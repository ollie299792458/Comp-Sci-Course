I expected an exploitation flick, what with Bridgette Bardot being the Marilyn Monroe of French Cinema and all, and this film being so controversial at the time. But the director (or screenwriter) appears to have been unaware of Bardot's status as a sexpot. So, instead of Bardot's character being one who could arouse the dead, she is actually one who could send us to sleep. The movie is actually a serious drama. The screenwriter should at least have made her an interesting dramatic character.
In the film, she plays the hottest chick in the world who is also the obsession of every man in the world. As the title implies, she is the only "real" woman God ever created. But we learn nothing about her character. Sure she's attractive, but what else is it about her that is so appealing? Nor do we learn anything about the men fixated on her. Since the film is about men with a superficial attraction to this chick, then the film could at least have taken a superficial approach by being an exploitation flick, exploiting her beauty and sex-appeal, a la Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle...
