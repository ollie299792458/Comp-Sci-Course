With witty voice over narration, in a sometimes incomprehensible Scottish brogue, from Ewan Macgregor as the lead protagonist Trainspotting starts of with a delightful introduction to a motley crue of misfits. When we are introduced to these characters that make up his circle of friends, Tommy, Sick Boy, Begbie and Spud all the time moving to the sounds of Iggy Pop's catchy "Lust for life" we know we are in for a treat. The movie is a humorous, dark, cynical, satirical look at the life of a junkie and the effects of heroin on the lives of himself and his friends.

It also comes across as a social commentary piece, juxtaposing the mundane activites of everyday society with the fixed purpose of a "sincere and honest" drug habit. The movie in no way condones the use of drugs but does show the kinds of motivation that initiate it. It's very postmodern in that the movie critiques the "grandnarratives" of modern society and shows how empty and supeficial they are, even to the extent that a drug habit is more appealing than living exposed to modern-day plastic consumerism hyper reality. The superficiality of society and the norms are starkly contrasted with the real, physical, painful, purposeful life that governs and directs someone on smack!

Apart from the postmodern themes and ideas that the movie posits, at the end of the day it's just a great piece of extraordinary filmmaking with delighful exchanges, a wonderful soundtrack and a lot of jokes about Sean Connnery!

I don't want to spoil any more of the suprise so all I can do is suggest that you go out and buy this NOW! You won't regret it, however watch it with an "open-mind".
