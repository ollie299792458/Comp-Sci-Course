You don't have to be a purist to find this version of "Show Boat" pretty bad.
It's particularly unfortunate because a number of the cast members of this version were excellent choices. But the screenplay is inane, robbing the characters of any consistency whatsoever. Most of the numbers are poorly staged. Many details are wildly off, with "Life Upon the Wicked Stage" seeming to be out of another film entirely. And almost all of the songs are performed with funereal tempos.
Well-cast though most of the principals are, what perhaps sinks the film most is Kathryn Grayson's performance as Magnolia. She never really could act, but in her early films she had a certain charm. Here she's just awful, both dramatically and vocally. Listening to her sing is painful, and I'm not one of those people who have trouble listening to sopranos. I like good sopranos, but in this film Grayson's sound is shrill, her vibrato is excessive, and her phrasing is intolerably mannered. But bad as she is, even she doesn't deserve the ugly dress she's given for "After the Ball."
The best sequence in the film is the "Old Man Fiver" sequence when Julie and Steve leave. That one section is well-directed and shot, though even there the song, despite William Warfield's fine singing, is performed at a too-slow tempo.
Stick with the 1936 version. Some of it's a little primitive and rough around the edges, and the ending doesn't work, but it's vibrant and often wonderful. The only reasons why this film merits two stars instead of one is that it's hard to completely destroy the music, much of the cast does the best they can under the circumstances, and that there's a certain grisly fascination about some of the worst parts.
