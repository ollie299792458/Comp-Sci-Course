I bought the wwe championship dvd for a few matchs with Hogan because he was such a big legend when I was growing up but I was kinda upset that they only had about 4 of his matches and out of those 4 only two or 3 of them was good.  I really wished they would have included some of his World championship matches off this match I am particularly talking about his match with Slaughter which was a classic match because both men was known to be patriots at one time but at that time Slaughter was potrayed in the WWE as an anti American and Hogan was portrayed as the all American Hero still it was one of the best World Championship matches of all time.  I also see on this dvd the first match that he and Andre has together which should be classic since in that match Andre was a good guy and Hogan was a bad guy.  I only wished they would have waited a bit longer on putting out this dvd and put the match he had with Orton on it since Orton can have a good match with anyone in my opinion.  But in some ways I do wish the WWE would stop making dvds on Hogan and focus on some of the lesser known stars in the 80s like Dibase, Steamboat, and Snuka whom I'm sure Vince will have to admit helped Hogan build the WWE.
