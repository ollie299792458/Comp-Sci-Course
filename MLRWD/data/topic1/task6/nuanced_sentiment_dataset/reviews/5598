This is one of my favorite Doctor Who special episodes. I was very excited to receive this DVD. When it arrived, I opened the package to find a DVD that was most certainly used. The DVD had no security sticker, was definetly re-shrink wrapped and had a big X cut into the front of the jewel case and cover art. The excitement stopped right there! The seller wrote back quickly with terms on return, refund or a half refund and keep the item.

At this point I'm furious and I don't trust the seller so, I just want to return the DVD. Sent seller anice email stating that I will return for full refund and asked if he would pay for return shipping plus, I wanted a signature from the seller upon the return, because like I stated earlier at this point I dont trust this seller at all. The seller stated that the he would take care of it when the product arrives. He did give me a full refund on the DVD, but did not refund my return shipping.

When I asked about the return shipping cost to be refunded the seller stated that he does not pay return shipping and then mocked me because I paid 8.57 to have it returned. Paid that much because I put a return receipt on my shipping (I do not trust you)and told him I was going to! I figured that after our emails he knew my plan and what I wanted from him and he agreed to my terms. This seller is a liar, a cheat, and sells used/damaged product to people stating that they're new. BAD SELLER!! Seller is not to be trusted! BEWARE!!
