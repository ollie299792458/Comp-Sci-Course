I bought this movie as it was one of those "must haves", along with Citizen Kane (not one of my particular favorites, but again a "must have")and have watched it twice.  I watched it a second time, thinking that maybe I must have missed something the first time.  The movie left me cold and reading all these glowing reviews made me wonder, was I watching the wrong movie?  It seems obvious that casting Moira Shearer in the movie was an attempt to capitalize on The Red Shoes.  That Stella is a ballet dancer and not an opera diva is a clear departure from the opera and Shearer is totally out of place as Olympia.  The movie itself seems poorly edited, as if parts were left on the cutting room floor.  The singers, except for Rounseville, are mediocre (as another reviewer mentioned).  Even recalling this movie now is an agonizing experience.  If someone wants to see a film version of this opera, there is a film by Walter Felsenstein which is more in context with the opera itself and there's a good version with Placido Domingo and Agnes Balsta. Either of these is worth the price of admission, whereas this version is not.  I gave it two stars, one because someone took the time to make the movie and the other because its a "must have."
