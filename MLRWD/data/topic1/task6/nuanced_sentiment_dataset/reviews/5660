I have to agree with the other reviewers on this board:  Annette Bening is just stunning.  In fact, it is hard to take your eyes off of her.  Her acting in this film is extraordinary and was a pleasure to watch.  In fact, all the actors did a fabulous job in portraying their characters.

Unfortunately, I found the film to have parts that were bland and uneven.  I had to watch it in three different sittings because at times I became very bored.  The premise is that Julia Lambert, a diva of the stage, spends her entire adulthood playing a role.  She never has an original thought; everything she says is from one of her plays.  She has an affair with a much younger man who is having an affair with a young woman (in a play with Julia) who is having an affair with Julia's husband (played very well by Jeremy Irons).  The fireworks begin when Julia decides to become original for once while having her comeuppance!

BEING JULIA was a mildly entertaining film that I enjoyed viewing.  If certain scenes had been cut, I think it would have been in contention for some big awards.  Bening did win several awards (including the Golden Globe).  The costumes and sets were also wonderful and I adored the ending of this cute little movie.
