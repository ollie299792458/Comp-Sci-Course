Just to be upfront with the reader, I switched to a plant based diet about a year ago. The results were virtually immediate and noticeable. I began shedding weight and felt more energetic. There were short term side effects that I attribute to the behavioral change and my body adjusting. But enough about me...

This film is a lot to handle for someone not initiated to the plant based diet. I would discourage anyone who is purchasing this film for the entertainment value, rather I would suggest the film 'Simply Raw' instead. 'Eating' is a full-on crash course of the major reasons as to why you should consider the plant based diet. There is no sugar coating of the material, it is served up raw and quick.

For someone like myself who is continually educating themselves on this subject, I found the film to be a five-star delicacy. But I gave this film four stars to prohibit the vegan-curious from purchasing this film and point them in the direction of buying 'Eat to Live' or 'The China Study' first. Also, the entertainment aspect could be much higher (I know, I know, I will get crud for that statement but it's true).

In closing, I have watched the film twice. The first to just see the film. The second time to motivate me. Others that have seen this film feel the same way. If you ever feel the need to defend you plant based diet to someone... just hand them the film.
