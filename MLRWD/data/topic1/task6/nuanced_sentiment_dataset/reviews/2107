The first thing I noticed was that the audio was very poor, and the camera is off kilter much of the time. That pretty much set the tone for the rest of the video (at least what I made it through). Not to mention the large "Ultimate" print on the side of the screen, which is rather distracting.

As far as the workout goes, it is very fast moving with little instruction and explanation. It is difficult to follow, and having 2 years of belly dance instruction being able to follow along was the least of my worries. I can't say whether or not it is a good workout since I never actually finished it because it was simply too frustrating. I also found the music strange. The voiceover was also just weird at times, talking about your body's connection to the universe or whatever. Normally those things don't bother me, but it just seemed out of place. The attire of some of the dancers is a little strange as well; I'm not used to seeing someone do a workout video in jeans. It just feels less authentic than other videos where they wear traditional belly dancing attire.

On the plus side, many of the moves are authentic belly dance moves. I simply think there are better instructional and workout videos out there, such as Luscious Belly Dnace Workout for Beginniners, which actually features some of the people in this video as well.
