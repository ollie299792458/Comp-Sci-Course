Although Frank Tuttle's "This Gun for Hire" was released the year I was born, I hadn't seen it until my newly-purchased copy arrived last week (October 2006).  As a movie-mad, Alan Ladd-adoring child I knew about it as the pivotal point of my idol's career, but never found it screening anywhere, not even on television.

So how did it shape up?  Regrettably, not as well as I'd hoped.  First, the notion of traitorous war-time activity is too big an angle for a small film - why not a simple, grubby little motive (anything to do with sex)for blackmail?  Second, there are too many weak performances in supporting roles - not to mention 3rd-billed Laird Cregar's amateurish turn as the double-crossing Gates.

That aside, Ladd is sensational as the bitter-and-twisted Raven - no wonder the role made him a star.  What a shame his career was so badly-handled - not just by Paramount, who never gave him the vehicles (apart from "Shane") a star of his popularity deserved, but also by his none-too farsighted agent Sue (Mrs. Ladd) Carroll.  And Veronica Lake - what can one say?  Fabulous in all the few films she made (the cabaret numbers she performs in this film are total delight), it's outrageous to think her name means nothing to so many of today's movie-goers.

Shortcomings aside, I'm pleased finally to have seen and enjoyed "This Gun for Hire".
