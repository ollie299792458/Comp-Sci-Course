I am a ballroom dancer and I think this was a horrible movie due to the following reasons ...

Storyline is clich&eacute;:
- Dance prot&eacute;g&eacute; is bored with accepted dance moves and wants to invent his own moves
- Ugly duckling with two left feet becomes prodigy's new partner and becomes a beautiful graceful dancer

Dancing was not spectacular:
- The "new" moves that the protagonist does come up with is not actually new, he's just incorporating modern dance into social dance
- What little social dancing footage there is is interrupted and so we never get to see a complete dance sequence
- The social dancing that is done is expertly done but nothing worth calling home about

Costume, makeup, and hairstyles were just painful to look at:
- Too much unwarranted skin exposure (are we at the beach or on the dance floor?)
- Too gaudy (colors are loud and dissonant)
- Mohawks do no look good on women

Baz Luhrmann was not at his best in making Strictly Ballroom. You do see one good shot of the two lovers in front of a sparkling red Coca-Cola billboard and another stunning shot of the two of then dancing in front of a white curtain with pink backlighting, but other than those two shots, the rest of the cinematography was mediocre.

For a better sample of amazing work by Baz Luhrmann try Moulin Rouge or Romeo & Juliet.

Better ballroom dance films to watch are Dirty Dancing and Shall We Dansu? Make sure you get the originals and not the later versions.
