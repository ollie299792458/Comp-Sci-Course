Obviously designed to cash in on the popularity of Bram Stoker's Dracula, Frankenstein is an essay in why leading actors shouldn't try to artifically create a life for themselves as a director. Frankenstein could have been a great film - it's a fantastic story as raw material, the cast is outstanding, the sets and make-up are great and Branagh clearly had a bottomless budget - but everything tries so self consciously to be stylish that the whole artifice collapses entirely under its own weight.
The film belts along as if it is on a caffeine rush - the camera circles, pans, swoops and ascends over the action like an angel, but never once stands still - rendering the already grand gestures of the cast absurd - Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter overact like there's no tomorrow - which has the effect of converting a gothic horror into a pantomime farce.
The pity about all this is that this film does capture the point of Shelley's book in a way none other has: Robert De Niro plays the nameless monster very sympathetically and Branagh rightly treats him as the victim in all this. But the film - with its silly embellishments on the Frankenstein novel - undermines sophisticated statement.
Worth a look, but extraordinarily disappointing.
