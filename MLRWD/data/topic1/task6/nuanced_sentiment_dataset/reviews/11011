I will say this right off the bat: this movie is a disappointment. Let's start with the plot.
A young aspiring musician goes to a camp filled with other musically-inclined artists. At Camp Rock, they will harness and expand their "talents" (talents which include singing as though they will have an asthma attack any second, and thinking they can dance when they can't). The girl works part-time in the kitchen to pay for her stay, something she keeps from the other campers. At the camp, she meets a teen rocker-idol who is there for punishment (yeah, staying there would DEFINITELY be a punishment). Apparently, his attitude has gotten him into trouble with his bandmates and he needs to cool off. The girl changes the boy over the course of the movie. They fight. The girl does not win the big competition at the end of camp (didn't see that one coming. The main character doesn't win?) Girl and boy make up. The End.
Now let's talk about the music. For the most part, the music is basically rap/hip-hop. As mentioned above, the singing doesn't even make up for the terrible tunes.
If the plotline and characters had been developed a bit more, this might have been a fairly decent film. The only good parts are when all three Jonas brothers are together. They play off each other and deliver their comical lines well. Sadly, the five good minutes when they're all together do not make up for the other 85 that do not include Kevin and Nick.
Final word: skip this movie and watch High School Musical instead.
