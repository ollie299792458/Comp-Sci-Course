Honestly? this film was such a piece of crap i honestly cannot believe that anyone would release it for the public! the story was horrible, the acting was horrible and unbelieveable. Spoilers Warning- the blood dripping on the walls to wash off the symbols was such a joke. The cast is running arounf with charcol from the fireplace to rewrite the symbols as dozens of handsburst through the walls, complete CG crap! - the girl reading the symbols was so unbelieveable, she was perfectly calm and it was just silly. the dobies in the basment, lol, and no one seemed to care except furlongs character.lol what a joke. The monsters looked like Kmart halloween costumes! the special effects were terrible! amature makeup artists maybe? - OHH how about the first demon transformation!!! lol what a joke, the man is having doggiestyle sex with this chick, transformes into a demon and the women burst open with tenticles and earthworms!... This movie does not deserve 1 star to be honest. the Ending was kinda cool, well the twist was but in all honestly it was really lame! the girl pretending to hang herself, just as angelia had in the opening scene. she just ties the rope around her waist as well as her neck to prevent her death! lol seriously? how much time did she have to do this? hahaha and shes just all cool, "stupid demons" and she trotts off as people come to retreave the sound system from the house. UGH I cannot even spend anymore time talking about this film it just pisses me off. i expected in a halfway entertaining film but this was such pathetic crap i do not reccomd it to anyone! watch the 80s version of the film, its vastly superior to this piece of crap remake!
