I have a large collection of opera dvds.  Many people only prefer to purchase staged versions, but I don't mind movie versions as well.  They give you an entirely new prospective to the story...if its done well.  This production of Butterfly is one of the worst productions of ANYTHING that I have ever seen.  Once you see the opening scene, when Domingo begins running through a random field, you should brace yourself, because it only goes downhill from there. The singing is quite good, but the cinematography and the staging is absolutely attrocious.  The camera angles are just bad and the sequence from Act 2 to Act 3 (which is all done as one act in this production) looks very, very, STUPID.  The best part of this production is Butterfly's death, which leaves Pinkerton in a state of...well, you just have to see it.  That is the only promising piece of staging in the whole production.  If you want to save some money, I would not suggest buying this production unless you want to get a couple of opera friends together, and have a nice laugh...
