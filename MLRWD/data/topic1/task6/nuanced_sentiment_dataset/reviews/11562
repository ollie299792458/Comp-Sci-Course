Let me start off by saying if you haven't seen (or don't like) Herschell Gordon Lewis movies you may be a little impatient during "Blood Feast 2". Sure, it's a new movie, but this film could've been made right after 1972's 'Gore-Gore Girls' and fit in just fine. What I mean is, Lewis hasn't changed a bit, and I love him for it. Extreme gore is the raison d'etre and there's plenty of it. Many frames are just close-ups of bloody organs being fondled by a pair of hands, but there are some excellent FX as well. Like the original 'Blood Feast' there's no real plot to speak of, it's actually almost a remake. The grandson of Fuad Ramses opens a restaurant in the same town where the original murders took place, and immediately begins slaughtering women for another feast to honor a goddess. Meanwhile, a dumb cop investigates. There's more intentional humour in this one, and the endless jokes concerning the lead cop's overeating partner get tiresome. Nevertheless, I'm a huge fan and it's great to see a new film from a legendary director.
