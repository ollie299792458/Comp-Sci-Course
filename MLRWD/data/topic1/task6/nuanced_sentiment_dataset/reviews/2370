This is not an opera. It is an opera, turned into a filmed ballet (except for act 3, here the Antonia act, rather than Giuletta), with some truly excellent sets, costumes and cinematography. It should not be compared to the excellent contemporary recreations of opera on film, esp. Pournelle's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5KOJS">Mozart - Cosi fan Tutte</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3VTT8">Rossini - La Cenerentola / Frederica von Stade, Francisco Araiza, Paolo Montarsolo, Claudio Desderi, Laura Zannini, Claudio Abbado</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BB1MH8">Puccini - Tosca / Gheorghiu, Alagna, Raimondi, Muraro, Cangelosi, Pappano, Royal Opera (2000 film)</a>.

The sound quality, as other reviewers have noted is mediocre, but probably as good as can be expected. It is not remotely hi-fi.

Enjoy it for its own sake--its visual qualities are remarkable, but it should not be your primary Tales of Hoffman. If you do not enjoy ballet (I tend to fast forward when watching it in opera), then you will be disappointed. Your best bet is probably <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008DDRN">Offenbach - Les contes d'Hoffmann (The Tales of Hoffmann) / Pretre, Domingo, Royal Opera Covent Garden</a>; I very much enjoyed the Paris Opera production with Shicoff and Terfel, sadly currently out of print.
