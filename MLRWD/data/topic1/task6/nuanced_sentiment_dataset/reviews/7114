well this movie did honestly surprise me. i had the feeling it would be good, but not as good as it really was. the only thing that would have made it better is if they had gotten clint eastwood in it. oh well, you can't have everything. a great story for those who find themselves asking "who am i?" this isn't a movie that i would suggest to someone who has no sense of humor cause there are a lot of jokes in there. all good ones. i also would not recommend this movie to children under the age of 8 due to some violence and language. it's mainly gun play that plays it's part in it. the music is great. especially at one point were blue grass and classical mix. though nothing is perfect. the mystery was predictable as were some of the twists and such. but then again i've been watching movies forever. all in all i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes seeing an idiot looking like one in different ways than one and small jokes here and there. also keep an eye out for another depp movie reference. you'll know it when you see it.
