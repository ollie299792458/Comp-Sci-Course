This tape is a great way to exercise for those of us who tend to be lazy and full of excuses. You just pop it into your DVD and start moving in front of the TV. You can do it in your pajamas and it doesn't matter if you haven't showered or washed your hair yet. There's no one else watching or judging you.

The 3-mile walk takes 45 minutes, but you can do any portion of it that you want--one mile or two or all three. The middle section is quite brisk and you'll definitely sweat. You'll burn more calories than by taking a regular walk outside. (Some of the people on the tape have lost up to 100 lb on the program!) There are other moves besides plain walking to keep it interesting, and the steps are easy to follow.

I've been using this tape for several months and I really think it's perfect for me. No expensive equipment to buy or driving to and from health clubs. It's been a great investment in my health for only $8 and I feel really proud of myself every time I finish a session. (P.S. Comcast on Demand has similar Leslie Sansone walking programs that you can try for free. What have you got to lose?)
