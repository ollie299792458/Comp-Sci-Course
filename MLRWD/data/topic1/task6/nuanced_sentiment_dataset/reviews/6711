Dan Curtis should have quit with the TV series. He excelled with "Herman Wouk's Winds of War/War and Remembrance", however. I remembered seeing this originally in a movie theatre, and I was dismayed by the original film stock -- sadly resembling 8mm or 16mm -- stereo sound was also beginning to become routine in 1970 and the sound in the theatre was a little fuzzy for "HSD". The lighting was also murky. Jonathan Frid's efforts may have been top drawer, but the overall timing of character's exchanges was wooden. They were more comfortable with the feel of television production, and it showed. Dark Shadows was perfect in video soap opera format. That much was worth rushing home from school (even breaking detention, if necessary!) for.
Barnabas was the first vampire in my life that was so well portrayed, that Mr. Frid convinced me that it was possible for vampires to actually exist! Yet, through the years, Lestat replaced him as my perfect vampire hero (Thanks a few million/millenia, Anne!).
Speaking of Lestat I now understand the sequel to "Interview . . .", with Heath Ledger as the new Lestat is under production right now. Could you imagine Joanna Going ("Dark Shadows, The Revival") playing 6,000 year-old vampire Queen Akasha? I could! Robert Plant as Marius and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Pandora!!
