My family thought this movie was ok, but it really touched my heart.  Honestly, I found myself crying through this movie mainly because I believe I serve a big God.  I know alot of people might think that the circumstances in this movie are beyond belief; however, the Bible is filled with beyond belief stories.  It is also the beyond belief things and circumstances that I look for my God to do.  I have never sold cars for a living, and neither would I want to.  However, my ex-wife belonged to a family full of car dealers and my grandfather was a car lot owner at one time in my life.  I know a good car dealer from a crooked one, and I know that alot of good people who have car lots have a hard time staying honest.  The circumstances in this movie just really hit home with me.  I believe that when the Bible said taste and see that the Lord is good that it meant what it said.  I believe if you put God to the test that everything will work to your good if you are seeking after him with all your heart.  I would definitely watch this movie again, I would recommend that others see it, and if I ever have a friend struggling to make it from day to day I believe this would be a nice gift for them.  God bless all.
