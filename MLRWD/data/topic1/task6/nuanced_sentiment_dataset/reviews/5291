This Mini series is the first in the retelling of the saga of man as related to the doomed 12 Colonies. This differs from the 1977 (or 78) version is the fact you can feel the emotion the characters put forth. The shock and horror of the life you knew destroyed all around you. The cast of characters has changed as in the old version it was more a family show and this a more darker look at the characters. Adama is now a worn out leader due retirement. He has put duty over family and his Son Lee (Apollo) hold him a grudge and wants nothing at first to do with him. Starbuck is now a woman but similar to the old character except her character had authority issues. Tigh is now a drunken bitter man. Exceptional at his post but weakened by his vices. Boomer is now female as well and a cylon which can now appear as humans (why you would want to take the form of something you mortally hate escapes me.) Baltar is now a self centered womanizer and coward. He has visions of the sexy cylon 6 which uses him to set forth unknowingly the downfall of them all. Quite the soap opera set in space. Well done and basically sticks to the old format but updated , darker and full of emotion. Well done.
