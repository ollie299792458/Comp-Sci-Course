Someone had wrote in a previous review, nobody should write reviews unless they've seen the DVD.  I had wrote a previous review based on my like for season 3, but know have a few new comments in regards to the DVD.  
They changed the Dawson's Creek theme song???  Granted, every time I hear the song on the radio, I quickly change the station, it's still the theme.  I've heard everything from, it's a creative decision, to the rights for the song cost Sony an arm and leg to get.  I have a few memorable episodes of season 3 on VHS and had looked forward to finally getting rid of them when season 3 hit on DVD.  Nope!!!  Not now!!!  
The producers did change a lot of the music that flowed through each episode too.  Again, cost was one of the main issues I've heard.  That doesn't bother me so much, but the mix is really bad.  I've only seen the first 3 episodes on DVD and in those 3, it was at times difficult to hear dialog because of the poor music mix.  I haven't checked for myself, but from what others have said, they did keep Daydream Believer in which is good considering the impact the song has on the episode "Stolen Kiss".  
Granted, there are little things that have rubbed me the wrong way with this DVD, the other gripe is the loss of the recap from episode to episode.  I now it's not that big of a deal, but I liked the "previously on Daswson's Creek" recap.  I'm a major geek, so who knows.  
If you are a Creek fan, it's still worth having.  Maybe wait a while longer for the price to drop and cross your fingers they put things back on track for Season 4...probably my personal favorite.
Happy shopping Creekers.
