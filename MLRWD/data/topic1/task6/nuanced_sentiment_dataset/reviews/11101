Both Hornblower by C.S. Forester and Patric O'Brian's Capt Aubry/Maturin are the exploits of Admiral Sir Thomas Cochrane who is in this officer's opinion; is the greatest Navy officer Ever. In South Amdrica, teamed with Simon Bolivar and others, he defeated first the Spanish Navy and liberated Chile & Peru.  In these southern South American countries are numerous statues to their hero. Brazil too won freedom after Tom defeated the Portaguese Navy. However some problem with paying Tom his Prize money so no statues yet? Remeber to say thank you Brazil?

His ship was upon which Francis Scot Key wrote the Star Spangled Baner. One of the many who seemed brother to all Masons then like Washington, Bolivar, Lafayette, Von stueban, about half of the Scot-Irish half of Washington's army yet to find proof that he too was a Templar Mason? He was not very active against Americans with all their Mason leadership-Why?

We need follow up to Master & Commander of Patric O'Brian series as we have run out of  C.S. Foresters books.

Biography of Cochrane by Harvey for final proof of what has been said.
