In 1997's "Donnie Brasco", Al Pacino added another mafia film to his resume as he took Johnny Depp under his wing and taught him about ganster life, where survival of the fittest was the law of the land. Playing a character called Lefty, Al stumbles around talking about which car is better: Lincoln or Cadillac, and he says "Forget about it" about 4,000 times throughout the first 5 minutes of the movie. For once, Pacino was in the co-starring role, and I don't think he really belonged in this movie. He was probably only cast in this movie because of his image and his appearance. He is a terrific actor, but not in this one. This just wasn't the Al Pacino that we saw in "Devils Advocate" and "Dog Day Afternoon". But, Johnny Depp surprised me with his performance that seemed to fit the mold more naturally. 
The ending to the movie was very unpredictable and changed the entire context of the movie. There were some very good scenes of ganster violence within restaurants that were better than the classic's, like "Goodfellas" and "The Untouchables". But, Al Pacino's surprisingly lackluster performance did nothing to help this movie out. They should have cast Sean Penn.
