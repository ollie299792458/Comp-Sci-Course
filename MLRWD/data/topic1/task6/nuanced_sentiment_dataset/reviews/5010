If you have been living in a closet for the last 50 years this movie may actually be enlightening. "Love conquers all," has always been the easiest perspective on life to gain a consensouses on but it is also the most trite. Pretending this movie had been made 50 years ago the inter-racial relationship at the center of the story would have been provacative and the political commentary on the death penality meaningful. This movie won awards that should have gone to controversial and politically progessive films made years ago. I am convinced that guilt for not recongizing previous attempts to address these issues is the only reason "Monsters" even made it to the theaters. Halle Berry almost gave a very believable performance except for the sex scenes which were almost as bad as highlights from "Showgirls". Billy Bob Thornton remains one of my favorite actors from his performance in "Dead Man" but I have yet to see him in a good movie since. Besides the flocks of right wing dolts in the Texas and Florida there is probably no one that has anything to gain by wasting their time on this movie.
