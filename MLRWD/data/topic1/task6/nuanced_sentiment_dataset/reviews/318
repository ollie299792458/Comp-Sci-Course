I am astounded that grown adults planned this movie, financed its production, participated in its creation, and then had the shamelessness to release it.

You cannot (or, *should* not) have a "the world's climate shifts" movie without at least a tidbit of credibility in the science you present.  The key premises in A.Z. are atrocious, with glaring errors around key plot points that any seventh grade science student should detect. More than anything else, this relentless stream of impossibilities kept me agitated through the whole film.

A.Z. is certainly not the only movie along this basic concept (global warming means Miami freezes), and they all stretch reality a good bit, but I've seen episodes of Barney that make more sense than this film.

The actors are the only bright spots in Absolute Zero... decent, and occasionally downright good, performances try hard to compensate for poor direction, poor special effects, and, again, completely nonsensical science.

I wish only that Amazon would let me rate it Absolutely Zero stars.
