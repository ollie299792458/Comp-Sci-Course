Half the text should be cut out of this movie...it is poorly written, contains no suspense, and some scenes are far too long and drawn out with absolutely nothing interesting happening...the characters are mostly poorly developed with very little personality, the sexual tension is virtually non-existant, the major twists in the plot are not explained fully, which makes for disjointed viewing, and apart from the ending there is nothing particularly interesting or new about the movie from either a science fiction or a special effects perspective.  Watching frog guts for half the movie just does not cut it in terms of interesting science fiction-in fact it seems totally unrealistic that the entire game system is made of flesh and guts...finally, the part that annoyed me the most was when "Pikul" asks why the "bioports" in the spinal column don't get infected because "they open straight into your body", and Jennifer Jason Leigh says "don't be ridiculous, listen to what you're saying" and then opens her mouth. The mouth is not "opening" straight into the human body as would a hole directly into flesh, organs, or the spine, in fact the entire digestive column can be considered as an entirely separate hollow tube inside of the body, with membranes to control what passes in and out of what is actually part of the human body.  I found this movie was a waste of my time and just plain annoying.
