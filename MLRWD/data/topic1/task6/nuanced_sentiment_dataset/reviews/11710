You see folks, when this movie came out I was a kid so naturally being in my mid twenties now I wanted to have another look at it. I was shopping a few weeks ago and picked it up in a bargain bin at a local shopping center. I got home and watched it. It was more horrible than I remembered. 
I suddenly remembered that I didn't enjoy it when it came out. The duck is so annoying you want to roast him and drizzle red-wine sauce over his corpse and chow down. Lea Thompson is a pretty good actress but this is no star vehicle for her. Jeff Jones is the only good cast member and that only happens after he turns into a demon from outer space. The only sequence I liked was the one in the diner when Jeff Jones freaks out. The rest is pretty bad. Zero folks. But Amazon does not have that star system. They need to for movies like this!
