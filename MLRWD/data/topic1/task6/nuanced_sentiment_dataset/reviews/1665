I was very excited to try this DVD.  I do a routine of classic pilates and cardio, so I thought this would be a good DVD to add to the collection.  The opening 30 mins is classic pilates, but done very slowly, with no real instruction or tips or modifications to keep yourself safe (such as not to let your back come off the mat, or bend your knees if you can't stretch that far, etc) and moves too advanced for beginners (I don't know too many beginners who can master the teaser on the 1st try).  Also, it's not a full pilates routine, just the exercises she likes.

The "cardio" segment is too short (18 mins) and very repetetive.  She also does not keep time with the music, doesn't tell you how many to do of each exercise and gives no real instruction on how to do the moves.  Watching her march is also very annoying, I don't know anyone who looks like that when they march.  Another annoying thing is the fact that she constantly says "belly" instead of "abs" or "abdominals", also "tush" instead of "buns" or "butt" or "buttocks".  Just a personal preference, but it annoyed me.  I'm glad I just rented this and did not waste money on a purchase.
