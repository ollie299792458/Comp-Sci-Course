Wow! What a fun movie! Now mind you, Charlie's Angels has the emotional depth of a mud puddle but it's an action extravangaza. It's like the Matrix on estrogen. Drew Barrymore, Camron Diaz and Lucy Liu are beautifuly(in more ways than one) cast as the Angels. Bill Murry is also perfectly cast as Bosley. The movie starts out with a James Bond style action opening that is very cool but a little hard to believe. This sets the style and pace for the rest of the movie. The plot is a little flimsy and the action scence are way over the top but the punches and the laughs come so fast and so furiously that you don't care. I also like the fact the no one Angel gets the focus of the film. Screen time is well split up between all three Angels and Bosley.(Though the sumo suit wrestling sceen between Bill Murry and Tim Curry is one of the funniest sceens I've seen in years). The entire cast seems to be having a ball making this film and is shows in their performances. Charlie's Angels is a must have for any movie collection.
