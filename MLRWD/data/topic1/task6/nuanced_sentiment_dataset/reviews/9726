I agree with Ray, no laugh tracks sure jump out at you. I have 3 from disc 1 with no canned laughter and it makes the scenes seem very flat(even though they're classics). Thinking about returning season 4, but I have waited a long time for these. Maybe Paramount will do the right thing and recall these and do it right next time.

Update:I returned my set then ordered it again.. Why? because I have waited so long for this series to come out that I'm going to accept this season 4 without laugh tracks, thank you Paramount for nothing. You kinda forced me into this because I own all the other seasons and have pre-ordered season 5 so what good would this be without season 4, I'm not laughing

update:to all those that think the missing laugh tracks are no big deal, first no I don't need to be told when to laugh that is not what this is about! If you allow this then what next? Missing dialogues? I know these episodes word for word (as it appears so do others) so I guess it would be ok if Paramount left out some of the dialogue "after all" we all know these episodes line by line. So go ahead and encourage poor products to be produced. If it was an option like MASH then so be it, you had a choice but this wasn't this was poor production of a classic that encluded laugh tracks! Shows that didn't use laugh as mention in other reviews well dah! How can you miss something that wasn't there, the laugh tracks however were on these but now they are not = poor production. And finally yes there were only 4 episodes BUT pretty much all on one disc, do the math poor production. Good Night and Good Luck
  UPDATE:5/11/06 Paramount has released a corrected copy of season 4 with laugh tracks way to go Paramount Thank You. And now I will purchase season 6, 7, and 8. And Season 4 deserves 5 stars *****
