Since I first saw Enchanted April in the theater, it has always had the power to take me away on this enchanted vacation along with the actors. Few movies feel like they are restoreing you soul and this movie is the very best at reminding you that life itself is the adventure and everyting else we add to it is the cream.

Four ladies at different points in their lives are the unlikely sharers of a month by the sea in a castle in Italy. They are all at crossroads in life and somehow this beautiful place gives then the time they need to sort out what is really important in life.

As one actor say, getting on with your loving is the most important thing. For two that is a rekindling of their love for their selves and their husbands, for one it is to rejoin the living and enjoy what time she has left and for the last it is just to be brave enough to stop mourning a lost love and begin to love again.

This movie has been a long time coming to US Format DVD but it has been well worth the wait. May this movie spread its enchantment on you from time to time. Enjoy !!!
