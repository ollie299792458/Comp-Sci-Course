I made the mistake of watching this movie on the same night as I'd watched "The Road," another post-apocalyptic (but even more relentlessly dismal) "thriller."  By the end of the night, suicide would have been a step UP.

The premise of this film is that the populace of some unidentified (but vaguely Socialistic, government-controlled) country, mysteriously begins to go blind. (This has been done; anybody out there see the campy "Day of the Triffids"?  Wish I'd been watching THAT...  By the end of this movie, I LONGED for shuffling, carnivorous plants.)

Initial human reactions are frankly unbelievable: If you went suddenly blind, would you allow a stranger to take the wheel of your own car & drive you home? And where was any concern or empathy evidenced, by this man's wife?

The growing numbers of the blind are "quarantined" (with appropriate government double-speak, like "You will be forcibly corrected" instead of "We will shoot you" -- very PC/liberal, hello)...  And as this captive society devolves, a very "Lord of the Flies" scenario ensues. This was interesting, and actually more believable than the psychologies shown in the initial scenes. (I had the impression those scenes were rushed through, in order to get to the grittier/meatier stuff.)  Julianne Moore is believable as the only sighted person in this Kingdom of the Blind.

The final scene endeavors to encourage. SPOILER ALERT: The captives are freed; and the man who'd first gone blind, is the first to recover his sight. One assumes (as credits roll) that the rest will follow.

Interesting, but not worth viewing a second time. I recommend watching it with some happier movie as a chaser.
