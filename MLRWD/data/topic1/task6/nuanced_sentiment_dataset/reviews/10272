Stephan J. Gould called the Cambrian Explosion the most remarkable and puzzling event in the history of life.

This video shows you why it was so remarkable by using computer animation to re-create life forms that are stranger than fiction. The video makes extensive use of the worlds leading experts on the Cambrian from Cambridge University. Their insights alone are worth the price of the video.

The mystery unveiled in the video is that the creatures fossilized in the Cambrian are very complex life forms. Yet, the pre-Cambrian rock does not contain any transitional forms to these life forms. That is why it is called the Cambrian Explosion, it was an explosion of life that appeared within a range of 2 to 5 million years, without transition from simpler life forms.

Chinese scientists studying the Cambrian fossils are looking at their origin from a non-Darwinian perspective as transitional life forms are simply non-existent.

The video animation, video quality, narration, ability to hold the interest of the viewer are all superb. I enjoyed this video immensely.
