What a shame. I just watched this and felt very disapointed. Dont get me wrong this film could and should have been a great horror film. Unfortunatly the shaky camera ruins the whole film. I dont mean Blair witch shaky, I mean for the first time watching a film, I felt motion sickness. Some people have complained about how dark the film was but I belive that the darkness of the film would not have been as big a problem if they held the camera still. I really dont get it there was not even a reason for that kind of shonky camera work. most of the films that do this sort of thing are filmed in a first person perspective, justifying the shaky camera. However this film was not shot that way, so why shake the camera so much? maybe just to frustrate the audiance? good move guys.

however the film is not a complete waste the first twenty minutes or so are really good and spooky,on the streangth of those twenty minutes you keep watching even when the movie falls of the rails. had it not been for the shaky camera I would have given this film five stars. What a shame.
