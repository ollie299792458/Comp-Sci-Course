I have the "Live in Paris" DVD, well authored with DTS sound (lossy) and very good standard definition video. It is one of my favorites. So, I was thrilled to see a Diana Krall performance on BluRay expecting outstanding video and lossless HD audio from the format. I was disappointed.

But why?

It is interesting that she confesses to her Rio audience that she was introduced to Nat King Cole vocals when she was 15 years of age, a jazz pianist but "not yet singing". She seemed tired. Maybe it was the end of the tour. Maybe the lossless audio exposed Diana Krall's lack of vocal range.

Maybe I found the noisy video, particularly when panning the audience, off-putting. A bright spot her, however, the street scenes of Rio interspersed with the concert video were much better than the street scenes on the Live in Paris disc. The latter seemed to have been shot with a vintage 8mm camera.

Maybe I was dissatisfied with how the Rio Orchestra paled by comparison to the Paris Orchestra.

Or, maybe, aside from a slight change in the play-list--The BOY from Ipanema; what's that about?--the entire production seemed like the sequel to a very good movie. Here, nothing was fresh.

In summary, let me paraphrase dialogue from Casablanca, "We'll always have Paris". ***
