I bought this sight unseen because I'm a fan of Hammer Horror, but always preferred the Dracula and Mummy movies to the Frankenstein ones.  Everybody here said that this was a great classic film and with Cushing in his prime, how could it not be?  Well, it didn't work for me.  I think my problem with it is simple.  Nothing really happens.  When Cushing is not on screen, the movie loses so much of its drive and the side characters aren't all that compelling to me as they feel like the most generic of all Hammer extras.  On top of that, you can feel the lack of a budget as it feels like most of the movie takes place in the same three or four rooms and nowhere else and the monster makeup looks bad.

The only reason I didn't give this one star is because Cushing is great, especially with his subtle reaction to the entrance of the monster during the recital.  He's always in control but he allows himself the briefest moment of panic.  Also, the ending is crazy and Cushing is game for that, the final scene being one of the best in the series.
