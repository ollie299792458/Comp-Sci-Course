I won't speak for the book because I haven't read it, and I'm not French.  If I was French, however, I imagine that I might feel insulted.  The movie seems to scream at the viewer that the French are evil, gauche, and utterly frivolous, while Americans are victims, innocent and pure.  While neither can be the case, it is ridiculous to taut such views.  
The characters in the movie as well as their interactions, comings and goings make no sense.  No one has a reason for doing what they do or going where they go.  Kate Hudson's character falls in love with two men that she barely knows and is in no way a support to her sister whose French husband mysteriously runs off with a Russian woman.  The evil French husband then does all he can to be utterly unfair to poor Roxy (his wife).  He wants to take her children, her family's painting, ie everything he can for reasons that the movie does not go into.
What bothers me more than ridiculous people doing ridiculous things for ridiculous reasons is when movie writers have cardboard cutout people do ridiculous things for reasons that are kept hidden from us.  From the scene where Kate Hudson gets a strange haircut for seemingly no reason, I simply lost interest in the story.  
Also, the writers were trying to elicit emotions where their wasn't sufficient development for there to be any.  Examples were the murder of the cheating husband and his girlfriend, the selling of the painting, the suicide of Roxy, the mad gun battle on the Eiffel Tower, etc. Need I go on?  Save your time and your money.
