Gaaa...I really wanted this movie to be good. I love Doom period. I, II or III, I simply love the whole Doom vibe. I expected this movie to be modeled on Doom 3. I like The Rock and Karl Urban. I really expected this movie to be true to the game. Not even vaguely. I would have thought with Doom III just completed, they could have used the game animations as a guide and simply do the CG route. I would never have expected animatronics and a totally different and unrelated plot. I have a lot of beefs with this movie and not much on likes. The famed "FPS" shot sequence would have been cool if the monsters had tried to actually kill Karl Urban but no, they were like the local haunted house players, careful not to touch him as he made his way through the touch less gauntlet. The Monsters are people mutated and gone bad using long dead "humanoid" DNA in nefarious experiments on condemned prisoners. Absolutely nothing to do with accidentally opening a portal to hell- NOTHING like the game... and there in lies my anger. The game was a better movie than the movie. The Rock's performance seems rushed and stereotypical and somehow he was poorly cast for this part. Karl Urban and his subtle, sullen character fits in well with the part but it's like a pale leftover performance from Riddick. All in all, I can find somthing in most Sci-Fi movies but this one is the biggest turkey to date. Save your money. Buy Aliens and get a better job of the same plot devices.
