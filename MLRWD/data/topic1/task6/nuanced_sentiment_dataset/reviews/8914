Plot in a nutshell - at the beginning of the 20th century, Russia is thrown into chaos when Czar Nicholas and most of his family is killed thanks to a curse by the evil "sorcerer" Rasputin (voice of Christopher Lloyd), but one daughter, Anastasia (voiced by Kirsten Dunst as a child), manages to survive, for better or worse, but with amnesia. Years later, the adult Anastasia (voiced by Meg Ryan, once of one of Hollywood's most sought after actresses, her career now in a state of severe disrepair thanks to her much over publicized fling with Russell Crowe), known only as Anya, is released from a Russian orphanage with no memory of her past, her only clue being a necklace with an intimate message written on it that indicates Paris as a place of importance. In trying to get to Paris, she falls in with two charmingly lovable scoundrels, Dmitri (voice of John Cusack) and Vlad (Kelsey Grammar); the two con-men intend to present an "Anastasia" lookalike to the Duchess (voice of Angela Lansbury), the last surviving member of the Royal Family, who is holding meetings with girls claiming to be Anastasia in hopes of finding the real one so that they can get the reward money she's offering. Initially unaware that Anya is the real Anastasia but merely assuming that she is an uncanny lookalike, Dmitri & Vlad decide to clean Anya up and present her to the Duchess. Along the way, long buried secrets are revealed and unexpected feelings arise as the nearly dead Rasputin and his bat sidekick Bartok try to destroy the trio.

Beautifully animated feature courtesy of Don Bluth, you'd almost swear this was one of the great Disney features. Strong animation is complimented by competent voice acting by the big stars, notably Meg Ryan throwing out her perkiest voice possible. Historically inaccurate, but who cares?
