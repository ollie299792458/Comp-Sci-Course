It is clear from the opening scene that Scorpion King aspires to be little more than a historic version of WWE Smackdown.  The plot centers around Mathayus (played by The Rock), an impeccably chiseled Armenian warrior, and Memnon, a warlord slowly conquering the land.  Memnon holds prisoner what every sinister ruler needs, a sorceress.  With the ability to predict the future, she serves as the main source of his power, also  fulfilling the action flick quota of one scantily-clad maiden in distress, making her first appearance in a weird cape and the number one apparel choice for women in 3200 BC: the halter top.

Mathayus swears revenge on Memnon because, why else, he killed his brother, and spends most of the movie falling in love with the sorceress and body slamming everyone else.  Along the way he decides his second purpose is to free and unite and nomadic tribes, keeping some shred of historical value in the story.

Teaming up with a tribal king and his band of Amazon warriors, the plot culminates as Mathayus finally comes up against his nemesis in a battle to the death. And if you were thinking that because of the ancient setting you would be free of the typical fiery pyrotechnics ending, you were wrong.  Yes, gunpowder was actually invented before the pyramids.  
Despite a lacking script and ridiculous plot, the film has decent action and special effects.  The Rock actually comes off well onscreen and his bantering lines with the comic relief character make it mildly amusing.  Basically though, the main draw is watching The Rock kick butt.  Did we really expect more?
