This  sitcom  series is absolutely delightful.  It  embodies all the  fun  and  excitement that  young  people  crave  for,  but  excludes  the  sexual  explicit  material  and  tasteless  humor  which  are the  prevalent  elements included in so many of now  days  sitcoms.  Most  shows  end  up  even with a moral lesson,  which  Gidget  herself presents so  well,  often in  delightful,  amusing  manner,  but  not  stripping  it  of  value  by  frivolousness, which  also is  prevalent in modern  sitcoms.  Those  shows appear  surprisingly modern,  with  no  lacking  of  action and  witty  situations,  and  frankly,  the  only  difference  is  that the  characters  don't  walk  around  with  cell phones  glued to  their ears,  the  cars  are  different looking and  their  wardrobe differs.  The young  Sally  Fields  makes  worth  every minute of  your  time spent  watching them.  I am  recommending them  to all my family  with young teens,  and  only regret  I have  that  there  were not  more series  of  Gidget.  It  is  absolutely  wonderful, and  I hope  many  people  read  this  review, because  I mean every word of  it. On scale  1 to 10 Gidget  with  Sally  Field  is #10.
