This review is not about The Nightmare Before Christmas.  I  am sure it is a wonderful movie by itself. Although, to me in looked very dated.
I have a great 3D TV.  Every single movie I have ordered in 3D has been amazingly beautiful to watch.  Except for this one.  I know it cannot  be the 3D
or my TV  because the minute it started the menu that says play just popped out of my screen perfectly.
There were two choices  play in 3D and play in 2D.  I chose 3D.  But the movie looked flat flat flat.  There was nothing about it that looked like 3D.
I am wondering now, as I write this if somehow I thought I chose 3D but did not move the chooser to 3D.  But then why would the menu look so 3D.
Please, others of you with the move,  does it look very flat to you too?  Was it a mistake with my DVD player not moving the chooser to play 3D correctly.
My stupidity?  Does this movie really  play in full dimensional very noticeable 3D. Because I tried 3 times and each time I could not see the 3D at all.  And
I have tons and tons of 3D movies. And always can see the dimensionality perfectly.  I returned it because of this problem i had viewing it. But would gladly
repurchase if you tell me I just did not get it to play properly.  I want to know if this movie really pops out like all 3D movies do and matches the quality of
the menu before the movie plays. I'd appreciate your help.  I wanted to love this so much.  Was I just careless and not viewing it right?  I did try a couple of times
and thought I chose 3D version.  Thanks in advance for your help  and kindness.  Thanks so much.  I gave it four stars for the movie. And left one star for the
3D so far.  :)
