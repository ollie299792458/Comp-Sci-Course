Noel played on TNT last night, and it was a pretty decent Christmas movie. Not groundbreaking, not classic, but enjoyable and life-affirming in just the way Christmas movies are meant to be.

Flexplay, however, is NOT life affirming. It just another manifestation of our disposable society, where "convenience" is king and the waste we leave is a secondary consideration, when it is considered at all. It will by its very nature create more waste, both in the useless-after-48-hours discs and the packaging these come in. Even assuming these were biodegradable, this would still assume an active role in recycling on the part of the consumer-which is nice if the buyer chooses to recycle, but this cannot be relied upon.

Moreover, Flexplay is simply unneccessary. For those who value convenience, Netflix and Blockbuster online deliver, more cheaply and with about as simple means of delivery and return as one might imagine. Don't want to drive to the store? No problem. Don't want late fees? There aren't any. And the discs are reusable.

If you want to see Noel, I'm sure it will play on TNT again and again during this holiday season. But with several major studios considering development for disposable discs, we have to send the message early that we don't want this wasteful product.
