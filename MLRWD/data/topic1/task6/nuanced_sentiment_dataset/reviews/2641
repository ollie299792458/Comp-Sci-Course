This is fantastic film, let down by a really poor audio track.  Part of this is my fault for not noticing that this DVD is Dolby Surround 2.0 and NOT Dolby Digital 5.1.  WHY!!! the boxed set with Runaway Bride WAS Dolby Digital 5.1 and great quality, unfortunately it was sold out before I got a chance to get a copy.  In addition the sound level on the Audio is at least 50% lower than any other DVD I have and very thin in quality with little bass.
As for the movie itself I was expecting an uncut original version of the Film as nowhere did it indicate that the 10th Anniversary edition had been changed from the original.  Imagine my surprise when the the introduction says that the film has been modified from the original version and has been edited for content, again WHY!!! the boxed set wasn't.
My advice is save your money for a better release than this 10th Anniversary edition.  If you can find a source of the boxed set with Runaway Bride snap it up and save me a copy while you are about it.  The boxed set was brilliant and I wish I had been quicker to buy it...
