Short Attention Span Summary:

1. Frank Lucas works for the chief black gangster in Harlem. Chief gangster dies, and Frank works his way up to the chief position.

2. He goes to Vietnam and establishes a rapport with direct producers of heroin.

3. As a result of the purity of his product, he is able to undercut the competitors and take over a very large section of the drug trade in New York and New Jersey.

4. Many cops are on the take, but there is one honest cop who gets chosen to head a task force to take down the drug trade.

5. The drug empire duly collapses and it is found out that 3/4 of the cops in the New York DEA were on the take.

Comments:

1. This is an excellent film. The attention to detail was just great (the costumes and whole way of recreating the period of the 70s).

2. The soundtrack was also very good.

3. The black accents in this film (of the characters who were not black) were laughable. Do you know anyone who talks that way? I don't.

4. It was also interesting that the movie listed Chiang Kai Shek's KMT (Kuomintang) was in Thailand (??).

5. One also wonders: If Frank Lucas killed people, why didn't he end up getting put in prison for the murders as well as the drugs? One of the murders he did was in broad daylight in front of God and anyone else who cared to look. Was he really that cool that no one would notice?

Overall, this was well worth the price of a new DVD.
