First, the negatives:  The film was too long, (2 hours, 20 minutes) trying to pack way too much material into a life story of many individual stories, each of which was interesting in themselves. Barney's personality problems are chillingly similar to those of a man with a borderline personality disorder, a man without a solid internal sense of his worth, and seriously lacking self-regulation of his overwhelming impulses.  Very few partners, unless they are compromised themselves, would stay with this type of disorder. It is just too hard to live with.  The positives: the acting of the entire cast was superb.  The desperate love that Barney felt was believable, as was the tender love his wife, Miriam, displayed for him - much as an incredibly compassionate person is drawn to a shaggy, but well meaning puppy who does just about everything wrong.  The tragic end of life illness that comes into the picture seems to redeem Barney's past behaviors in some sad way, not that that's especially gratifying. The movie, however, held my interest throughout. Dustin Hoffman's role as Izzy, Barney's father, was a gem.  There's an unusual scene that only the closest of fathers and sons would understand. Note the smile on Izzy's face. The script has some great lines.  I especially like when Miriam told Barney she wants to go back to work for personal fulfillment, now that the kids are going off to college.  She added sweetly, and (let's face it) "you're about as grown up as you're going to get".  On a personal note, I have to say that the character of Miriam (and I have not read the book by Richler) feels to me to be an entirely male created fiction of a female angel who never, never lets him down - in any way.  Please.
