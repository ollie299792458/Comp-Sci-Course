First off, I am a major fan of the band. FALLEN is one of my all time favorite albums.. Now, my review after owning this since the first day of release... At this price, it is a steal.. at the original price I paid a couple of years ago, it was still a deal.. But in my opinion -- when you buy this, throw out the CD.. the mix is horrible! Same concert on the DVD, but there is no doubt when you listen, they are different mixes. The DVD is much cleaner and distinct. The CD hurts to listen to. The performance deserved much more on the CD than it was given. When I bought it, I took it back because I thought the CD was defective! Got another then. But as I soon learned, it suffers horrible from the compression. The band is so powerful, and the drummer is amazing, but everything is bound together so tightly that nothing stands out in the mix. Vocals are buried. My advice is to buy this and just listen to the DVD. It is incredible.. but shame on the person or persons who let this go out with such a horrible CD version (why didn't you just use the same mix for both?) I give this 4 stars instead of 5 for the crappy CD.. BUT BUY THIS!!!
