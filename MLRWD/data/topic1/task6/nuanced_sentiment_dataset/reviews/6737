With Hackman and Freeman as stars (and Executive Producers, no less), expectations are high that this will be a well-acted and tense piece of work.  
Instead, two minutes into the film the dialogue has already announced itself as painfully stiff.  The film is utterly devoid of the twists and turns that make a thriller, thrilling.  
Hackman's anger at being accused, ebbs and flows for no known reason. Freeman's dignity is undermined by inane writing. And his overeager detective-sidekick is pure characature.  The only clues are completely spelled out and since the ending is in no way foreshadowed--even in retrospect--you feel completely manipulated.  In fact, the only reason I continued to sit through the movie was in hopes that the ending would redeem what came before. It surely didn't.
The direction, where someone's idea of art was to sporadically overlay the interrogation into the scenes of the crime, just made the lunacy more vivid.
Even in a time of bad movies, this one takes the cake.  That it didn't see much theater time suggests it is possible to reach a low beyond which distributors won't go.
I'd love to know why Freeman and Hackman attached their names as actors and executive producers to this total fiasco, and if I can't get back the $3.75 I paid to rent it, perhaps this at least serves as fair warning to others.
