This is the original film  made in 1960.  That was shoot in 2 half days at a very low budgets.  It made penuts compared to the 80s versions.  There are some major changes in the orginal.  Seymor is not an orphan.  It he is not a love struck geek nerd in this one.  Unlike in the remake and the play  non of the main characters other than Seymor and the Dentist get  eatten.  There are some miner characters that get eaten.  I gave it a three because some parts of it were kind of cheesy.

The part when Seymor feed the railway cop to audrey junior the body parts look so fake.  There also is  a cheesy scene near the very end when seymor berates the planet and refuses to feed it.  The plant then  manages to hypnotize semmyor and send him out to get food.  Abother chesy scene when  Seymor kills a hocker by throwing a rock up in the air.  It lands on her head andd kills her.  The end was okey.  It would have been better if they had played the song Don't Feed the planets at the end form the Album and the off Broadway play version.  I am  big fan of Godzilla I think it would have been cool if they had put the incomplete sequence on here that was shoot a while a go of the planets destroying New York.  If  you  like cheesy horror movies you will love the Original little shop of horros.  Jack Niclson is not the main character he has a minor rule in the film as a patient that arrives at the dentist office shorly after Seymor kills the Dentist. If you want to she the Dentist better protrayed I suggest you she the remake with Rick Morransis.
