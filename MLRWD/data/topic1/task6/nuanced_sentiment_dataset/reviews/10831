Michael Douglas, Annette Bening, Martin Sheen, Michael J. Fox, and Directed by Rob Reiner! It just doesn't get much better than this.

This is a smart movie and I like smart movies. The dialog is what makes this movie work and the casting is perfect. Yes this is a liberal movie and I amd a conservative republican. Nothing in this movie came close to changing my political stance, on the contrary it was so blaitent it was funny. But the love story is good, the story flows well from beginning to end, and the politics of the office are exposed an interesting. The only thing I would have hoped for is they didn't jump into the sack so easily. It also never made sense to me that the American public would turn against a president who had lost his wife and was finding a new companion after a sufficient waiting period. In fact I think the president's ratings would actually improve, but that wouldn't have lent itself to the story line so I accept this twist.

Directors can make or break a movie. Rob Reiner is one of the best directors in the business in my opinion. May he stay a director and out of politics forever!
