What a shallow, jivey take on the heyday of black pop crossover.  We've seen it all before, done with just as much disregard for pop history and music similarly mediocre.  I'm thankful that Jennifer Hudson fever has passed. Correction, she sings horribly in a new series of Weight Watchers ads in which it seems each syllable has been edited and even that can't fix the shrill, constipated performance.  She's a run-of-the-mill, overheated, overrated faxed-in diva.

Unacceptibly poorly lip-synched, the forgettable, mediocre music is fake early 70's soul cheese/Broadway maudlin, yet the plot - show bizness back-stabbing, Cadillacs, cliched cash-accumulation montages, sundry pimpy stuff and of course, Negroes dopin' it up - seems set, judging by all the cultural references, vintage cars, riots, MLK, at the rise of the Supremes in the 60's.  I do like Eddie Murphy's slippery, egotistical character but his instant transformation into James Brown was absurd.

Will Hollywood ever stop making movies like this?  Apparently not as long as people have short-memories and are swayed by relentless media-hype.  This is dreck. Have you forgotten about it yet? This is "soul" jive for white people, Simon Cowell and Hollywood tinkling on us all for cash.  It has nothing to do with the Supremes, or anything real for that matter. I wanted to like it, having heard so many raves from the professional critics, but I should have known better.  When one-word reviews like "magnificent" and "stunning" are all you hear, you're hearing the voices of shills whose highest aspirations are to get their banalities on TV so maybe they can get famous too.
