How far would you go for love and how much would you sacrifice?  These are the central points in this story.  The film is a period piece, set in 19th century Cuba.  A time when men were chivalrous and women were, well, powerless...or so we would think.  Luis Vargas (Banderas) is a wealthy coffee merchant who sends away for a wife.  All he knows of his wife to be, is from her letters.  When he finally meets her, he is shocked and then mesmerized by Julia's (Jolie) beauty and her apparent sexuality.  They are wed on the day they meet and Luis's life, as he knows it, is never the same again.  
This film could have easily turned into a cheap melodrama, were it not for the skill and smoldering sex appeal of Banderas and Jolie.  While the viewer must suspend some disbelief as the plot twists and turns (especially at the end), and while parts of the movie are predictable, the story somehow still remains intriguing and viable.  
This film is visually pleasing and the musical score is simply beautiful.  Unfortunately, the DVD leaves a bit to be desired.  The special features menu includes only choices between different languages.  
In any case, this is simply a fantasy love story, nothing more, nothing less.
