Its such a shame. The original director. Denis Hoper. In a god awful movie. The original consisted of real horror compenents, this seems to have lost them all. There is no fear nor realism evident from the original here. The filmmaking is done from a compeltly different stand point and the documentry style is gone. So is the horror. This movie can actually make you dislike the original. Thats how bad it is. And thats a classic! This movie shouldn't even be viewed. And even if you do have a "thing" for the terrible film, the DVD transfer isn't so impressive. And it has a lackluster amount of special features. Mixing comedy with horror can be good. As with Evil dead 2 as a previous reviewer said. But the comedy should be in a black, mature sense and not a goofy teletubbie sense a shown here. I cannot say enough bad things about this film. Please do yourself a favor and buy the special edition dvd of the original soon to come out, and don't waste your money on this. The introduction to the orignal said, a tradegy. The second one is a catastrophe, in a literal sense. STAY AWAY.
