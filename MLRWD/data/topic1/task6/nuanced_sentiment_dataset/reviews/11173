As an admitted Gackt fan, I first became aware of this movie while hunting through translations of his lyrics. A quick, fangirlish squeel later, I discovered to my delight (after some serious hunting) that the movie was rentable from most Hollywood Video stores. So, two days later, I was finally stated... but then I had to return it. Curses. I don't know if I'll buy the movie from Amazon, but I will be seeking it out for my collection.

But about the movie itself.

 Costumes: Can't say enough about the costumes. You'd have to see it to understand it. Missed 80% of the plot the first time just staring at it. x.x

 Script: More cheesily wonderful lines than you can shake a stick at in the humor parts, and almost tear-jerking in the stretches of story development. The little song that they sing at the end is an actual duet available on Gackt's Crescent album. *shameless promotion*

Personal Plot: Truely touching character interaction. Tons of Angst.

 Overall Plot: Well, it's classic asian mafia racialy-spawned tragidy... And there just happens to be a vampire in it.
