I watched this film with my mother last night, and several times during it I was moved to tears.  Wow, this is no ordinary TV movie! Thank you to everyone for making such a profoundly moving two hours! This is a healing journey well worth taking.

The foundation of the movie is the wonderful book by Mitch Albom, and thanks to the lucky stars in heaven, Mr. Albom's involvement in the script and some exemplary acting, the movie is as creative and lovely as the book!  You experience an entire life:  a childhood with troubled parents, emotionally-rending WWII service, a bittersweet romance which cannot produce children, final fading days of old age and "wondering what it was all for".  Then... enter Eternity (one of the most beautiful and involving "Eternity"s I've seen depicted on film) and find out the preciousness of what it all meant... and that "death" is the beginning of more life.

I think there is excellent, understated acting here. Delicious colors, whimsical sets and costumes. Instead of taking a more superficial, platitudinous route, which other films and books have (including, in my opinion, The Christmas Box), this movie grabs hold of the deepest parts of you and refuses to let go. It may not be suitable for children in that the emotional intensity at times is very powerful. For everyone else, I would say... please see it! It is simply beautiful.
