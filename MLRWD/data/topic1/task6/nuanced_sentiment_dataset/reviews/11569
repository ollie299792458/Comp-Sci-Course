IT IS SAD THAT DISNEY HAS BECOME THE MULTIZILLION DOLLAR INSTITUTION THAT IT HAS.  IF IT WAS STILL UNDER THE WATCHFUL CARING EYES OF WALT DISNEY HIMSELF, I DON'T THINK THE DVD VERSION OF THIS MOVIE I JUST PURCHASED WOULD  BE THE SAME.  THE MOVIE OF COURSE IS AS GREAT AS IT ALWAYS WAS - A WONDER  OF ARTISTRY &amp; FANTASY SEAMLESSLY BLENDED TOGETHER. THE COLORS ARE AS  BEAUTIFUL AS EVER.  THE SOUND IS O.K., BUT I WOULD THINK THAT DISNEY COULD  DO SOMETHING IN THE WAY OF RESTORATION AS FAR AS THE HISS THAT IS VERY  NOTICEABLE - ESPECIALLY IN THE LOUDER PASSAGES.  
I ALSO AM NO DUMMY WHEN  IT COMES TO GENERAL DVD KNOWLEDGE, BUT I WAS TOTALLY CONFUSED LOOKING AT  THE BACK OF THE DVD CASE AS TO WHETHER THIS MOVIE WAS A WIDESCREEN VERSION  OR FULL SCREEN.  IT CLEARLY STATES IN MINISCULE LETTERS UNDER THE RUNNING  TIME THAT PETER PAN IS PRESENTED IN ITS ORIGINAL THEATRICAL ASPECT RATIO,  APPROX. 1.33:1. I (AND PROBABLY ANYONE ELSE BESIDES ROGER EBERT) WOULD  GUESS THAT THIS MEANS IT APPEARS AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY SHOWN IN THEATRES -  WIDESCREEN!  I WAS MORE THAN TICKED TO FIND LATER THAT IT IS IN FACT A PAN  AND SCAN VERSION, AND AFTER PAYING NOT A SMALL SUM OF MONEY, I FEEL A  LITTLE ROOKED.
MY SUGGESTION IS TO KEEP WATCHING THAT WORN OUT VHS COPY  UNTIL DISNEY DECIDES TO INVEST A LITTLE MORE IN ONE OF THEIR CROWN  ACHIEVEMENTS. OH AND DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT LIMITED ISSUE NONSENSE  MEANING THAT THEY ONLY MANUFACTURE EACH MOVIE TITLE ON A LIMITED NUMBER RUN  ONLY ONCE PER GENERATION (WITH DISNEY, GENERATIONS ARE BORN QUITE OFTEN).  RIGHT NOW, THEY OBVIOUSLY ARE HAVING A GIGANTIC CASE OF TIGHTWADITIS AND  YET ARE STILL PRICING THEIR TITLES WELL ABOVE OTHER STUDIOS. SAD, SAD,  SAD!
I ONLY HOPE WE ALL CAN SEE THIS MOVIE IN ITS FULL WIDESCREEN GLORY  AND SOUND SOON!  PETER PAN IN ITSELF IS STILL MAGICAL!
