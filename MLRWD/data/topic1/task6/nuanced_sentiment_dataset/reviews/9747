Its a pretty boring and stupid anime. The characters aren't likeable at all, especially the female lead. Shes pretty much a stuck up b**** who needs to be smacked down a peg two. Everytime she and the male lead talk, she always ends up yelling at him. Why the Yamato guy likes Sukuka is beyond me. Yamato is just as much to blame though, there were several hot, caring characters he could have been with, but nooooo, he had to go for the b**** of a woman. You will more than likely be saying stuff like, "You idiot! Why not just go out with Honoka?!" I really hate how the characters dont change towards the end. I'm not quite sure what the term is, but you know when you watch a good anime and at the end you feel a sense of... crap, i dont know... release or happiness that things finally worked out? Anyway, this one doesn't have that. The end feels rushed and that they shouldn't be together. I guess this stems from the leads being unlikable characters.

To summarize: Suzuka is a plain and boring anime with the lead characters that not likeable. If they did some work on the lead characters, it might have been better. Anyway, if youre wanting a romantic comedy, try Love Hina, This Ugly Yet Beautiful World, Midori Days, or Ah! My Goddess.
