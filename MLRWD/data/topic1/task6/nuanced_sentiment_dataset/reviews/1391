In Shooter, Mark Wahlberg, a highly-trained Marine sniper, is set up by the CIA. Hired to do reconnaissance, he unwittingly falls for the trap sprung by Danny Glover and his agency henchmen. Through sheer perseverance and with the help of his best friend's ex-fiancee, he survives and lives to seek revenge. Eventually, viewers learn that the assassinated Ethiopian cleric was going to reveal the massacre of innocent people in his country by American oil interests.

Shooter suffers because it offers nothing new. It did not up the ante in terms of special effects. The scenarios were rather trite, and the action sequences were lackluster. With an open-ended finale, the viewer receives the impression that the filmmakers seemed to be torn by ambiguity. On the one hand, Wahlberg kills Glover and his corrupt government friends. However, the interests responsible for the massacre and others like it are then left relatively unscathed. Put another way, the movie appears to be hinting at the absurdity of life, but also suggests that a single person can make a difference.
