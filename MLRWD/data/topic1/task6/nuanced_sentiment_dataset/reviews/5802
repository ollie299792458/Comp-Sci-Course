The story of Shaka is related based on Zulu legend and the diary of Dr Henry Fynn - as such, the actor who plays Fynn is also the narrator.

What I appreciated is a look into Zulu politics - yes, the native socio-political scene in Africa in the 1800s extended beyond savages running around in their birthday suits. The rivaly between clans reminded me of the Houses in Dune, and was dominated by themes of honour, protocol and strategy. Quite interesting was that pre-Shaka warfare was dictated by the notion that the less the bloodshed, the more succesful the tactic... and was more of a power-joust than an actual battle.

So this is probably not the most historically accurate TV series you'll ever see, but it's very entertaining. The existence and role of Pampata (Shaka's girlfriend) is highly debated; and although Fynn's diary does make mention of an authenticated pregnacy, it was most likely by another girl.

A bit violent, so not recommended for small children - but I would recommended it for people from an African background who yearn for a bit of pride in their roots.
