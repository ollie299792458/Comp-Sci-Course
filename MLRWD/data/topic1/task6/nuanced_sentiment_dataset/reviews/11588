Season 13 of the Simpsons is a decent one, offering many funny and laugh out loud moments. You can, however, see the beginning of the decline in quality as the season progresses. The elements of change are evident, as more pop culture celebrities become the norm, and Homer becomes more mean spirited and less oaf-ish. That said, the worst part of the season is the packaging itself. It's almost like they see the complaints and purposely make them worse. So, last time, when we complained about the terrible packaging that is Season 12, they release Season 20 with even worse packaging. When we complained about Season 20, they release Season 13 with the same packaging. It's almost like they're going out of their way to make things worse. I mean, why add a closed flap when you can save money by not having it? I'd almost swear it was vindictive. If not, then they have no clue what people are saying about the packaging, and they'll continue in the future so we might as well get used to it.

So, the show gets 4 stars for content, and I take away 2 for packaging, as if they'll actually listen.
