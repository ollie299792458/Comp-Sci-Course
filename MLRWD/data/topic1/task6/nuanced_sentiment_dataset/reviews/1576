First of all let me make a statement.  I am not a country music fan!  My wife rented this movie last night and invited me to watch it with her.  I gave in and fired up the plasma tv and bose system.  Then a funny thing happened....For the length of the movie I sat in amazement.  The acting was extremely good,  The story was interesting, and the dialog was well above average.  Pheonix has proven to be an exceptional actor.  Both Pheonix and Witherspoon gave a very convincing performance.  Before last night, I had never really paided any attention to Johnny Cash or cared one iota about his life and accomplishments.  I was surprised at what challenges life had dealt him before and during his climb to fame.  Few films have ever left me feeling enriched, but this one did!  When it was over I thought that it was terrible that Johnny and June had not lived to see this film.  I think they would have been honored by the performance and production of this movie.  I'm still not a C&W fan, but now I have a healthy amount of respect for the "Man in Black".

Excellent Film.
