Some spoilers ahead

After reading a lot of other reviews here which suggest that the book is fantastic, I'm thinking that maybe this is a book that just doesn't translate to film. I did not read the book and I thought the both actors did a great job with the material....I just thought that it was obvious that the screenplay was working too hard to explain everything that the whole thing seemed contrived. So instead of concentrating on the the characters, what they are experiencing...you are too busy putting together a plot that really isn't the right kind of plot for a movie. This movie lost me at the  time travelling fetus. Maybe this works in the book, but the way it's presented in the movie it's just ridiculous. So then he doesnt tell her but gets the operation which is also ridiculous--its an obvious plot trick because no one does that in real life without discussing it with their spouse. Then she cheats on him with an earlier version of himself...this was like desperate housewives meets back to the future when I was expecting The Notebook. I just wasn't into it and was so focused on the ridiculousness of the plot that I couldn't care about the characters.
