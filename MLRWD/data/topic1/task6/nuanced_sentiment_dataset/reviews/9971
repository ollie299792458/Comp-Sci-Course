Jaws 2 is a very good sequel to the original 1975 blockbuster, unlike the other two sequels that came in the 80's. It had been four years since the infamous great white shark terrorized the small summer resort of Amity Island. But in all of the vast and unknown depths of the ocean, how could there been only one? Really simple, it's impossible. In this 1978 sequel directed by Jeannot Scwarz, unsuspecting vacationers begin to dissapear in an all too familiar fashion, and only one man knows the truth. This new shark is not only attacking divers and waterskiers, but teenagers manning sailboats, including Martin Brody's two sons Michael and Sean. Roy Scheider returns as Amity Police Chief Martin Brody who this time finds himself in a race against time to save his sons and other teenagers from the beast. The ending is a real shocker if you know what I mean. Anyways, Jaws 2 is a good sequel unlike Jaws 3 and Jaws The Revenge which could use the MST3K treatment (that's what Tom Servo would say).
