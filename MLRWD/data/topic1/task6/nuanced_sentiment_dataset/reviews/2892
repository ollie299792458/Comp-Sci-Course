this film isnt very good at all.certainly not the masterpiece many claim.first things first,this is NOT typical scottish day to day living.much like a hood film like boyz n the hood,or the film kids,this film shows the most extreme example.and much like kids,this movie offers nothing more than cheap violent thrills and a bit of action.the ending is pathetic.why would he stab the guy at the end???? the answer is he wouldnt,therefore this it is rubbish!!! im not saying people like this dont exist,but there in the minority,whereas this film pictures this as a normality.its the fact its proporting to be realistic,but is no where near realistic that is the problem.much like the movie kids,rather than offering any answers to the problems,it just says,heres some very silly and misguided people for you to have a laugh at.the plotline is very poor,not really following a logical course,building up to the poor ending.realistic??? scottish people dont talk to each other like that!!!! i should know.ok,a very small number do.some of the dialogue is laughable in places.all of this smacks of a poorly constructed and hastily made film.and i dont think the lead character is acting that childishly brash little rogue he plays in the film,as any interview ive ever seen him in he comes across exactly like that.in short a poor movie.2 out of 5.
