As a 57 year old who saw the 1st one,this is probably the worst

movie of all time.I ask one question..why did they let this be released? Nobody in the suits watched this first?

If they had watched it,they would have hidden their faces with the wax.

Not even the bad,bad,Ed Wood flicks(which actually I love)

come close to this loser.

Wow what a stinker. Bad music,bad script,bad acting.

Stealing a fantastic old movies name. Now that's probably the

worst thing of all.

Kids,get the original. No nudity,swearing,horrible music..

Just an oldfashioned thriller.

Of course the cast is probably the worst assortment of

 non actors

you could dig up.Well,I take that back.

There was a good actor.

The guy who played the third brother.

 However,I don't think he had do much acting. Remember the banjo player in Deliverance??

Paris Hilton???????? Oh my gawd..honey this is not hot..even with the heat of the wax.
