I am a hardcore Nicholson fan, and I even special ordered his hard-to-get titles for my own library, but this character he played just left me feeling like it would be the last film I'd want my children, or even my friends to see. Why? Because the theme of this whole movie is that there isn't much in life worth doing--or being, or sharing. The insurance salesman turned retiree has a view of the world, and almost everyone in it, as stupid, unattractive, and that nothing old is attractive. He seems to dispise his wife's idiocycrasies but she doesn't get the pleasure back. If all you saw of getting old was this movie, "You wouldn't even GO THERE!! He is harsh on everybody around him, and yet not very hard on himself--and even at the end of the movie, he learns only a small part of what we have to learn to accept and enjoy in our lives, if we want to have joy in it. No, I would view it more like non-entertainment, and non-Nicholson, but there were a few funny parts with the letters to the Tanzanian child. I need a "vintage" Jack Nicholson role (where you know he's going to give us what we all what him for) real soon to get this slow, sarcastic, and cryptic one behind me. Deleting the [deleted] scenes didn't speed up the film, and I doubt they would have slowed it down much had they been included--it was pretty much down and downer. Sorry, Jack, it wasn't you--I think if you could have responded the way you wanted--and the way I wanted to see you respond, At the reception, we all waited for a Jack "Splat" the real deal, and you didn't. You smarmed, and they want us to believe you had a mellowing of heart. No. No. NO. With parts of (real, expressed rage) like only you can do, the movie could have been great.
