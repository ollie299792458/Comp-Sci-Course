While it is very well made and wonderful, the movie does have many differences from the book.  The most obvious is the Preacher's character.  In the book, the Preacher is much more soft and is shown perhaps as a little weak.  In the movie, however, he is much harder and harsher in the way he talks to Opal.  He has less patience and also does not want to keep Winn-Dixie, which differs from the book.  He also does not tell Opal ten things about her mother when she first asks him.  She has to ask him a second time and even then, some of the ten things differ and he only gives her nine initially in the movie.  Like the Preacher, Otis is a little harder character initially in the movie.  In the book, he is presented as a very shy man.  Also, the trailer park owner's character is absent in the book, while the movie brings him into the action.  Another added character is the foolish cop.  The movie seems to have included him for a bit of comedic relief, but he is nowhere to be seen in the book.  Something great in the movie that is absent from the book is that the audience is able to see into Opal's imagination.  Perhaps it is the movie's way of giving the audience a better picture of how she is processing the stories that she is being told.  These differences do not take away from the movie's overall affect, but may be recognized by those that love the book.
