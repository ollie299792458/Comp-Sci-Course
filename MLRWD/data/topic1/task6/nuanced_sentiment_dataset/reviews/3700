This score is for the DVD quality itself--the actual product you would end up with here--rather than the movie per se, which would rate 4 or 5 stars. I remember enjoying this movie on TV years ago and was prompted to track it down again when I came across "90 Seconds at Entebbe" in a bookstore. I tried several times to rent it via (you-know-who) but availability was apparently very limited--I would put it in my queue and it would either simply disappear(!) later or would be moved to a separate "unavailable" list at the bottom. So I was fairly excited when the movie stayed on the queue and, lo and behold, finally showed up in my mailbox.

What a disappointment--I'm glad I didn't actually spend money on this, especially with the nearly $20 asking price here. The movie itself is very good, with solid pacing and a reasonable performance by Bronson, Yaphet Kotto and the other actors. What kills this DVD is possibly the worst transfer I've EVER seen--very, VERY dark, from a poor original copy of the film. And did I mention it's REALLY dark in a lot of spots? My disk also displayed a narrow black bar along most of the bottom of the screen, with a tiny edge of original footage visible to the left of the bar; apparently this cropping of part of the original is an artifact of a sloppy conversion that the distributors didn't consider to be an issue. My home DVD-VHS recorder would have done a better job. Hopefully a more responsible distributor will pick this one up someday.
