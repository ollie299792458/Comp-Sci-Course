I notice that there are some people who assume that only Dennis DeYoung lovers are responsible for all comments panning the current lineup's recordings. Not true. I own every recording Styx has ever published, and have attended concerts including every lineup. It's simple, Lawrence Gowan just isn't a great vocalist. There is no no need to compare him to Dennis in order to recognize that fact.

I want to make it clear that I have edited this review based on listening to the CD's, watching the DVD and seeing them in concert again since my original review. Let's be clear about what this is: it is an opinion piece regarding the re-release of Styx: Grand Illusion / Pieces of Eight - Live [Blu-ray]. I have been a Styx fan since 1975 and have seen every lineup they have ever put on stage. I will admit that the gaffs that Lawrence Gowan commits on stage have been "fixed" in these recordings for the most part. This review is not about the state of the band beyond what they have recorded in this effort. I don't care about the politics and hand wringing. I am simply stating that while this is the current lineup's best effort to date, it still doesn't give the music on these albums their full due. Close, but not quite.

I did send them a thank you note however for releasing remastered audiophile vinyl versions of these albums. NOW, they are AWESOME!

I wish I could have any of you who decide to hate on me for my heartfelt review over for a listening party. Then we could debate the nitty gritty of our opinions, and hopefully come to a mutual understanding.
