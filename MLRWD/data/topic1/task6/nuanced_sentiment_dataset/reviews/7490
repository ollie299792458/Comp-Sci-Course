Just like another reviewer, I too was VERY disappointed in the much-hyped original ending of Pretty in Pink. I was among those who felt that Andie should have ended up with Duckie, so I was eagerly awaiting the chance to finally see it happen. Well, the last 20 years were spent waiting in vain! Although the original Andie/Duckie ending was shown in theaters (and rejected by test audiences), it was not reproduced for this DVD. All we see is the cast talking about the ending and why "it just didn't work." How about letting the fans see it and decide for themselves? As for the "Volcanic Ensembles" extra that talks about Andie's and Duckie's costumes, it would have been worth mentioning why Andrew McCarthy's character wears the same white pants and blue shirt throughout the whole film!

While I love this movie, the "Everything's Duckie Edition" was really a letdown, which is why I am only giving it three stars. About the only worthwhile part of the so-called original ending is Andrew McCarthy's explanation as to why Blane's hair (which was so impeccable throughout the movie) looks like an overgrown mushroom during the prom scene. Maybe the last 20 years haven't been spent waiting in vain, after all ....
