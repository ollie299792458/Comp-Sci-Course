I mainly picked this up because I wanted "Breaking Glass" and "Times Square" but the prices on them were outrageous.  In an 80s nostalgia mood, obviously.

This movie has plenty of "punk" nihilistic attitude - or rather, some of the characters do - but very little of the frenetic energy and explosive sense of liberation that punk and new wave also embraced.  The pacing just trudges along in three feet of mud pretty much the whole time.

Ray Winstone is fantastic as usual.  Diane Lane is very good in the lead role, particularly considering how young she is.  Fee Waybill is entertaining as a has-been rocker.  But for me the thrills were in seeing Paul Cook, Steve Jones and Paul Simonon playing together. The Looters' performance pretty much steals the show, but that was all of about 3 minutes of screen time.

Admittedly they do try to take the rock film form a bit beyond the usual cliches, but along the way they lose a lot of steam that could've kept it engaging.  You feel the dreary boredom of being stuck on a tourbus yourself, instead of the thrill of being part of a rising band in a vibrant scene.  In other words, the filmmakers took early 80s subject matter and made an early 70s-type film about it, dwelling all too heavily on the unhappy internal lives of the characters and their various disappointments.

Two years after principal filming was completed they shot the last few minutes of the film, and the jarring change of tone does not work at all, at least not for me.

Disc-wise I haven't checked out the commentary tracks etc. but I do wish the disc had subtitles.  I'd enjoy this film on mute, with subtitles on, while I played a bunch of records, just for the time period visuals, but I don't think I'll be watching it again otherwise.
