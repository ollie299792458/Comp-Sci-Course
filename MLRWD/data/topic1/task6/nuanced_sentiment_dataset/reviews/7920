This movie was truly a surprise, and a victim of bad timing.  It was eerie, suspensful, funny, and somewhat similar to and released around the same time as the Sixth Sense.  The mammoth success of Sixth Sense truly  wounded this film's potential.Kevin Bacon does a great job as playing a  madman driving by those subliminal movie messages like "Dig".  He  opens up a pathway into the paranormal world after being placed into a  hypnotic spell by Ileana Douglas(Fox's Action).  From there he finds that  he not the only one in his family with the "Shinning", yes the  Shinning.  Do you want to get sued lad!  Sorry, Simpson's reference after  he sees his son talking to "imaginary" dead friends as we all  tended to do from time to time.  While the movie was overshadowed by Sixth  Sense it had more action, and moved at a faster pace. The only thing that  Sixth sense had over the films was it's incredible ending.  The movie would  have you jumping one minute and laughing the next, but not in the  predictable way most horror movies do.  It was truly well done, and had a  great sex scene where the wife wakes the husband(Bacon) for some loving.  It's true in movies dreams can come true.  Go see it or buy it either way  you shouldn''t be disappointed unless you one of the people that likes to  ruin a movie by saying that's a rip-off from Sixth Sense or that doesn't  happen in the Sixth Sense.  Also, look for the microwave burrito on the  nightstand.  I'm still not sure of the symbolism, but I'm sure it's  something genious.  Take care, go get it!
