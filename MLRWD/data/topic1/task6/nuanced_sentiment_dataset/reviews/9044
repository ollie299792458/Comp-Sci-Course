This was a movie that is better than it is being given credit for.  Anyone that plays pool, like myself,  will appreciate this movie.  But like "The Color of Money" and "The Hustler" if you dislike pool the slitest bit , you are gonna hate it.  And contrary to "Wannabe poole" there, Mike Massey was indeed in this movie at the Pro tournament.  Walken like usual acts his role to perfection.  And the "final" hustle of the movie was classic. And also the 4 balls off the table hustle mentioned by another reviewer as "not likely"  is actually commen and easy to pull off against your average joe who doesnt play often where they think you have to make 8 balls and they only have to make 4, but in order for this to work you need to be good enough not to miss.  All things in this movie seem to fit right to me except the putting the money on the lights, most pool halls dont allow gambling, but dont try to stop it either.  All in all being a person that lives thier life in and out of a pool hall, this movie fit most aspect perfectly and the low profile cast helped to concentrate on the movie instead of the actors...
