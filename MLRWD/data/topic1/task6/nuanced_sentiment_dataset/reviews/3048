The show is great, been a fan since the pilot. I can't understand why they would create a widescreen release for this show. They simply trimmed the 4:3 to get the 16:9. Also, the Digital Copy versions you can get online are only for WMP and some portable player that no one uses. They are not compatible with iPod or iPhone ... why? That is a huge huge market they are missing. Last, the case does not fit with the previous seasons DVD cases, so it looks akward on the shelf with the prior 11 seasons on DVD. First, they did finally get the text on the spine in the correct direction, so it looks funny on the shelf next to the other seasons on DVD. Next, the case size is smaller than the DVD case ... why would they do that? Seems to me the best thing would be to release them in the same box as the DVD releases, with some minor graphic changes for the blu-ray ... and just keep consistent with previous releases. I wish I could simply blast the distibutor ... you &^$(*&# suck!

I am going to return and get the DVD release. Paying extra for 1080i and 5.1 was not worth the extra money. Besides you can't tell the difference when upscaling the DVD to 1080i. I was really hoping to be pleased with this release, but in the end the distributor let me down.
