Lets stop with the, "Great message" talk. This isn't Remember the Titans or Finding Forrester. There is no message given in this movie except for that all of these actors should fire their agents for letting them star in this movie. I will admit that I laughed a lot in this movie. In fact I laughed throughout much of the last 30 minutes because of how BAD this movie was, and how embarrassed I was to tell my friends that I saw it.

Lets look at what you got here: Rob Schneider who can carry a leading role about as well as I can carry a grand piano; John Heder who (sorry bud) you will be stuck as Napoleon for the rest of your life; and David Spade who hasn't been much since the great Chris Farley passed. If you are 14 you may like this movie, but I highly doubt it. Here's the rediculous plot: Three grown men, two of whom are very special, play in some wacky tournament of little league teams. That's right, 3 against 9 in baseball. THAT HAPPENS A LOT!! Do yourself a favor and find a movie that is funnier, more reasonable and more entertaining.
