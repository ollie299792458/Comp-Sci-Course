This show is exilent, don't get me wrong, but I really felt that a warning needs to go out to people that don't know much about anime.. -This is absolutly NOT the show that you've heard so much about-.. If your looking at this and thinking "Oh, I've heard of this, maybe I should check it out!" your probably thinking of: (Oh My Goddess (Vol. 1) (1997)).... -This is a Telivision show that was based on those OVA's-..

*Slight spoiler warning*

Actually, honestly, I very dissapointed in it, being a big fan of the original, as they have very little in common. The characters and locations are nearly identical, the story even starts out about the same, but they take drastic terns from each other a few episodes in.... Where in the original, hopfully not to spoil to much, The main characters are -forced- to sepperate, being the main story line. It creates an intence tragity/romance setting.... In this one a few episodes in, insted, a demon is released that wants to take revenge on the goddesses, as the main story line. It creates a very childish Adventure/drama enviroment.... And also, as the show progresses, nearly no romantic progress is made... Honestly, it's hardly even the same show, it's hardly belivable that they gave it the same name... The characters are the same, and the show is entertaining in it's own rite.. But it's NOT the romance/comady that I fell in love with 10 years ago....

Sorry if this sounded like a rant, I just wanted to clear up missconseption -Aurael
