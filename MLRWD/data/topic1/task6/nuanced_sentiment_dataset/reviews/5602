Elvis got about everything he wanted in life except what he wanted most.To become a first rate actor.Elvis along with other actors like Dick Powell and Frank Sinatra complained that they were doing too many musicals.Dick Powell got his his big chance with Murder My Sweet and Frank Sinatra with From Here To Eternity which sent them on their way.Alas,Elvis never did.
Getting back to Blue Hawaii I thought the soundtrack to this film was much better than the film itself.(Cant Help Falling In Love,Rock A Hula Baby,Moonlight Swim,etc)
However,just for the songs alone the film is worth seeing.
The only time Elvis and Angela Lansbury ever worked together.
Jenny Maxwell and her husband were murdered years later.(No conspiracy ideas,Please.)
Also in cast Roland Winters,Steve Brodie,Joan Blackman,(Who plays Elvis Love interest)and Iris Adrian,etc..
Its too bad Elvis didnt make more Flaming Stars and King Creoles.He could have, sooner or later made it like Frank and Dick did.
