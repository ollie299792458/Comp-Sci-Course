I only give this two stars instead of one because, unfortunately, my niece loves it (meaning-- ugh!-- repeat viewings). She first saw it when she was 3, and too little to know better, I guess. Oh, I suppose, on its own, its not terrible-- not great either, mind you, but not terrible. However, given the original's vast superiority, this little trifle is best left unexplored.

 I found the main characters incredibly annoying (sorry Scott, sorry Alyssa), and the songs even more so. You may disagree, but I LOATHE these type of Broadway show tunes; and you certainly didn't see that in the original, so why here? Why "update" a period piece in the first place? This film pretty much gets the look of the original, but that's about it. Just what I'd expect from a straight-to-video sequel. I don't know why Disney insists on continuing this trend-- oh wait, yes I do: $$$$. For myself, I give it only one star, but your little one, like my niece, may be entertained.

 Like my title says, it is my opinion that you should skip this one and get the original.
