The original was a great movie, and really helped advocate the growing trend of import tuning & racing. The "2 Fast 2 Furious" sequel turned out to be a bogus attempt to take the original a step further. The thing that made the original so cool was that it was all about the cars and the racing scene (particularly LA/So. Cal). 2 Fast 2 Furious simply feels like another cop movie with chase scenes and a poor story.

I've never seen a sequel bomb as badly as this one. It's too bad they didn't try harder to make this one a hit too. No wonder Vin Diesel didn't appear in this one: Apparently he can see a bad script a quarter-mile away.

I'm glad I only rented this movie. If I would have paid full price to own it I would be forced to sell it to some poor unsuspecting fool. I have one more thing to say about this movie, and it is a possible spoiler so if you haven't watched it skip to the next review.

The first scene was the worst of the whole movie, so it really failed to set the mood for the rest of the flick. Most of the first race was done by low-budget computer graphics, and it is painfully obvious. The steam from the Nissan Skyline's hood was just lame, BTW.

Do yourself a favor, buy a different movie.
