How do you make a movie that is side-splitingly funny, appeals to the teenage youth audience (14-19 year old males), and yet is socially relevant in today's "anything for a thrill" world? Answer: you take MTV funny man Tom Green, a great script, an awesome supporting case, and a director who knows how to make comedy - and you have a delicious cocktail of hilarity that the whole audience gets to drink from!!  This was - without a doubt - one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and repeated viewings have only confirmed my desires! 
Green plays a man who is teetering on the brink of insanity, riven with guilt over a failed relationship. His response: comedy. What follows is 96 minutes of hilarity, tomfoolery, sight gags, word plays, and a surprise ending that will keep you viewing again and again. I took my 3 year old daughter to it and she loved it!... 
Naturally, there are the detractors that try to take away something from Tom Green, saying he isn't funny. Saying he's too caustic. Not original. Vulgar. Well, these critics don't understand the obvious subversive humor of Green - which seeks to expose our hypocrisies, to confront us with the daily lies and half-truths that we live our lives by. Who among us would not like to just retreat into the peaceful inner-child of the Green character and "act out" on our fantasies? Like Lenny Bruce and George Carlin before him, Green is essentially misunderstood in the context of post-modernist comedy theories.
A great movie to own or rent!!!
