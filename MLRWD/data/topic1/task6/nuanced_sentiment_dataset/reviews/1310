I'm never sure if I should rate the film or dvd so I decided to rate the dvd, and I give it two stars, the FILM FIVE STARS. Like many, no doubt, I've been waiting for a big special edition of Planes Trains and Automobiles for years, and after seeing a clip from a 1987 Candy-Hughes-Martin press conference a long time ago, I was dying to see the whole press conference someday. Well, I guess I am supposed to be grateful to get little snippets from that conference, but isn't it easier to just slap the entire uncut press conference on the dvd and then create a making-of documentary as a separate extra? Huh? Isn't it obvious? And.......two little quick-as-lightning tributes to the two Johns......what's up with that? And finally, ONE DELETED SCENE? Come on!!! As has been pointed out many times, many uncut scenes were in the tv versions over the years. There's supposed to be a 3 hour workprint somewhere! Why can't thoughtful, artistic people who care about movies release these dvds instead of corporate suits? Why are we supposed to be grateful for tiny little things that just whet our appetite for more? Why will a "shower curtain ring" special edition with one new extra,a 30-second tv spot, no doubt be released in 2015? Why was John Candy taken away from us so soon so that we have to rely on cold moneygrubbing bigwigs to give us whatever is left of him?
