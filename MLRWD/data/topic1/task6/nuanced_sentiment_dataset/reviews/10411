Oh man, get out your lube because you know where Pioneer wants to stick it. Where's the incentive to buy the boxed set here? I bought each dvd individually for roughly the same price.

Furthermore they put the series on EIGHT dvds which is just inexcusable for a 26 episode series (25 if you count the fact that one episode is basically a recap). There is no way a dvd should have less than 5 episodes on it.

BUT WAIT! What about the special features? Yet another slap in the face. You get...get ready for this: CONCEPT ART!!! Wow, what a concept (nyuck, nyuck). Riddle me this, Pioneer: Why would I want to look at sketches when I can watch the actual finished product?

This series really deserves four stars in my opinion, but this box set is about as well put together as a boxed lunch. If you're looking for an even better anime, check out Cow..no wait that's already been said by 50 million other reviewers. Check out Gungrave, another anime adapted from Yasuhiro Nightow's manga (this one doesn't have those annoyingly goofy caricatures that plague Trigun).
