This is one of my favorite movies. When it first came out in theaters, I saw it multiple times, and I've owned it on VHS, laserdisc, multiple DVD versions, and now this Blu-ray edition. I was excited to see this movie get the Blu-ray treatment, too, until I watched it. While the menus are nice and very well done (other than the same 7 measures of music repeating every 20 seconds), it's quickly obvious the studio just slapped this release together without giving much thought to it.

The first thing I noticed was that it wasn't a very good remastering. The cover says, "1080p / Beyond High Definition", but the movie is anything but that. While it is slightly better than the various DVD releases I have, the picture isn't as good as on the laserdisc version. The film was not cleaned up much (if at all), and often had a very grainy look to it, though the blacks (often a problem on DVD releases) were better, with much less anti-aliasing and pixelation going on.

My biggest beef with this release, though, is the lack of any special features other than an audio commentary track and Spanish subtitles. Since they obviously didn't use up all the space for the movie, they should have at least included the special features found on the DVD releases. This kind of movie begs to have "how we did this" special features, and it would have been easy to include them as they were already released on the various DVDs.

The movie is a 4 1/2  to 5 star film, but this release just doesn't do it justice. I suggest waiting for a Blu-ray release which has a little more effort put into it.
