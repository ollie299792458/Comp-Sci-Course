I have not interest in christianity or christ, but I do have interest in music... when I was a kid I attended a french catholic school, one day;  the priests showed us the original Hell's Bells... while most of my mates cheered when guns & roses and poison appeared, I was more interested in hendrix, led zeppelin or the beatles, after that day, i decided to look for these and many other artists albums (of course I had heard the beatles, but the fact that they were considered satanic, made me want to listen more of them)... I can say hell's bells changed my life, but not in the way intended by the mullet-guy that preaches, It showed me lots of bands/artist otherwise unavailable through radio at the time.

But then I listened about this so-called "sequel", I rented it, and I must say
First: this is nothing but an updated version of the old 80s video, the guy looks older, and they name many new bands, but even the most hilarious parts of hells bells I are recreated here completely; like the poisoned M&Ms, or Withney Houston singing to a dead guy. (they should have changed her for beyonce or something)
Second: while the original hell's bells displayed many underground and obscure bands (like Venom), this new "documentary" focuses on mainstream pop, and nu-metal like limp bizkit, for a younger viewer may be a way to discover some bands but nothing like the original.

if they found something wrong in all the important rock acts in history... why they never mentioned the clash?... they rock!
