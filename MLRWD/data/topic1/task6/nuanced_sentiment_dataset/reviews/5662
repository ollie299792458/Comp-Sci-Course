Is it too much to ask that characters in a movie behave like real people? Apparently it is as far as this movie is concerned, as Edward Anderson only seemed interested in figuring out how could stretch his premise out to feature length. This unfortunately means that, despite the fact that our protagonists are given several opportunities to escape from or kill their captor, they consistently blow their chances for freedom and survival. (I can understand their early reluctance to take a life, but after watching the driver mercilessly kill innocent people, I think that they would lose their inhibitions.) Their captor, by the way, seems to be possessed of superhuman endurance, as he takes all kinds of abuse throughout the film but keeps operating at full strength. (The fact that he allows it to happen at all is pretty ludicrous, given the fact that we're led to believe that he's been doing this for years. These seem like the mistakes of an amateur, things he should have planned for by this point.) Worst of all, the whole movie builds up to an anti-climax that is somewhat offensive in its exploitation of a real world tragedy. (I half-expected the movie to have self-important delusions of relevancy, displaying some text at the end to inform the viewers about this ongoing injustice.) I'm not sure why this has received so many high marks. It may be well acted and competently directed, but those elements can't overcome a poorly (and lazily) written script.
