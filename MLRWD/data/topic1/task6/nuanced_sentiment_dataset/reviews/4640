I really wanted to like this movie much more than I did, although I think there were several inspired performances which raised the movie from ho-hum to somewhat better than average. The biggest problem with the movie was that it has been done before, and much better: "The Dead Poet's Society" and "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie" are two movies that instantly leap to my mind. In my opinion, the movie emphasized the wrong characters: the young women played by Kristen Dunst and Julia Stiles were far less interesting than the Maggie Gyllenhaal and Juliet Stevenson characters (the Stevenson character left the movie far too early). The marriage vs career script was for the most part uninspiring and ho-hum. The characters, except for Gyllenhaal and Dunst, were pretty much divided up between all good and all bad; Dunst's mother was a stock villain who seemed straight out of that classic of the early 1960s, "A Summer Place."
The outstanding performances of the movie were turned in by Julia Roberts and Marcia Gay Harden, playing women totally opposite from each other who became friends of sorts. Ms Harden did an excellent job of portraying a woman so scared of living that she would rather stay home to watch a game show on televison than go out for a night on the town with the friend who would soon be leaving forever. That scene neatly forshadowed the rest of the characer's life, hunkering down to protect herself from the world. Roberts performance was vastly underrated: it will be a long time before I forget how skillfully she portrayed the humiliation her character felt when tormented on her first day in the classroom by her students. 
More bonus material on the DVD would have been welcome, but this seems to be getting to be fairly standard for regularly priced DVDs.
