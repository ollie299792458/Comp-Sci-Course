It was only a matter of time till someone made a female version of The Fugitive. Too bad it wasn't as great. Lucky for me, it was still entertaining.
Double Jeopardy stars Ashley Judd (you know, the good  looking Judd) and Tommy Lee Jones (you know, the guy from the male version  of The Fugitive?). Judd is convicted of killing her husband and after being  sent to prison discovers that he is still alive. Of course, she has already  been convicted of the crime, so she is legally free to murder him now, as  she can not be tried again. And so off she goes breaking parole when she is  finally released, and off goes Tommy Lee Jones after her as her parole  officer who thinks she really may have gotten the raw end of the  deal.
The film feels extremely similar to The Fugitive, perhaps a lot  because of Jones. Whatever the reason, we get the general idea of how this  film is going to go from the beginning. For that reason, we are very  forgiving for the film's implausible episodes.
In the end, Double  Jeopardy survives and is entertaining due to the talents of its main stars.  Judd is as always, enjoyable to watch. Jones is one of our best actors  today, and he shows it again here by playing a poorly written character,  but making it mighty enjoyable to watch. This is definitely worth a rent,  but only if you've already seen The Fugitive.
