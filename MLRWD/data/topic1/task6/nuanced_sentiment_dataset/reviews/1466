saved only by the talented actors, mostly Hugh Grant! I thought his performance was flawless & his expressions during the auditions were hilarious but I'm not sure why he put some of them through. 2 of the 3 finalists were horrible singers at best, lol. Mandy Moore plays a somewhat sweet, somewhat really not contestant who has similar traits to Hugh Grant's character, supposedly the "Simon Cowell" of the show. I love American Idol, I admit! partially the reason I wanted to see this film. I know it's suppose to be some sort of mockery of AI but I didn't find it to be. Dennis Quaide is funny as hell in this role, playing a president who spends all his time hiding in his room, his form of dealing with the stress of being President & such. & there's a sideplot with these Arabs(I think), lol, trying to kill the president as payback for the war. & it's all kinda cheesy, stupid, pointless, I could go on. this is a very weird film, entertaining for sure, but weird. I would give it a mild recommendation for good lead & supporting acting, strong energy & not taking itself seriously! otherwise, this would've been dull.
