Seriously, how is this film getting such positive reviews? I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow for negative numbers.

Like anyone else watching this film, I did so because I like a good zombie film.

This isn't one. In fact, its surprising to me that it could be this atrociously bad and still have been released without some sort of warning label such as "Warning: Total waste of time and money".

The plot is a mix-and-match of elements stolen from of a half dozen better done films, the acting is barely on a par with that usually found in lower end used-automobile commercials and the cast of characters couldn't be more stereotypical if you tried.

I should know better by now than to let myself be swayed by reviews and comments posted on the box, this one reading that (somehow) the producers/directors of "30 Days of Night" (a superb film) and "The Grudge" (another winner) were also involved in this one (why? did they lose a bet to someone?)

This one wouldn't even make a decent rental.
