The life of Oliver Tate is glib. He's not popular at school, his parents are growing farther apart, and he's trying to find meaning in his existence. When a mysterious girl draws him into his first romantic relationship, everything seems to fall into place. Until a strange self help guru moves in next door and his mom seems to take a fancy to him.

SUBMARINE is a hybrid of coming of age story, comedic drama, and experimental filmmaking. The story marches along in different parts, almost like a short story collection.

Oliver (played by Craig Roberts) is a strange, albeit charming protagonist who himself is a combination of Walter Mitty, Max Fischer from "Rushmore," and Paul McCartney (it's the hair and wardrobe.) He's aggravating in the beginning, but as the film progresses, he's actually funny and awkward. The people around him add to the awkwardness: his girlfriend Jordana, perceived as a quiet bully, has more story to her than she lets on. Oliver's parents are polar opposites who start off flat and never fully develop, which is unfortunate because there was a lot of potential for their plot. And seeing Paddy Considine in a mullet doing martial arts is a blast.

The music fits in to the film with ease, gliding along with an air of longing and pretentiousness which spoke to me. Pretentiousness is overrated, yet I can't help but enjoy the songs which highlight Oliver's life.

I enjoyed watching this; however, it felt like the film was trying to be over the top just because it could. This isn't necessary. I don't see the need to constantly be quirky when there is some good material in the first place. It's not bad though, just a detail which can be overlooked while you're watching. And this should be watched.
