From Smother Magazine smother.net:

Will Ferrell. You're a funny guy! Nicole Kidman. You're a pretty sweet actress! Combine them along with practically the entire former "Daily Show" crew and you have yourself a pretty great kneeslapper of a comedy. I'll admit I was a bit suspicious of a remake of television's funnier old sitcoms "Bewitched" but then I started seeing more than just the trailer and I thought that I'd at least give it a chance when it hit the rental scene. Boy was I in for a surprise. Not only was the movie better than I thought but it brought Mr. Ferrell back to the hilarious schtick that he seemed to lose in some of his more recent roles that, while funny, paled in comparisons to some of his funniest moments in "Old School". This movie also stars Michael Caine as the warlock father of Kidman's character. While the movie stayed faithful to the premise of the TV show, it veered off and put a more modern spin on it. Amazing both of the mega stars actually had some great on-camera chemistry, which made the movie that much more believable. Fun and lots of laughs!
