Godzilla 2000 is the welcomed and much anticipated return of the "classic" Godzilla. This is the old-fashioned way, and, indeed, the best way of making kaiju eiga (giant monster movies). Traditional and time-tested techniques have been enhanced with the latest digital technology and CGI. The Godzilla design, known in fandom circles as the Mire-Goji, is simply awesome. The composite shots of Godzilla'a raid early on in the film are very convincing. Godzilla 2000 contains some of the best SPFX of the entire series. The actors turn in inspired performances and the result is that we actually care about what happens to them. Although the main character is Godzilla himself, the relationships between the various leads grow and evolve and are authentically and convincingly portrayed. The battle bewteen Godzilla and the Alien/Millennian is one of the best monster battles in several years. 
I left the theatre smiling after having seen one of the most refreshing and well-crafted giant monster movies in a long time. The re-scoring of the film by Peter Robinson was excellent and added greatly to the scenes of Godzilla confronting the military and the final fight to the finish with his monster antagonist.
Great, stunning visuals, convincing, even charming human portrayals and titantic battles puncutate this most enjoyable movie experience.
