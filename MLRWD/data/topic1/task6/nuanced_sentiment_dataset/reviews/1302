The Omega Man is a racist parable about saving the white man's culture from the perceived threat of black ignorance. Neville, the last (white) man on earth, roams an apocalyptic wasteland killing off members of 'the Family' (African American slang, brothers) who, though mostly white, are coded as black by their hooded robes. The music, starting as classical and white pop, moves to more dangerous funk as the Family attacks Neville at his home. Zachary's use of the forbidden gun symbolizes the treachery of blacks, and their inability to play by the rules, even their own. Lisa and Richie, two black characters, are saved by bodily transfusions from Neville, semen and blood respectively, becoming spiritual mulattoes. This is not enough to save them however, as both are caught out by the Family after dark, when they should be home (CPT), and Lisa becomes a member of the Famly and Richie is destroyed by them. It is their inherent blacknesss (one drop rule) that ultimately causes their destruction. Neville's death comes by spear (traditional African weapon) as he is distracted by Lisa. He manages to survive long enough to pass on a serum he has developed (white culture) to another group of survivors, so that they will not suffer the fate of the Family. The final shot, of neville with arms outstretched in the pool, evokes Christ and connects his suffering and persecution to Neville's, and to that of whites everywhere.
