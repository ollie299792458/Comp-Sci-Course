With an estimated budget of around $2,000,000, I still can't figure out what the producers spent their money on except perhaps a good advertising company that knew how to create pro-looking trailers and posters (and DVD menus) to disguise the conspicuous lack of professionalism regarding just about every other aspect of this movie (in my not-so-humble opinion). I know they didn't spend any money on dollies to support the camera while shooting since just about every shot was of the extremely-shaky hand-held variety (and besides, I'm not sure they make camera dollies for video-capturing cellphones held by someone exhibiting severe signs of delirium tremens). Did the shaky and out-of-focus hand-held shots make it look more dramatically real to me as perhaps was the intended effect dictated by the director's esoteric visions of artistic grandeur? No, they made it look like the cinematographer had just turned five years old and had hired his younger brother to be the cameraboy. Did the supposedly scary religious superstition about demonic possession fill the essence of my movie-addicted soul with the exotic thrill of a mind-altering mood-modifying fear-intoxication diabolically drenched in the metaphoric mud puddles of dread and doom? No, but it did make me regret placing this flick at the top of my Queue. But with a worldwide Box Office gross of $62,456,444, I suppose no one can justifiably accuse the producers of being commercially stupid. The history of Hollywood continues to prove that if something works once, it will usually keep working again and again until movie-going audiences learn to become a little bit more discriminating about how much they will pay and what their minimal entertainment expectations will be in return for parting with a small slice of their discretionary-income pie. My final question: If this is indeed "the last exorcism", what will they call the sequel?
