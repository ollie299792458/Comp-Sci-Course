It's obviously me that's marching out of time.  Everyone loves this movie.  Look all around you: 5 stars wherever you go.  Well, let me give you guys a tip, if you like this you'll love Ray Winstone's new movie, Te Proposition.  But why did I hate and despise both of these flicks?  In part because they announce and never stop announcing that they are "important" films that need to be taken seriously.  They have great actors giving psychologically penetrating and important character studies. We should all aet up seminar groups forthwith to discuss them and to compare Dostoevsky vision of Rakolnikov's maniacal violence to Ben Kingsely's.  Oh balls.  It's all too much for me to take.  It's a nasty little film about gangsters with some too too hammy performances, especially by James (or is it Edward? do I care) Fox that produces a lot of violence and never justifies its use of it (recent violent film that justifies its use of violence: the Beat the my heart skipped). Casting Ray Winstone as a gangster is as tired as Ian Mcshane as a cockney.  Even Kingsley is pretty much reprising. A Fox as a toff is absurd.  And the whole Boothby/Kray story line (queer toffs and gangsters) was true and has been done to death.  This whole absurd film is just a series of banal posturings meaning absolutely nothing.  Avoid it at all costs.
