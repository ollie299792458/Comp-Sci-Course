I love this movie. It's an outstanding film and a shmaltsy Christmas tradition. I only wish someone who cared about the movie could have been involved in the production of the DVD. Paramount must have used a fifty year old projector with a 3-watt bulb for this one. The color fluctuates continuously, as though someone was playing with the brightness. It's not the worst I've ever seen, but it's such a shame to let a flawed transfer like this out for such a fine movie.  The "making of" documentary with Rosemary Clooney was excellent. In fact, the movie clips in the documentary look infinitely superior to the body of the DVD itself. Paramount should hang it's head in shame at producing a DVD with such a low-quality image - and they're charging more than your average DVD as well! The audacity astounds me! I can only hope they recall this mess and re-transfer the film. Would I buy this, knowing what I know now? No, I don't think so. I'd wait to see if they re-release it. You shouldn't support their shoddy workmanship. Shame, shame, shame on you Paramount.
