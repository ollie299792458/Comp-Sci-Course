I know, CUJO came first, but I needed a catchy title for the review.  I saw this film in 1983, and everything in the movie was as I pictured it in the book.  Very good job with that.  The slow moving plot was necessary I think to get you to care about what happens to the characters.  It's hard to enjoy a movie if you don't feel some emotional attachment to the characters.  Overall, the story was very well done and when Cujo came on the scene, it kept you on the edge of your seat.  Now, for the bad news.  (Spoiler alert)  THEY LET THE TADDER LIVE.  ARRGGHHH!!!!  The way it ended spoiled the whole thing.  One thing I admired about this story was that it was one of King's most uncompromisingly honest.  He even mentions this in effect, saying, "Sorry, folks.  Bad things do happen to children sometimes.  It's a fact of life."  No, I don't enjoy seeing bad things happen to kids, but when Donna broke open the rear window of her car (using the butt of a policeman's gun of all things.  By the way, I'm surprised all that glass didn't get on Tad and cut him to pieces.) went into the house and resuscitaed Tad, this story lost all credibility.  Nice touch having Cujo, who we thought was dead burst through the window just as you think they're safe, but...sorry.  The ending ruined it for me.  Three stars out of five.
