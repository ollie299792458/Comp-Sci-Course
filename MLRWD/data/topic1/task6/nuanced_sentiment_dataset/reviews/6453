I watched this movie when it came out solely because it was Elijah Wood's next film after Lord of the Rings. Although a completely opposite role, it quickly became a favorite and I have watched it several times. (Just discovered whoever I loaned my copy to didn't return it, so I am ordering another.) This movie, to me, is about 2 grandsons and 2 grandfathers.  One grandson appears 'anal-retentive' and fearful of forgetting where he came from but also aware of  the importance of family in his life. The other, carefree and living mostly for the moment, states the past should be left in the past. Both love their grandfathers.  One grandfather has never forgotten his past and passes a piece of it on to his grandson.  The other grandfather has completely closed his past and may not even remember it himself.

The juxtaposition of the old and the new (for example, the 2 in babushkas on a bench, and then the camera rises and you see the skate park), the delightful music, and the hilarious, broken English all add to this wonderful film, that made me laugh, cry and think.  I highly recommend it.
