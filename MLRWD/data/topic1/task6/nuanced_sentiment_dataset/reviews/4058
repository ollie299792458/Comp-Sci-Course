I have no idea why this movie got so many bad reviews. Take it for what it is! It's a light hearted, funny, entertaining movie made for you to laugh and have a good time. I thought the story line wasn't so bad, it wasn't your usual boy meets girl, they fall in love, someone gets mad/hurt, they make up and kiss and happily ever after. This movie touched on real issues that people actually may go through in a marriage. At times it really made you wonder about how tough marriages can get, and how to get through that and find the love again. And i think people who are married can really appreciate that side of the story line. There was great timing from the main cast, SJP and HG knows how to deliver their lines and are great at their parts. Some of the one liners are hilarious, sure there were many corny parts, but c'mon it's a rom-com! Did you really expect Oscar winning directing, script and performance? I really enjoyed this movie over all for that it is. And my guy friend who i watched it with enjoyed it as well. If you're looking for a light comedy to take your mind off a hard day's work, you'll enjoy this one, I know I did.
