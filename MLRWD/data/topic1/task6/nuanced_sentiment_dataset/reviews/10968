There is little in this movie to warrant watching it.  It starts off as a kind of MAVERIC (remember the tv show) but then degenerates quickly to a confused kind of evangelistic horror western (if there is such a thing).

There is some potential for interest in the movie.  For example, given at the start, the town kills all its "degenerates" in a bid the clean itself up by this purging, why did the sheriff choose these four to save by putting them in jail and then helpling them get out of town.  If it was just for the cash why bother with all four?  Why not just the one guy with the money?  What made these four special?  Alas, this is never revealed.  And so goes the rest of the movie.

The lack of any kind of flow between events makes the movie useless.  For example, when the four arrive in a rain-storm at a deserted town they start a fire in one building to get warm.  So when did the drunk with the shot leg make his way to another building, why was he dead, and why was his left butt cheek carved up like a turkey?  Did Butt the black guy who sees ghosts and is also now missing, pick up a flesh eating habit from Chaco the bad gunman?  No explanation (maybe it is just as well).

Makes little sense, has no flow, has no value.

Hail Flavius!
