The header was the original name of the film.  Don't Cry Baby also made an appearance but in this DVD selection, it's Crime Wave.  Reviewers who are waxing poetic might be embellishing a bit.  This should be seen for the direction of Andre de Toth.  Shot in 13 days on a shoestring budget, his use of Los Angeles scenes seems documentary in style.  Very cool!

However, this movie is more a curio than must see.  Seeing Charles Bronson (credited as Charles Buchinsky) long before stardom is a kick.  Ted de Corsia as 'Doc' Penny, mob leader, nearly steals the film.  However, Sterling Hayden, as Detective Lieutenant Sims, is so bad he's almost comical.  Somebody should have fixed his clown tie.  Dub Taylor, of Western movies fame, also appears as a gas station employee in the beginning of the film.  Only two women with speaking lines are in the movie.  Phyllis Kirk handles her role with aplomb.  Pure joy watching Timothy Carey as Johnny Haslett doing his best, twitching, grinning hooligan.

Some stylish noir scenes including Kirk and Gene Nelson as Steve Lacey (former bad guy now straight) trying to decide whether they should pick up a late night phone call.  All done showing hands only. Crime Wave is a movie worth watching but let's not put it on a pedestal.  It's good but not a classic.
