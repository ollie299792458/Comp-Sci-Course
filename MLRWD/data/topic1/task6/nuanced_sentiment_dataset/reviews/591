Everything about this movie is screwed up.
The Director: Replacing Stephen Sommers with Rob Cohen was the biggest mistake. I can understand if Mr. Sommers refused to direct this movie once he finished reading the script.

The Casts: Rachel Weiz replaced with Maria Bello makes the Evelyn character dull: the joke, the magic conection between Rick and Evelyn as in the prevous 2 movies is lost, I don't know why Rachel refused this project, but I think she made a very smart decision.
Luke Ford, indeed is too old to played the son, he looks more like a brother to Brendan Fraser.

The Talents: A waste of talents, Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh can do more than that, yet the director didn't maximize their talents.
Maria Bello tried so hard to play Evelyn character, but failed. I think she was a great actress, but after seeing her in this movie I changed my mind.

The Visual Effects: A westerner director made an oriental dragon = screwed up in every way, a chinesse dragon doesn't look like that! find an art director who did a research first before creating a movie.

The Script: (Warning: contain spoiler) The story is so stupid and awfull, that is insulted our mind and logic. The biggest joke is when a mummy who can change into an indestructible flying dragon had to change into a flightless beast, and then change back to a human, so that he can be killed by his enemy. Ridiculous!

If you just curious about this movie, rent it before you decided to buy it. For me it's not worth the money, even if the price drop to $1.99.
