It's hard not to like a movie that opens with a geriatric Elvis Presley complaining about a growth on his pecker.

That's exactly where and how Bubba Ho-Tep starts off and the intial goings on are promising.  But shortly afterward the film frankly gets real boring real, real fast.

I've been a fan of Bruce Campbell ever since seeing the first "Evil Dead" in theaters years ago and I admit that his performance as the aging King of Rock N Roll is first rate.  And the movie, which is based on a story by Joe R. Lansdale, a master of Texas-fried horror with a unique comedic southwestern twist, is ripe with possibilties.  But those possibilities just weren't realized and Campbell's charisma isn't enough to make this movie anything more than a well-intentioned oddity.

I got to watch this film as a free rental from my local video store so I didn't feel cheated afterward.  But my advice is this:  Unless you're a diehard Bruce Campbell fan who HAS to own everything the man does, rent before you buy.
