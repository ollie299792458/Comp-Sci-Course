You have got to be kidding me! I read the reviews about how great the DVD was. I was shocked to plainly see the nipples of this woman under her white top throughout the whole DVD.

Wow, what a shocker. No class at all. Do we really have to see a belly button or nipples or too short shorts while doing Yoga for he 30 or 40 minutes. I do not want to see that crap or pay for that either.

Really, is there any reason for that in YOGA?

Not unless you are the husband of this woman. I have to say, what a strange way to present YOGA. The music, what music? The guy's voice was terrible. The look on his face with his eyes rolled back in his head while his half-naked wife is doing yoga behind him.........what is he doing?

I can not imagine giving this DVD as a gift unless I never wanted to see that person again! I did get another DVD, "Warrior (something or other)".  The clothes were better, but the music and the white light this same woman was sitting and exercising on...Oh brother...I think they watch to much of....you get my drift.......Spiritual or Sexual? I am not sure what it was!

I figure that if you like this dynamic duo's other videos you will most likely love the DVD. You have be warned!
