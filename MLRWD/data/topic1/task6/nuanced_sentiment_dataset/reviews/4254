The first match [was bad].  Scotty and Albert aren't a good team but soon Sexay will be back (with his cannabis) to get down! Edge V Regal an average match but WWF should let Regal have gotten more technical like UK fans know he can.  Regal should lose some weight so that he can be quicker and keep up with Edge. Matt VS Jeff BORING.  This match should have been amazing with two high flyers with a well built up rivalry fighting but two many ground moves and not enough extremity along with an unclean finish spoiled it. Dudleyz VS Kane and Big Show quite good match with Stacy getting spanked and a brutal 3D on the exposed turnbuckle.  RVD VS Undertaker since I first saw Van Dam at Invasion I've been a huge mark for this guy and he carried the Taker in this match.  A nice cross body and a chokeslam through two tables were the highlights of this match other than that an OK match (and for once Undertaker sold RVD's moves)  I wish the old fatty would really become the Deadman!  Trish VS Jackie nice puppies but a short match with a pinning combo ending the match (how brutal!) Angle VS Austin the match has been done too often and this was far inferior to Summerslam's excellent effort, no real electricity in this match.  Rock VS Y2J quite good match (thanks to Rocky) screwjob finish, my favourite of the PPV.  Y2J VS 3:16 unusual start with both men out (Y2J Rock Bottomed Stone Cold hit with chair) never really got going and screwjob finish again.  Y2J should wait about a year and get some new gimmicks before he enters the big leagues...
