I saw this with my 11 year old son who had seen the other austin powers movies...  First I have to say it is really REALLY hard to understand why this is rated pg-13 and martix reloaded is an R...it makes no sense to me.  The jokes/language/innuendos (and not subtle enough to be  lost on an 11 year old) are from beginning to the end of the movie. 
The sight gags were pretty funny all the way thru and the beginning of the movie was priceless.  I really thought I was in for a great movie after the first 15 minutes (won;t spoil it by describing it)...  but I think, for me, it went downhill.  I will say that my son totally enjoyed himself the whole way thru.
I think the problem with the movie was that all the other movies were spoofs on 60's spy movies, where as this one seemed to be a spoof of the other austin powers movies.  Maybe it was a subtle difference, but for me it made a huge difference.  The other movies seemed funny as a whole...this one seemed funny only becuase of the sight gags and off the wall (and off color) humor...  Another subtle difference...but it made a ddfference to me.
I have seen the other movies multiple times, this one, just the once.
