Halfway through the initial run of this series, my entire family, my boyfriend, and several friends kept telling me I HAD to start watching Lie to Me, that it was the best show ever.  I didn't really want to start watching yet another TV show, not to mention I don't like jumping into a series in the middle. So, I got the first season for my boyfriend for Christmas, and we watched every episode in two days. It was that good.

The two team leaders, Lightman and Jillian, balance each other well, and while I don't care for the other two team members as much, they each add something unique to the team dynamic.  Lightman's utter brilliance had me wanting to learn more about the field, and I now find myself trying to analyze people's expressions in other TV shows, often referring directly back to Lie to Me.

Unlike most crime dramas or police procedurals, this show doesn't focus solely on murder investigations.  They investigate and help out with other types of cases as well, and that was refreshing for me.  After a while, there are only so many different ways you can see someone killed before you want to just turn off the TV.

The acting is good, the plots are intriguing, and the stuff you learn from watching is absolutely fascinating. I highly recommend this series.
