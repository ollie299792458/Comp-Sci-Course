The actual rank I give this film is 3.5 stars.
If you have a chance to watch this movie and time is not rushing your way - do it. It can all be summed up to a harmless action 'flick' , that offers the viewer a couple of hours with the old Willis' McLain we all know all to well from the 'Diehard' trilogy . In addition to that , you find a kind of routine man plus kid getaway from the bad guys thriller , which is enriched with a secondary interesting (though superficial) dramatization of the autism's syndrome .
The matching of Willis with the child works quite well . My hunch is that this role had turned Night Shyamalan's attention to Willis , this attention ended up in a collaboration that was concluded in Willis' biggest blockbuster to date . This point of view makes the film more interesting , because you get a chance to watch Willis making his first steps in an uncharted territory for him . Eventually this journey brought him also the role in 'Disney's the kid' and of course in 'Unbreakable' , so it's pretty nice to see another brick in his developing career .
Aside from that , the movie is vastly flawed and has lots of holes in the script and plot . I recommend a good and through review of a Canadian writer , that wrote one of the first reviews about this movie and really pointed out  all the defects this product has , in a funny and humorous manner . Nevertheless , for an entertaining movie that doesn't take itself too seriously these are bearable defects you can live with . Sit down , take it easy , enter a somewhat fictitious reality and enjoy 'Mercury Rising' .
