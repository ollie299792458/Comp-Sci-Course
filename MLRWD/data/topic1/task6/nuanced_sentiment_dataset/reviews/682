I was very excited to see this movie.  I love Brittany Murphy and most of her movies.  Plus, with actresses like Holly Hunter and Kathy Bates....I thought it had to be great.  Great actresses, great concept, chick flick.....my favorite!! :)

Well, I was wrong.  I was bored to tears most of this movie.  It wasn't bad acting it was just BORING.  The only time my ears perked up was towards the end...the climax of the movie.  Which only lasts about 15 minutes and then we're back to boring for the remaining 5-10 minutes of the movie.  What a let down.  The climax wasn't even that great it was just the rest of the movie was so dull, anything would've been an improvement.  I can't go into too much detail so I won't ruin it for those who actually want to watch this movie.

Brittany Murphy & Holly Hunter are the only good things about this movie, they deliver great performances with what they are given.

I would suggest watching this if you have ABSOLUTELY nothing else to do.  Otherwise, watching paint dry might be more appealing.
