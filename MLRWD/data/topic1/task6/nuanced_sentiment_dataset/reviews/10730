I could go on and on about movies I watch so I'll try to keep my comments as succinct as possible. A summary isn't necessary unless you're the 1st or 2nd person to review something so I'll get right to the important parts.The book is very good and the film is quite good also. Kingsley is heartbreaking and irritating at the same time. It's a testament to someone's acting if they can make you want to help them and punch them in the nose simultaneously. Connelly, although equally good in lighter fare, has a real gift for portraying these serious and intense women who find themselves in sometimes harrowing circumstances. The woman is also stupendously beautiful, even in the scenes where her character is exhausted, nervous and ill-kempt. Her innate grace as a performer and physical beauty flesh out the character beyond what could have been cliche. It's fantastic to see Connelly as a housecleaner in cutoffs and an old sweater vacuuming some little brat's living room. Yes folks, even blue collar workers can be attractive. Hollywood usually has us believe the opposite, saving these roles for unconventional character actresses. Eldard is a subtle actor who appears as if he could kiss someone and knock out the person next to them in the same second. This warm/cold duality works well for his character. The film as a whole does drag at points and the editing could definitely have been a little more vigorous. Good direction, great cinematography, and a good story. (I wish Connelly had been on the commentary with Kingsley and Perelman, although she does have some interesting scenes on the deleted scenes menu- one where she gest intoxicated in a mexican restaurant is truly fantastic). However, do NOT watch this if you are in a happy or looking to be happy mood. Without any spoilers, this is a very heavy and dense film that can really seep you down along with it. It is truly a downer.
