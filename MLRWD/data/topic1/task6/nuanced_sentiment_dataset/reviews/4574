I've been a big Wilco fan for quite sometime, and I love their last record, "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot".  So I may not be as objective as I should be in reviewing, "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart - A Film About Wilco" which captured the making and distribution of the record.  However, if you're at all interested in seeing how the music industry functions, this film does a wonderful job capturing the chaos and sleaze of the music business.  My favorite scenes in this documentary involve the Spinal Tap-ish encounters Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy has with the press, with industry types and most notably with his band compatriot Jay Bennett, whom is summarily dismissed 60 minutes into the film.  They are very difficult, uncomfortable scenes to watch at times, and certainly give aspiring musicians second thoughts about the profession they are choosing. I was a little disappointed that the remaining band members commentary track with director Sam Jones, avoided commenting about Bennett's contributions to Wilco (at one point of the commentary, during one of the more bizzare non-confrontations Tweedy has with Bennett, the whole band walks out leaving Jones to explain the dynamic of their relationships).  Still, if you're any kind of music fan, watching the creative process is mesmirizing.  If you're a Wilco fan, this is a must have. The DVD features lots of bonus footage and music by the band, and hearing the original or alternate versions of "Kamera", "Poor Places" and "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart" are really ear opening.  I'll never listen to "Heavy Metal Drummer" again without thinking of the Tweedy/Bennett spat.  All in all, this is a really entertaining documentary that proves the old addage; life is stranger than fiction.
