When I first caught this movie on cable I was flipping channels and the ambience immediately attracted me.  The use of dark colors is beautiful and gives you the feel of watching a home movie almost. The underlying emotion and attitude was so strong that I could tell right away that it was going to have a profound message.  I was compelled to watch it.

It was astonishing in its honesty.  So many things about both of the girls struck a chord with me.  I felt like I could relate completely in my own teenage experiences.

After a while I stopped relating and was suddenly terrified.  I'm not a teenager anymore.  These things are not ok.  They're dangerous and it scares the heck out of me that not only did I do some of these things, but as a parent, my own children could be doing these things... and they might not be as lucky or as smart as I was to get away from them.

What scares me even more about this film is that if I had seen it as a teenager I would have thought it was cool.  I might even have tried some of the things I hadn't already or been encouraged to do more of what I had.  I would not have the experience I have now to realize the severe emotional and physical reprecussions that engaging in these types of activity can cause.

All in all I strongly recommend you see it, espeically if you are a parent.  I think it would be a really good idea to watch and discuss it with your kids.  Obviously not every kid is susceptible to these ideas, but when did quality time ever hurt?
