You know what it's like when you find a film that no matter what time of day or night it comes on you just have to sit and watch.  Even better when you find a film and its sequel that both fit this catergory.  This is how I felt about Tremors and Tremors 2.  When I found out that Stampede Entertainment was making a third one, I'll admit my hope's shot through the roof.  If they used the same care and understanding they used to make Tremor's 2, the completion of the trilogy could only meet with success, alas this was not the case.  Don't get me wrong the film was watchable, but unfortunatly, lacking that special something that made the first two films true classics.  Maybe it was the obvious cheap CGI graboids, or the characters that you just didn't seem to want to care for, or possibly the proposterous 3rd generation creatures, that were laughingly unfrightning.  Let's hope that if they investigate the possibility of doing a fourth one, the people from Stampede might do themselves a favor and rewatch the first one, and then the third one, and make some notes on what works and what doesn't.  This movie was really a big let down.
