Haunting in Connecticut is a decent horror flick, and given that horror films are mostly abject tripe, that is saying a lot. The plot is well paced, without the rubbishey `its just the cat moments' or prolonged character development that doesn't help us like the characters at all and the special effects and settings are creepy as they should be.

Speaking of character development, Haunting in Connecticut is a step above most. Our main character Matt is a teenage cancer sufferer, which puts an interesting twist on the supernatural activity as hallucinations are potential side effects of his experimental treatment or cancer spreading to his brain. Matt's father is a recovering alcoholic which also adds tension to the story (although to be honest is only tokeniscally explored)

Of course, this movie isn't perfect. While well executed the plot is entirely derivative - almost arbitrary. A (somewhat) nuclear family moves into a house which is extra cheap because of its `history'. Strange events start to ensue, and once the family accepts that something supernatural is going on, research is conducted at the local library where-upon it is discovered that a creepy old guy used to conduct necromonic experiments in their basement and a priest is called upon to help.

While the scares are well timed, they get a little repetitive - essentially all being bogeyman suddenly appearing coupled with atonal violin screeches. And as mentioned before the plot doesn't build beyond the well-known old man experimenter theme (although they play a bit of `just whose ghost is haunting us?')

Overall Haunting in Connecticut is probably just a good typical horror for a couple of hours of non-thinking time, don't expect the wheel to get reinvented.
