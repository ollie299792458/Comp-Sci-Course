In 1968 George A. Romero and John A. Russo co-wrote a little film called Night of the Flesh Eaters, which ultimately became Night of the Living Dead.

George A. Romero directed this black and white bleak and suspensful film about dead bodies who get up and walk around and eat the flesh of the living.

Night of the Living Dead is not your regular run of the mill basement made $3.25 zombie flick. Night of the Living Dead is a devastating satire displaying the African-American lead as the iscolated outsider. Once you have seen the hunt scene towards the end of the film, and know about the freedom marches and civil rights struggles in those days, you will understand excactly what I am talking about.

Night of the Living Dead has a nice patch job of music, great atmosphere, characters, and really gives the tone of dread and chlostrophobia.

Although films like White Zombie (1933, Bela Lugosi) were out before Night of the Living Dead, there was never a "zombie" film like it and there was never one after it either. Night of the Living Dead remains an all time classic American film. It is part of film history, which makes it part of American history, being that movies play such a huge role in our culture.
