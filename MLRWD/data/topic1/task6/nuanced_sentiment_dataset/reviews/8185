A proud, patriotic Algerian (now living comfortably somewhere like France, California, Sweden -somewhere far away from the hell hole that is modern day Arab Algeria) Shouts slogans

"Terrorists! so were called those Algerians fighting for their land, for their freedom. Even Italian partiggiani were called so once :-). How shall we call the colonial French then? "

Yeah, yeah, your people fought for "freedom", "self determination" against "racism" colonialism blah, blah, blah (Note there is not a lot of "diversity" in modern day Algeria were everyone who wasn't Arab Muslim has been murdered, ethnically cleansed, driven into the sea. )

The best party of the great movie the Battle of Algiers is that the director, while being obviously sympathetic to the Arab Muslim side, doesn't fall into this blind, lying PC propaganda. He shows the struggle from both sides. And the director shows the truth that the leaders of the FLN were terrorists, featuring low life, criminals like the pimp, petty thief Ali-la-Pointe. While the director does not present the FLN atrocities against French Pied Noir children in Philippeville in 1955 or show the FLN's policy of targeting moderate Arabs with murder, the Battle of Algiers does show the reality of modern wars where terrorism against civilians is the main  battle strategy of those trying to overthrow the existing order.

I recommend people view and study the movie the Battle of Algiers and understand what makes angry, alienated, hateful losers like Ali-Le Pointe or the DC Sniper seek revenge and immortality by living a life of murder and terrorism.

Note that radical Muslim groups are recruiting heavily in America's prisons - also in European and British prisons. The West will see many, many more Ali-Le Pointes and we will see if the West has any Gen  Massus or Paul Aussaresses to fight terror with terror.

Again, 5 stars for the best movie about modern war - fair and balanced like Fox news (not :-)
