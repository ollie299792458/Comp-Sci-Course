Wow, where do I start? I expected this film to be bad, but still had to see it. OUCH! This was the mother of all bad movies- it sucked way further than I even expected!

I have a right to this opinion because a. I always give sequels a chance (Cruel Intentions 3 kicked ass) and b. I'm a die hard Crow fan.

But i hafta echo the guy that put "I want my 90 minutes back" in his review. This film absolutly sucked. The storyline and actors lacked talent, intensity, passion.

Did they even see the original "Crow" film? This seemed to take the p***.

The line "Quote the raven mother f*****!" made me cringe internally and externally.

Crow 3 at least tried a different spin and different method of getting the face. Crow 4 Wicked Prayer had no originality at all.

Trust me, don't waste your time. They should leave "The Crow" to rest in peace now, after this sequal so badly abuses it. Crow 2 and 3 where good attempts.

The worst thing is, internet rumours are spreading whispers of a Crow 5 with the Crow being female (been there done that very well in the series).

The Original is the best- the next best thing being The Crow - Stairway to Heaven TV series because it stays extremely faithful to the first movie, using Eric Draven and his story, extending it with fantastic content. Now that is worth a watch if you can get your hands on it!

I hope Brandon didn't see.
