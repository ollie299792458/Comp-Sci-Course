I read a lot of reviews about this movie before I picked it up; the stories of its strong and graphic content and intensity had piqued my interest.  To be blatantly honest, however, I was disappointed.

This was a good movie; don't misunderstand that.  It was interesting and curious, well acted and all that; In that respect, I enjoyed it.  However, I was let down in that it is not, NOT the graphically violent film that you might have been lead to believe it is.  Yes, there is some violence, and it is a bit intense, but really only a bit; nothing more than you might see in any other 'horror' or 'thriller' type movie out there.  You expect it.  But this movie shouldn't be made out to be one of those movies.  It isn't senselessly violent; its about realistic situations and people.  While it escalates to an extreme point in the end, I wouldn't suggest going into this movie with the intent of seeing a "violent movie".

The first review I read about this told me to "stop reading here and just watch".  I think I should have; I suggest the same to you.  Take the movie as its surface, don't think into it, and just let it happen for you.  You'll enjoy it much more by discarding the expectations that are being tossed around it.
