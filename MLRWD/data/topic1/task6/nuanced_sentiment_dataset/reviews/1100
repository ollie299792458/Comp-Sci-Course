I LOVED the old Don Adams / Barbara Feldon TV show, grew up watching reruns of it all the time; and I've enjoyed Anne Hathaway in various roles, so I figured I would enjoy this movie, too.

WELL, expecting this to ANYTHING like the old "real" Get Smart is right out.  There were a few attempted gags that tried to make it similar, but they were so terribly FORCED and so poorly executed that they failed miserably.  I later read that Steve Carell actively avoided seeing the REAL Get Smart, because he didn't want to, I dunno, try to force himself to be like Don Adams?  How stupid could he be?  Carell should be strapped to a chair and made to watch Don Adams over and over and over until gets down and prays for Don Adams to forgive him for butchering the Maxwell Smart character like this!

Steve Carell can be a funny guy, but he was BAD BAD BAD beyond bad AWFUL ROTTEN in this.  The little Asian guy (Masi Oka) from Heroes acts circles around Carell in this.  Patrick Warburton is usually a one-man cancellation crew (i.e. if he's in a show, he's so bad that the whole show gets cancelled), but compared to Steve Carell as Max, Warburton seems like an Academy Award winner.

Anne Hathaway does pretty okay in a very poorly written role for Agent 99.  She doesn't shine like she did in the Princess Diaries, but she didn't have much to work with here, and Carell only sucked it all the harder.

Unbelievably, Dwayne The Rock Johnson CARRIES this movie.  I know, right?  Who would ever think Rock would roll like this?  Okay, he gets some help from Alan Arkin and Masi Oka, and even a little from Anne Hathaway, but The Rock is The Man in Get Smart.  If he's not in there, this doesn't even get one star.

To sum it up:  it's cute, but it's not "Get Smart".  Steve Carell is awful, and nearly pulls the rest of the cast down with him.  Anne Hathaway is hot, and can shine with good writers, but her acting was just okay here.  But The Rock really can act a little bit!
