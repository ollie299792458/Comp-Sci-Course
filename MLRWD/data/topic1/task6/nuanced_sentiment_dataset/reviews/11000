If it was up to you to give a dying friend 10 extra years of life, would you do it? If you could cure a loved one of a dreadful disease, would you grant that favor? Will you do it for yourself? Don't stop reading, start watching. I used to be suspicious, doubtful, cautious. Much of the information in the video goes against the health and nutrition teaching I received in nursing school. But that's also where I learned to look at the validity of honest research data. Allow yourself a mere 1 and 1/2 hour of intense, truthful factual, super encouraging information, and if you're not convinced that you can easily vastly improve your health, quality of life, and longevity, and that of your children, then all you lost is 90 minutes. If you don't watch this, you risk missing out on adding fun filled, active, joyful years with mental clarity to your life. I'm confident you'll look back on your decision to purchase Forks over Knives as one of the best ones you've ever made. Please choose to live long and prosper.
