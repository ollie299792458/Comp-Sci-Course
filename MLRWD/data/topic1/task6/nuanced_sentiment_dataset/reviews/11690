I agree with the other reviewers about the camera work - it's pathetic! Personally I don't buy the nonsense about "oh well, the sound is good so it makes up for it". The point is that I am buying a DVD which is a visual product not a CD, so the emphasis is on the picture being good as well as the sound. Don't get fooled by those that say it doesn't bother you, it does! You feel like tuning your tv set the entire time. Just watch the two Dream Theater DVD'S "Score" and "Live At Budokan", the picture quality is outstanding.

As for the rest of the DVD. Yes the show is not bad and the playing is good, but there are a few things that annoy me.

1.Harmonies are left out on some songs (or you can't hear them)

2.Playing is sometimes sloppy (keyboards)

3.Joey leaves out the trademark high notes on a lot of the songs

As a guitar player I think the biggest dissapointment was when John Norum failed dismally on reproducing the solo on "Ready or Not", which was originally played by Kee Marcello on the album. I have always enjoyed Kee more than John, they are both good, but I think Kee was technically more of a virtuoso.

All in all it's an average DVD, please don't give this one a 5 just for the sake of nostalgia. Luckily I bought this on a reward system from my local cd store, I would of been annoyed if I had payed full price for this one.
