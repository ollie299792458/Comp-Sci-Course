I got this movie for christmas, and let me tell you, it makes a great gift! This is sort of like the movie "BIG" with Tom Hanks. This movie really made me laugh, and I probably saw it a million times! Jenna is a 13 year old girl who deals with everyday middle school problems. It's the day of her birthday party and she is happy that the popular people are coming. But it doesn't turn out that well. The popular people don't like her, and she has gotten in a huge fight with her best friend. Jenna really wants to be 30 because maybe then everything would be better, or so that's what a magazine says. So she sprinkles some wishing dust on herself, and wishes that she is 30. Her wish comes true, along with all the other things that she's wanted! Jenna works for her favorite magazine, she became friends with the popular girl, she is very sucessful, and rich. But does having all of this make Jenna happy? Or has she missed the really important things in life? Jenna soon finds out that she has not turned out to be a good person. Is getting what you want you always the best thing? This is a wonderful movie filled with humor and romance. Anyone will love this movie!
