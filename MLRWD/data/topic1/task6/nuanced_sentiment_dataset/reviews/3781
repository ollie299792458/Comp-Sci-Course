I am a huge classic rock fan I listen to all the classic rock bands an example of that is Jimi Hendrix. I have every CD and DVD of Hendrix I study this guy I love this guy. I went to Giant Eagle to rent some movies one day and I saw this one titled HENDRIX. I was excited to see what it had in store for me latter I found out it had nothing in store for me. This movie is the worst movie you could possibly watch this movie just brings HENDRIX down 100% its an insult the way they casted the actor who was supposed to be Jimi Hendrix. This whole movie brings the wrong example of how Jimi Hendrix got started alot of it is made up. Ya I understand they could not have the orginal rights to the Hendrix songs for the movie so they had a band play Hendrix  but boy the band sucked&gt;&gt;it just maded this DVD go further down hill wow. If you never heard of Jimi Hendrix and want to buy this then dont because you will get lead on the wrong way. In the future I am sure they will come out with a better movie of Jimi Hendrix the cast will be better so will the music. The actors in this movie sucked this movie is as worst as it can get. You can believe me or not on this but im telling my 100% truth dont buy this. I do have something you may want to look into of buying Jimi Hendrix to get started on DVD buy Experience Hendrix you will love it. p.s. check out my other reviews!
