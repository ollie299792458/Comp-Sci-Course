ok this dvd, this story is great. if you are a young wrestling fan (like myself, im 22)than this dvd is a must. it is just so awesome. pretty much if you have the rise and fall of wcw, the monday night wars,the rise and fall of ecw, and this dvd....than well you have a HUGE chunk of wrestling history, and can learn ALOT. the story on this dvd is about how the AWA pretty much made the mold for the 80s wrestling boom. Verne gagne almost single handed created all the stars who would move on to make WWF. hogan,grahm,slaughter,jesse the body,mean genne,HBK,crusher,mad dog,dusty rhodes....the list goes on. they all went through AWA, and almost all of them were molded there. this also tells the story of when mcmahon started his hostle take over, how the AWA, and NWA tried to join forces to slow vince down. i cant really explain how great this dvd, and story is. i thought i knew alot about wrestling, but i learned alot seeing this. if your a fan who is interested in the history of the biz...you almost have to have this. plus there is a 2nd disc with matchs and outtakes.
