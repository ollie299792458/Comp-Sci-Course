I may not be "artsy" enough to grasp some intended higher message and I am not sure if this film was intended to make you feel disgust at what the daughter goes through with righteous indignation or not but I hope everyone who watched this film felt righteous indignation. One reviewer or commentor mentioned maybe it was the author of the books intention to point out what white South African's are allowing themeselves to go through is basically out of control but that's not the impression I had after watching the movie. I came out with a sense that it was portrayed as it's ok for a young white female to be gang raped by 3 black south african youth's and mistreated and have her father set on fire and to just cave in and accept it as "the way things are". The entire time I watched this movie I was hoping to see retribution by the father of the young woman as one would expect a loving father to do but alas, the father and daughter accept there mistreatment at the hands of their black African neighbors. I don't know if the author of the book/movie director was trying to say "hey, these evil white oppressors deserve this" or "Hey, stand up for yourself as it's as much your country (whites) as theirs (blacks)" but I'll leave that debate to others. Either way, all in all the movie gets a C- and I think there are too many great movies out there to waste your time with a C- minus movie but I will see concede this movie will stir a lot of emotions in you and make you think so on that aspect alone it has SOME redeeming qualities.
