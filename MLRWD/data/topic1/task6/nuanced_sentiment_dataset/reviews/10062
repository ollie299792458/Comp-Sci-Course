I must say that I have this directors cut on VHS, but I am sure the quality is better on DVD. I saw Pink Floyd's Dark Side tour in 1973 and they performed all of the songs included here, except the take off on Seamus with the dog ( it is a treat). To me, this documents Pink Floyd's moment of ascension into their musical glory. I actually saw this underrated film on PBS back in 1975! The editorial reviewer hit the nail on the head with his cultural discription- completely in synch with seeing themself as "Relics" from the 1967 scene in London and San Francsico and wanted to break free of that stigma. A fate which the band managed to cheat!

 Truely, what is astounding to me is just what exceptional musicains these guys are! As when I saw them live, I was astounded that they could put on such an effective live show without studio manipulation. This movie also shows us this. The playing is what it is about. The dress is dated but WHO CARES! People are dressing that way again (gag)! Ignore the cheese and really HEAR the music! Excellent, EXCELLENT film!
