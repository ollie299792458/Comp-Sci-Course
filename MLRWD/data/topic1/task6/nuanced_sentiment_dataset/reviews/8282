As always, the product arrived promptly and in perfect condition. But upon reading the previous reviews for this package (most notably "A collection of Price's better horror films plus extra features, July 26, 2007. By  calvinnme "Texan refugee") I got the impression there were more films on this disc besides the featured 2 movies. Read if you will and you will see what I mean.
The package I received was a flip disc with 'Abominable' on one side and 'Rises Again' on the other. Both were very good quality and worth adding to my collection, but again when I consider what I thought I was getting, I feel slightly cheated (hence the 3 star rating, but that has nothing to do with the quality of what you do get)
So be warned, only 2 films in this package, but if you are looking to add these 2 Price films to your collection reasonably, this is the way to go. Price had a quality, be it serious or over the top camp, that few seem to have today and this is a excellent demonstration of his talents.

As a fan, I would suggest Hollywood take a look of the mechanics of these 2 films when it comes to making sequels. Same actors (with the exception of 'Vulnavia', but since her physical body was destroyed in the first film, you can forgive the fact a different person played her in film 2) and references to the previous film. The two parts flowed together and were not forced like some of Hollywood's recent efforts just to crank out new product to make a buck.

Trivia note: there was talk of making a third (and supposed) final film of the Phibes character under the working title 'The Brides of Dr Phibes' back in the day but it never happened (damn it!)
