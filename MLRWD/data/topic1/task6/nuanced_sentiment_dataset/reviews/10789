This movie isn't that bad at the beginning. I am a big fan of the post-apocalyptic genre. I liked the beginning of the movie because it kind of resembled the way in which the road warrior was portrayed. The protagonist was a lone wanderer in the desert, and he did not depend on anybody to survive in the wasteland. The movie changes completely when the protagonists becomes the postman. It seems that the movie changes from the nuclear wasteland theme to a western theme. The movie becomes very cheese when the postman arrives at the town. At times, the movie becomes a kind of western soap opera. In conclusion, the description of the movie is very misleading. This movie is a very cheesy western. I liked some parts of the movie though, especially the beginning, and that is why i am giving it an extra star. I guess that if you like westerns you can like this movie more than i did. However, this movie is a very mediocre "western". What i can assure you is that you will laugh at how ridicule the plot is.
