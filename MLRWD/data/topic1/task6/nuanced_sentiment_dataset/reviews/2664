OK with regards Marked for Death, which is probably the worst of Seagal's infamous "First Four", as film historians generally refer to Seagal's early career- here we have a man who is driven into retirement out of the guilt he feels for the countless innocent people he has murdered on the job in order to catch the bad guy, the many informants he has fornicated with, and the death of his recent partner. Seagal's character has become worn down by the rigors of police life and he returns to the home of his sister to find peace. Of course, his sister's perfect life is shattered the minute he moves in, as a ruthless Jamaican drug posse shoots up the home and severely injuries Seagal's niece. This of course leads to Seagal reassuming the lifestyle he previously indicated he was leaving 20 minutes earlier in order to become a decent human. Seagal, having given up on this attempt after perhaps a day, takes up arms with his partner, a football coach who somehow manages to obtain a leave of absence in order to travel to Jamaica and slaughter countless dreads, and the laundry list of death begins. Top quotes include:

"God made men"

"I want Hatcha DEAD!"

"One thought he was invincible the other thought he could fly.... they were both wrong"

Mindless fun, but what do you expect?
