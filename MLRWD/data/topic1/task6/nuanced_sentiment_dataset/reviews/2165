It all started in 1992 with Batman The Animated Series, and the brilliant, creative, and ground breaking team members such as Bruce Timm, Hilary Bader, Paul Dini, Andrea Romano, and so many others.  That show created a ripple effect that resulted in many more comic-to-cartoon transformations for Batman and Superman in years to come.  The Justice League is one of the last and latest.

A few years after Batman and Superman have been doing their thing in their respective cities, they eventually band together to form a team as a reaction to larger global threats in the world of super villainy.

To hardcore fans of Bruce Timm's animated series adaptations, not all of Justice League season 1 measures up to their expectations, but kids will love it just the same.  There are a few gems in this season's set which make it worth buying, but weary parents may want to sample it first before buying the entire season.

You can easily rent "Justice League: Secret Origins" from the kids section of your favorite rental place.  It's the same three episodes that you can find on the season 1 box set.  Watch it with your kids. The action is clean and isn't too gratuitous, so I see this season, and show in general, to be a good way to keep the kids busy with something they'd like, if they're into superheroes.
