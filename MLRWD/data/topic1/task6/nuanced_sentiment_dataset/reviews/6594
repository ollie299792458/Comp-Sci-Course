A more appropriate name would be, "Eat, Pray, Love & Sleep." Unfortunately, this was the movie I most wanted to see when it came out on DVD. Thank you, again, Red Box for saving me from spending 20 dollars on a movie I would likely never watch again.

In the beginning we are introduced to a woman who is having a perpetual life crisis. Never being happy or finding her hearts content. Common story for just about EVERYBODY I KNOW. How they went about resolving her dilemma was just not that interesting. Her trip to Italy was relatively uneventful and the lesson to gain from it was to eat what you want and buy bigger pants. Basically, we got that from the watching previews. Then in India, she didn't find anything beyond that either.

I was hoping for her to find some degree of benefit from each location, putting it all together in the end to become a whole, happy person. None of this actually happened.

The last trek to Bali was when it got interesting and is the ONLY reason I give this movie three stars. The adventure and love story there was filled with interesting characters that finally made the movie more interesting than watching paint dry. Javier Bardem really brought something into the movie that simply didn't exist before. He played a great character and his acting was done very well. I liked this entire segment. If only the entire movie would have been like the last third.

Rent it. Then decide if it is worth it. I see some people felt it was worth five stars. I envy them. I just can't live in that world. If you want to really enjoy a great "Finding Myself" chick flick, get "Under the Tuscan Sun" instead.
