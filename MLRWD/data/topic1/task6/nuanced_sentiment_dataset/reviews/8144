THIS IS NOT THE DIRECTORS CUT.

I give the Directors Cut 5 stars, and ordinarily I would give even the edited version at least 4, but when I purchased "The Oliver Stone Collection" edition of this movie, I assumed the movie contained therein would be the Directors Cut.  IT IS NOT.

The deleted scenes are great to have, but those scenes were also contained in the old beat-up VHS of NBK I owned years and years ago and lost.  Attempting to replace it (my DIRECTORS CUT version), I bought this one on DVD.  I was extremely disappointed that this is not the version I had come to love.

Very little of the movie is deleted, but purists seeking to obtain the TRUE version of this movie should stay away.  Remember when Robert Downey Jr. gets a hole shot in his hand?  Gone (or at least cut away far faster than it's supposed to).  Remember when Tommy Lee Jones gets his head mounted on a stick?  Gone.  These are just two examples.

For those of you specifically seeking the Directors Cut, this is not it.  I love this movie to death, but I was looking for something specific and did not get it.  Very misleading labeling, if you ask me.
