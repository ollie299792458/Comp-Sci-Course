On the back of the case for these Legend Films DVD's, it states "The Killer Shrews has been beautifully restored".  If so, why didn't they use that print on the DVD?  What is on the disc is the worst example of a "restored" film I have ever seen.  There are multiple bad splices, a section of film with extreme damage, and while the actual picture quality is sharper there is just too much minor damage(lines, etc.).  If they are going to "restore" a film, they should at least start with a decent print.  I've seen a print of this on a budget 50-movie pack that didn't have the splices and damage that this had(although the picture wasn't as sharp).  This is in full screen and I understand it was filmed that way.  The print for The Giant Gila Monster is better.  It looks like it has been cleaned up but I wouldn't call it a restoration.  The picture quality is sharper and there are no bad splices.  This is a full screen version of an originally widescreen film.  I understand Image has a widescreen version.  Legend continues its tradition of releasing good films in multilated form, showing a complete lack of caring for the film and for the consumer.  I was hoping for a good release of these B/W films, but my hopes were again dashed by Legend.  If they could just manage to put out a decent release of the B/W films, I could put up with their despicable colorization of them(of which I never have and never will watch a colorized film).  The films themselves, I have no problems with.
