Okay, "The Fugitive" had your standard action-pic thrills and a pretty good performance by Tommy Lee Jones. But really, this is a lousy movie for three reasons.
1. It's only about a guy running from the law and trying to clear his name. That was never the point of the TV series -- the series was all about putting the character into situations where he'd be thrown in with the poor or oppressed people of America -- abused women, Mexican farm workers, black brutality victims, the people who never showed up on "Father Knows Best." It was a show with a tremendous sense of adventure and conscience, whereas the movie chickens out, cuts the guts out of the "Fugitive" concept and just turns it into a will-he-or-won't-he-survive cliffhanger. It's mentally empty Hollywood schlock. Which would be fine if they hadn't called it "The Fugitive."
2. The train crash at the beginning (and in the trailer, so I'm not giving anything away) -- he really survived that? Give me a break.
3. When we find out the reason why somebody has hatched this evil plot against him, it's laughable. I'm sorry, this scheme would just never have happened in life -- it would easily have been found out and there's no incentive for someone to have cooked it up in the first place. This is lame screenwriting.
