Perhaps I had too high expectations for this movie.  I kept waiting for something either not predictable or edgy to happen, but the payoff never seems to materialize.  It certainly isn't the fault of the actors who play their respective parts well.  Nicole Kidman plays this part with the same intensity and passion as one of her best parts in the movie, "To Die For."  Physically she is perfect to play what is in essence a Russian prostitute/scam artist.
Ben Chaplin character of the frustrated lonely bank teller of 10 years is down pat for most of the movie.  His sarcasm, wit, and mood swings once he finds out the truth about Nicole's scam is dead on.  But the script itself has no hidden secrets.  You know from the previews all along that Ben's character is going to be set up.  There are a few twists thrown in but for the most part you knew everything that was coming.  I found the ending to be completely unbelievable.  Ben Chaplin's final decision is just way to out of character and you almost get the impression they shot about 4 different endings, previewed them all and took the easy way out.
There are worse ways to waste 90 minutes but its best to watch without lofty expectations.
