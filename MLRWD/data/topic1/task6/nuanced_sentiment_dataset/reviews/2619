I saw this flick in a cafe-theater (glad I had something besides the movie to pay attention to).  I have thoroughly enjoyed previous Coen Bros. films like "Fargo" and "No Country For Old Men," so I held high expectations for "Burn After Reading".  Alas, this is a throw-away, unrepresentative of the Coen opus.  The story is disjointed, and the characters unlikeable.  Attempts at the Coens' trademark dark humor abound, but most fall flat.  Irony is everwhere in this movie, with perhaps the most ironical being it's a so-so movie made by a great team.

BTW, I thought Brad Pitt's performance of a not-too bright jock stereotypical but *awesomely* done.  He was truly funny and multi-dimensional in this supporting role, and I'm not a huge fan of his normally.  The other actors appeared oddly one-dimensional, especially considering their capabilites: Malkovitch raging, Swinton cooling, Clooney drooling, and McDormand simply kinda sad.

Again I'm glad I saw this in a cafe-theater.  At least the tiramisu with coffee was good.  This movie is a miss.
