When I saw the previews for this film I figured it would be a great way to spend two hours.  After I had spent my two hours with Mel and Helen, I wanted them back.  
If you have seen any trailer for this film, then you have seen the best and funniest parts.  The "funny" scenes in this film were not funny at all.  I understand that this is a romantic comedy and all but, Mel gibson seems awkward throughout the entire movie.  I was upset that Helen Hunt, a woman that performed beautifully in As Good as it Gets, even chose the role in this film. 
From the beginning a viewer already knows the outcome of the movie.  We all know that the man's life will change because of this accident.  The concept of hearing what women think, as far-fetched as it is, is interesting.  I only wish someone could have been a little more creative with it.  
The movie also goes to great extremes to waste good talent.  Marisa Tomei plays a mindless woman worring about petty things.  Delta Burke plays Gibson's "yes girl" and could have given much more to the picture. 
I don't expect an epic like Braveheart or an action film like Twister every time these two are on the screen.  I just want something that is entertaining.  The best part of this film goes to the set decorators and designers.
The film does prove one thing; we should all listen to our mothers when they tell us not to plug in a hairdryer near a tub full of water.
