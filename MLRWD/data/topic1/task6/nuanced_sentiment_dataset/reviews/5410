I'm a fan of the first two Terminator films.  T2 is a brilliant piece of cinema, in terms of both special effects and plot.  The character development in the script, and the subsequent performances by the actors, was leveraged superbly by director and franchise creator Jim Cameron.  Even Ah-nold kept it together enough to portray a cyborg as something more than a one-dimensional machine.

So it was with some anticipation that I purchased the (hopefully) LAST installment in the Terminator franchise: Terminator Salvation.  It's depressing to note that, for the $200 million it cost to make this film, 500 college students could have had a 4-year free ride to Stanford, and we as a species would be significantly closer to a cure for cancer.

Alas, not so.  This film is devoid of any perceivable cinematic value, other than as an excuse to blow stuff up for two hours.  Given that director McG is famous for pyrotechnic stunts and infamously weak in plot and character development, I should have known what to expect.  But here's what I didn't expect:

****** WARNING: SPOILER ALERTS ******

-- Endless cheesy homages to the original Terminator films: "Come with me if you want to live;" "I'll be back;" fleeing from danger in a mini-camper; one-armed shotgun pumping (btw, Sarah Connor did it because her other arm was BROKEN, not because it was "cool," Anton); a factory battle-to-the-death featuring molten steel and a "frozen" terminator; and, sadly, more.

-- Endless cheesy homages to classic films in general.  The elevator ride in the big climax before Skynet goes (predictably) boom, a la Sigourney Weaver in Aliens; McG's own characterization of the escape of Markus, Star, and Kyle Reese from the ill-fated desert gas station (oh, and yeah--just like in T2--a boy, a female, and a cyborg seek shelter in an abandoned desert GAS STATION) as being "like the Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow" in the Wizard of Oz, in which they "ease on down" (The Wiz) "the yellow brick road" (The Wizard of Oz) in their escape (I'm surprised he failed to liken the motobots chasing after them as flying monkeys).  Disturbing, however, was McG's literal on-camera reference to a moment in which cyborg Markus heads into danger instead of fleeing as being "just like the firefighters in 911, who we homaged in that scene" (I kid you not -- see the Blu-ray theatrical release disc's extra features).

-- The inability of Sam Worthington to decide whether he should deliver his lines with an American accent, or his native Australian accent; and the inability of McG to direct him either way (maybe he was elsewhere on set blowing stuff up).

-- Christian Bale's mono-dimensional performance of John Connor, in which he appeared less animated than a T-600 and uninspired to deliver his lines in any voice other than a hoarse shout.

-- The completely galling, almost giddy revelation of Anthony Simonaitis, the Key Powder Foreman (again, watch the movie's popup-enhanced Blu-ray version) that, while filming the gas station demolition scene in New Mexico, "we had to keep a 50-feet column of fire (burning) for 2 more days; (so we) built a steel framework, hooked that up to a fuel tanker ... and burned 2000 gallons of fuel over the course of 2 days."

McG: The Ozone Layer just called; it wants its atmosphere back.

If there was an Oscar for Blowing Stuff Up, Terminator Salvation would be Academy-worthy.  Otherwise, this film represents nothing more than $200 million up in smoke.
