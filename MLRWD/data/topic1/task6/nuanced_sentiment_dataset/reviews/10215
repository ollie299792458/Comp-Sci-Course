After the release of JAWS in 1975, Steven Spielberg became the most popular director in Hollywood. People were wondering what he would do for his next picture, he already knew! Steven Spielberg had wrote a script called CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND when he was 18 years old. He tried to get the movie made, but no studios wanted to take their chance with an unknown director with such a big project. With JAWS becoming the highest-grossing movie of all-time, Steven set himself to direct his movie. The movie was bought by Columbia Pictures who was facing some financial difficulties at the time. The project was given a $20 million budget, which was extremely high at the time. Steven hired again Richard Dreyfuss to play the lead role. Principal photography of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND started in November of 1975 and continued through 1976. The production was extremely big and had many technical problems. For the special effects, Steven hired ILM to produce some of the most amazing special effects in movie history. Before the release of the movie, people were pessimistic at the idea of the movie saying it was too science-fiction, but when CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND opened on November 17th, 1977, critics were all agreeing to say that the movie was a masterpiece. The movie grossed $166 million domesticlly, becoming the second-highest grossing movie of 1977 just behind STAR WARS, who beated JAWS as the highest-grossing movie of all-time. CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND was nominated many times at the 1978 Academy Awards and garnered Steven Spielberg a Best Director nomination, something that JAWS didn't do. The movie was re-released in 1982 and then released on VHS in 1988 as CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND : THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION. In 2001, it was released as a collector's two-disc DVD edition containing many bonus features.
