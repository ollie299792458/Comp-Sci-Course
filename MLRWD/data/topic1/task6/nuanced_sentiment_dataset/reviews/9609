Rented this movie on Redbox, and liked it so much I went out and bought the DVD to see the bonus features.  Now I've watched it straight through four times, watched the full commentary once, and watched all of the bonus features.  IMO, this is the best horror movie to come out in years.  As you may have heard, it has funny moments that satirize the horror movie genre, but never at the expense of the actual horror.  Make no mistake - this movie is not a straight parody, nor is it a farce.  Rather, it credits the viewer with a certain awareness of the conventions of the horror genre, acknowledges them, then delivers some real horror that seems fresh and real.  That's a tricky tightrope to walk, but the producers, directors and cast of this movie pull it off in spades.  This is a movie that rewards repeated viewings.  I've noticed something new every time I've watched it.  It has wit, and it has grit.  If you like fresh, original horror, give this movie a shot.  There are a few other horror movies I've enjoyed as much, but none more.
