TP&M2 is definitely not remotely comparable to the original, but on its own, if you're willing to suspend disbelief that Kam Heskin's Paige could have the gravitas to be a medical student, it's fun enough to watch.  The film has a silly but entertaining enough plotline lifted straight from The Princess Diaries 2, as laws of succession suddenly interfere with the royal marriage plans.  Unlike the original TP&M, which was a romantic drama focused on character development sprinkled with a few comedic moments, this film is a slapstick romantic comedy featuring physical comedy and minimal character development.  Luke Mably, who was terrific in his performance as the prince in the original, adeptly transitioning from reckless playboy to clueless college student to regal ruler, is given little to do other than to look pretty, furrowing his brow whenever problems arise in his relationship with Paige.  Paige as portrayed by Heskin is a likable enough heroine, if a bit of a lightweight compared to her devious rival, the Princess Kirsten of Norway played by Clemency Burton-Hill, who is trying to steal Edvard (and the title of Queen of Denmark) away.  Mably and Heskin don't generate the heat that he and Stiles shared in the original, but you still root for Paige to hold on to her man as she struggles to fit into to royal society while surrounded by sharks.  Kirsten's battles with Paige and her ultimate comeuppance at the hands of Edvard's trusted manservant Soren (played with great humor by Jonathan Firth) are probably the highlights of the film.
