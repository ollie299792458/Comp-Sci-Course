Luc Besson's sense of humor throughout the movie is just the right amount of seasoning which softens the dramatic beginning. Jean Reno (Enzo) perfectly performs a Sicilian character competing his old friend Jacques who both witness Jacques' father never coming out of the sea while sponge diving back in their childhood. It triggers Jacques to dive and disconnetcs him from the earth where he thinks he finds love and life under the water subconsicously looking out for his father. When Enzo calls out for a competition to Jacques, the movie gets more exciting. Rosanna Arquette plays one of her usual characters which I find she is good at and the most suitable actress for this movie tries to get in between Jacques and his underwater world with Dolphins. After several diving sessions Jacques also loses Enzo under the water who can not make it. The only person whom Jacques asks everything to teach him can not do that any more. Sometimes I come across and read  that they are doing the the Big Blue 2 ! With this end,  BB2 can only be a commercial movie nothing further ! This movie from laughter to tears, has more than you can imagine and it is too good to make a second movie. It is a collection DVD for me and I keep watching it almost once every year.
