This is absolutely the worst movie ever. Dont get me wrong you will watch this movie and say, "its not worse than any other bad movie i've seen in my life." Until you get to the scene where Busta Rhymes confronts Micheal Myers, that scene alone is enough to put this movie up there as worst ever. Before I describe this scene let me start off by saying that I hope that whoever came up with the concept for this scene was fired and blacklisted from doing anymore movies. I mean who the hell thought of pitting Micheal Myers angainst Busta Rhymes. Ok, the battle starts of with Busta Rhymes talking some smack to Mr. Myers and then it happens.... Busta Rhymes fly kicks Micheal Myers ( sucessfully).  Now alot of you might be thinking " ok it's over for Rhymes. He is dead." Well you would be very wrong because he delivers ANOTHER FLY KICK ( again successfully and this time complete with Bruce Lee sound effects). Micheal Myers goes flying out the window. Now I dont know about anyone else but if i was the director and someone said to me," Hey lets have Busta Rhymes fly kick Micheal Myers. TWICE!"  I WOULD SLAP THE (...) OUT OF THAT PERSON!!!!!!!!!!! THAT IS THE DUMBEST IDEA EVER, IT JUST DOESNT MAKE ANY DAMN SENSE. HOLLYWOOD IS GETTING RETARDED NOWADAYS!!! WHEN WILL THEY LEARN YOU DONT PUT BUSTA RHYMES IN A MOVIE!!!!!!!!!AND IF YOU DO!!!!! YOU MOST CERTAINLY DONT HAVE HIM ENGAGE MICHEAL MYERS IN A KUNG-FU BATTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In conclusion do not watch this movie.
