<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TTC54A">The Blues Brothers [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy] (Universal's 100th Anniversary)</a> is the exact same product as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AQO446">The Blues Brothers [Blu-ray</a>] inside a cardboard slipcase (that can be discarded) but also includes the DVD and a code for a digital copy and a sweepstakes entry.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TTC54A">The Blues Brothers [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy] (Universal's 100th Anniversary)</a> (which includes more) at the time of this review was selling for a few dollars less than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AQO446">The Blues Brothers [Blu-ray</a>].  Both of these products include both the Theatrical (2:13) and Extended (2:28) versions.

This is a perfect time to upgrade or pick this up if you never had the DVD.  This blu-ray plays fine in my PS3.
