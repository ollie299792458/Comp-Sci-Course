To the person that wrote that this was a masterpiece please take heed to what I say in this review I will address you at the end of my review.

Attention if you intend on buying this movie.

If you or anyone you know has a sleep deprivation problem please watch this flick. I will mail it to you for free and I guarantee that your problem will be over.

I agree with the reviewer that this movie boring and makes no sense. I will give you this much the best part of this movie is when he killed himself but the DumbA&& couldn't do it right. So what did he do he tried and failed to kill himself again. Had a chance with the girl he couldn't do it failed again. Dressing like a girl....WHY? He was and is a piece of garbage.

Please take heed to my review and do not do not do not do not buy this go and buy Motel Hell/Deranged combo thats a good old flick and Horror Hospital.

In closing to all of those who believe that this is a good movie you must be in a comatose state of life that doesnt require a pulse. It wasnt a mind thriller or a heart racer it was garbage from Hell. I have been to Paris a few times and it wasnt that sh*tty over there. This movie in word one SUCKS. Please dont buy this.
