I bought this DVD as a Christmas gift for my sister.  She enjoyed it.  I was most concerned with the quality of the transfer.  We bought a Charade DVD before from a local store and while the movie is excellent, the quality of the DVD was not.  The audio and the visual was not lined up well at all in certain spots.  So I bought this one in hopes of it being better.  And it was.  It's not quite perfect, however.  The audio and visual is not properly synchronized for a little while in the beginning, I believe when she is being questioned by the policeman in his office.  But soon after that and for the rest of the movie it is lined up as it should be.

I give this DVD three stars.  The movie itself is outstanding.  The only thing it lacks is the quality of the transfer.  If the audio and visual of this movie was lined up throughout the movie as it should be, this DVD would receive four stars easy.  I do believe I will continue to search for a higher quality of a DVD of this tremendous movie, Charade.  I hope that the next one I order will be perfect.
