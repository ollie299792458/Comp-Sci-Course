The Bone Collector.  What a great idea for a movie. Then cast Denzel Washington in the lead. PERFECT. This had all the makings of a great movie.  The acting was good, and the storyline was interesting. What happened??  The ending. When you invest the time, energy and money to create a movie that suckers in viewers, you should have a slam-bang finish.  This one failed miserably.  It broke the biggest rule of the Who-dun-it mysteries.  You NEVER make the villan someone that the reader, or in this case, movie-viewer could never in their wildest dreams have figured out. In the end, we have the villan - someone who amounted to, at best, a walk on role up to the point he was revealed. It leaves the viewer saying, "HUH?"  And the reason he wanted to kill our hero?  He wanted to make him suffer for some deed he had done prior -- which was never revealed or discussed in the movie to that point.  The laughable part was his rationale for wanting to kill him - he wanted him to suffer for what he had done to him.  Ok, so kill him - then what?  Its over. The Denzel character was a paraplegic, for Pete's sake. He suffered from seizures, etc.  How could death be more suffering than that?  I would have thought that the villan would have been MORE than satisfied to watch this daily suffering.  In the end it was lame, lame, lame.  Such a shame, too, when it had so much potential.
