This movie didn't do much for me, the DVD edition here has some cool features (which were considered with the review), however the movie is just there. In college one of my history professors told us about an "secret society" that existed with it's roots in the ivy leage schools that spaned to upper gorvenment. 
The actions of this secret society weren't posed as being negitve (although politcal coruption is likely with any organization) but more a controlling entity that helps focus key descisions.
I'll leave you to be the judge of the turth in this (and does it really matter anyway), The Skulls focuses around how such society can lock in it's members by treating them extreemly well and then expecting them to bond even though corupt illegal acts.
The story is drawn out at points, and leaves the viewer wondering how much footage was left on the cutting room floor to fit this feature down to a reasonable length. Somewhere along the way the movie just doesn't mesh, the soundtrack is laced with good music that tends to pop up at all the wrong moments more so for the sake of "being a good soundtrack" than complementing the film. Somewhere along the way the movie stops making sense and becomes unrealistic to the viewer, while the script is still trying to portray a realistic story.
The actors deliver in their roles. Especially Joshua Jackson (the lead character) who will hopefully use this mediocre movie to help launch his career.
