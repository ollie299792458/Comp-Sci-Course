I am an action fan and a Chow Yun Fat fan. There are two kinds of action movies, there are hardcore serious action movies like Hard Boiled or Die Hard, or there are comedy action movies like this or Rush Hour. I prefer the serious ones, but from time to time can handle the so called comedy ones as well. Chow Yun Fat is the man and any chance to see him with 2 barretas in his hands is reason to watch. With that being said this movie is so bad that it is unwatchable. I turned this movie off after about 30 minutes it was so bad. I rarely turn movies off, but watching this was an insult to my intelligence. Whatever writers and directers who  wasted the greatness of Chow Yun Fat should be forever banned from the movie industry. The acting was horrible, it was not funny at all. And at least if you are going to make a mindless action film, then put alot of action in it, this movie didnt even have alot of action. There was a decent ammount, but not enough to keep me interested. This is Chow Yun Fat's worst american movie, this movie makes Anna and the King look like the Killer. This is also the worst Chow Yun Fat movie ever, heck even the ..."Killers Two" or Hero's or whatever are better than this. Anyone that gives this movie more than one star will watch and like anything. They either have no idea what movies are suposse to be like or are just entertained by any garbage put in front of them. I dont even think there is any ammount of drugs that can make this film watchable. Stay away from it, and dear god dont spend any money to see it. If you want a action comedy with Chow Yun Fat, go rent Once A Thief. Do not watch or rent this, and Im not picky, I thought the Replacement Killers was great. You have been forwarned. What is the most disapointing for me is the fact that nowadays its rare to get Chow Yun Fat doing an action movie, he has been doing more serious stuff. So to waste this oppertunity is a disgrace to the movie industry and entire genre. Its truly sad.
