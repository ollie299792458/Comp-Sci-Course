Had the day after thanksgiving off and figured it's a perfect hang out and watch a movie day. I heard this just came out recently and it looked funny. Boy was I wrong. I was watching this with a friend and after 10 mins I said to him, "wow, this movie is pretty terrible so far huh?" He agreed. It unfortunately did not get any better.

If you explain the general plot, then hear about the actors in it, you assume this movie would be average at WORST. Jeremy Piven playing a used car salesman - this script should write itself. The problem is they try to hit you over the head with every single joke, and in all honesty, most of them aren't funny. There's a few that make you chuckle, but most are just thrown in out of nowhere. All of the sudden someone is yelling and swearing for no reason, and it just didn't make me laugh at all. This is coming from someone who likes stupid comedies. Anchorman is completely stupid, but it's hysterical and well written. This movie is so poorly executed, it's absolutely painful to watch. It makes "Step-Brothers" look like a golden globe winner. I wish I would have spent the hour and half cleaning my room.

I recommend saving your money and waiting for "The Hangover" to come out in a few weeks.
