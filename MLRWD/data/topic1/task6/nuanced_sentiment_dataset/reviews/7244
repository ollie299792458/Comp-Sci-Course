There must be something in the Geneva Convention about these kinds of movies.  Painful is a word that will come to mind time and again while watching this.  Running a mere 77 mins you will feel as if 777 mins have passed by the films end, yet you wont turn away, nor turn it off... it's a test (not unlike an experiment on MST3K - but for real), it's a rite of passage... it's something you can show to your friends and watch as they try to get their minds around cardboard sets (literally - these sets are hollowed out boxes with knobs and wires punched through... and the rocket is a cardboard 2-D model that is so obviously flat that no amount of forced perspective can help it), wooden acting (you could build a table from the wood laid out in this movie), and confused ideas about the Moon (don't go there), space travel, female "issues", giant spider(s) and walking rocks (Gumby's prehistoric ancestors).  But, it's not all bad... there are some real moments in this film.  Perhaps the best being the society the women on the Moon have founded, and the mental abilites they possess and use against each other and our "hero's" - it adds up to a missed oppurtunity to make a minor sci-fi gem over a second feature on a double bill.  For sci-fi library completests only... one last note, BOX ART - IMAGE has released these films with colorized images from the film, and I have to say they look fantastic.  Pity the films could not have been colorized the same way...
