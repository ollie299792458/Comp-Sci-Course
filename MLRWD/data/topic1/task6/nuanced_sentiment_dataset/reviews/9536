The people who created this film knew nothing about comic books.  It had no funny fan-boy references.  It was primarily just a snoozer of a spoof of the 1st (of the Toby Mcguire) Spider-Man films.

The dvd cover was misleading--For you thought that maybe the "heroes" pictured were gonna work together in a story.  But, they didn't.

Much of the humor was just blah, schoolyard garbage--mostly what you see today on tv in the likes of shows such as 2 Broke Girls (which is junk).

This was disappointing for me, for this flick was make by the same poeple who did the "Scarey Movie" films-Which I found were all funny and featured many elements from various horror flicks.  "Super Hero Movie" seemed to have like 5 second cameo-spoofs of other comic heroes.

This movie was obviously written by typical, lame Hollywood writers who don't have a clue about comics nor the films made of them.  I can count on one hand how many times I may have laughed during this 75 minutes of comedy-boredom.

Skip this and search for YOUTUBE comic book satires like "I'm a Marvel, I'm a DC"--Those less than 5 minutes spoofs will have you laughing 10 times more than you ever will watching the trainwreck of Hollywood "comedy" junk!
