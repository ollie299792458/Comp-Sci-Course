After having read some of the other reviews of this movie, I am almost ashamed to say how much I enjoy it.  Oh well!! 
It is many of the things the others complain about, a very typical Hollywood mid-summer special effects, over the top, action flick. However I do find it entertaining if you want an evening of fairly mindless enjoyment.
The special effects are good for their time, and still hold up fairly well.  The plot line (what there is) is predictable. The acting is mediocre thru ok.
Will Smith is just fine for me as a Marine Corps fighter pilot.  Some of his lines are a little much, but he and Jeff Goldblum work well off of each other.
Jeff Goldblum (whom I normally do not care for) is good as a typical science nerd, save the planet freak.  I for once actully enjoyed his part in a movie.
The Randy Quaid role could and should have been completely rewritten.  I understand what they were trying to do with him, however it is almost embarresing to watch some of his scenes. I hope he was paid lots of money for going thru this.
The likable Bill Pullman as President of the US....Hmmm I am still working on that. He gives the best he's got, and comes across as a decent choice for the role, but I really do feel that the role could have been cast more beleivably.
The most likable characters are the 'second tier' actors.  Judd Hirsch, and Robert Loggia stand out in my mind as really fullfilling their tasks in the movie.
If you buy this movie in the DVD format, choose to watch the version with the "cut" scenes in it.  It makes alot more sense and seems to flow better.
While I wouldnt put ID4 in my list of must see movies, it aint all that bad either.
