The Family Stone written and directed by Thomas Bezucha's is a great movie for the whole family. The Family Stone is a comedy mainly focusing on the ups and downs a family experiences when spending Christmas together. The movie begins when Everett (Dermot Mulroney)and his fianc&eacute; Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker)come home to spend Christmas with Everetts family. His parents Sybil (Diane Keaton) and Kelly (Craig T. Nelson) do not like Meredith. Their gay, deaf son Thad (Ty Giordano), son Ben (Luke Wilson) and daughters Amy (Rachel McAdams) and Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser) share the parents feelings that Meredith is way to uptight and serious. The family makes sure Meredith knows she is not welcome into their family. Meredith often finds herself in akward situations as she tries continuously to get the family to like and accept her. Finally she calls her sister Julie (Claire Danes)down to make things more bearable. Things get even more hetic and relationships start to break and also are created throughout all of the chaos. This movie is great for anyone who wants to sit back relax and enjoy a couple laughs. The movie is a great one to identify with if you have experienced family problems around the holiday seasons. I would say this overall movie is a solid and funny film. Watching Meredith drive herself insane to get accepted into the "Family Stone" makes for many laughs.
