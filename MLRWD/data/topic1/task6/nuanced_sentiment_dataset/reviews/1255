(this review contains some spoilers)

I went into the theater to see this movie with high expectations.  I'd just read several glowing reviews that all predicted, accurately, that the movie would be nominated for several academy awards, and I was excited to see another movie starring George Clooney, who has been one of my favorite actors since I first saw him on ER.  But after seeing it, I left disappointed.
This is not a bad movie, and I did enjoy it.  It just didn't feel like there was enough of a plot to make a feature film--I think it would have made a great episode of Law and Order or something.  To start off, the movie is anchored around cliches-- the main character is a burnout, his personal life has some problems, he works for a big corrupt company-- and then after all the fuss, he wins the fight by recording the bad guy's big speech where they admit to breaking all kinds of rules on a hidden tape recorder-- never seen that before.  And on top of that, for whatever reason, a big part of the end of the movie is actually shown in the beginning, which just takes away what little surprise the explosion had in its proper context.
Overall, my biggest complaint about the movie is that it is so overhyped.  Maybe it's just something I'm not getting, but I didn't think it was that great.
