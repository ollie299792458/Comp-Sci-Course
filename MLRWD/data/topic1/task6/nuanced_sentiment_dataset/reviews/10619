You see I'm not sure if it is the character himself or if it is the actor (Sebastian Stan) whom is making Chase so damn boring.  Could be both.  The dialogue was pretty trite for him and the delivery was bland.  Chase doesn't come off threatening, dangerous or even psychotic enough to be a serious bad guy.  Voldemort he is not and although this story is nowhere near as grand as the "Potter" franchise, there should at least be some parity between the main enemies.  Ya know like Optimus Prime & Megatron, Lion-O & Mumm-Ra, Batman & The Joker, Professor X & Magneto, etc. True, Chase had the power before Caleb and everything but in the end their power levels became equal but even before that happened, Caleb had more presence and Chase never really seemed his equal let alone his superior.  Maybe that has something to do with the actor (Steven Strait, he was real good as Warren Peace in "Sky High"). If they're going to do a sequel, they should make Chase more menacing to give Caleb a better nemesis to work with.
