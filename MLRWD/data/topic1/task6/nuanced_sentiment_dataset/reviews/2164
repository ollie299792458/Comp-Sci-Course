Well as my review title stated, this wasn't our favorite Barbie movie, and yes, we have them ALL!! The plot on this was a little bit thin, not that that matters for a movie aimed at 5 year olds, but a woman who wants to become, not the ruler of the world, but the only "singing muse"  So she resorts to evil and murder to do so. WHAT?? I had an especially good time explaining to my daughter the scene in which the barmaid pours water over one of the "player" princes heads... "why did she do that mommy?"  "well you see honey, its because he had sex with her then didn't call her back ever again...this is commonly referred to as a one night stand"  yeah right!
No but the music was just okay, silly storyline, and it gets really old how Barbie is just the pillar of morals in every movie... even when she is sharing screen time with her bff, she is still the one who does everything "perfectly"... figures out the riddle, gives her food to the starving woman, takes Melody on when Alexa wont go, risks her life to switch the mirrors at the beginning, etc.
All in all, my girls watch it, but its not the one they ask for.
