This is the one movie that covers this period of the Viet Nam war adequately.

First, you must get past the haircuts...minor.  Then you must get past the poor quality of the DVD.  It seems to be a direct transfer from the VHS version.  As a member of one of these advisory teams, I found this movie to provide the most accurate portrayal of the Advisor's frustrations.

The characters were people I knew.  The experienced WWII, Korean war Vet who also served as liaison with the British in Malayian insurrection, who lived to fight.  The old sergeant who was essentially a expatriate who never wanted to go back to the stateside peacetime army, The young guy who was good at what he did, and wanted to see what war was all about. The Captain who had to be there to get his ticket punched, afraid that it would all be over before he could get his Combat Infantryman's Badge.

The surprise at seeing a 2d lieutenant sent to a place where experience was needed more than "just a body".  , however, the "Idealistic West Pointer" was missing.

If you want to know what it was like...watch this movie.
