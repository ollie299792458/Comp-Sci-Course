THis is a beautifully crafted film! A fantastic and thrilling narrative that defies conventional categories. The writer/director tends to call it the movie a "sex-comedy", but that does an injustice to the wonderful element of tension and suspense this film carries with it. Ben Chaplin plays a dillignet but boerd bank employee living in the British countryside. Chaplin's character John sends away for a charming, well educated Russian Bride and ends up with a chain smoking woman that doesn't speak a word of English.
I honestly didn't realize how obscenely talented and dedicated Nicole Kidman is as an actor. The Screenwriting is also superb. Every element of the storyline fell beutifully into place at just the right moments. The movie has a great romantic storyline that doesn't make the mistake of trying too hard to actually be romantic. 
Aslo, I was rather impressed after finding out that the actors that played Alexi and Yuri were both Frenchmen -- they pulled of the Russian convincingly and effortlessly. IN fact all of the performances, including Nicole Kidman's come off stunningly, without the slightest stench of pretense or effort.
