Still a nice movie.  However, I agree with others who expressed finding the making of the Prentiss character a "super spade" in order to be worthy of a ditzy, White girl with no job, very telling about the perceived status of Blacks and Whites in America.  Also, the director must not have hung around any Black folks.  If he did, that whole "burnt out old man" speech wouldn't have been given by Prentiss' mom.  I don't know of too many Black mothers NOW who'd be overjoyed over their son bringing home a White girl.  In fact, I can see Mrs. Prentiss shaking her head while thinking, "ALL the educated Black women out there looking for a husband, and you bring home THIS!"  Also, the speech between the doctor and his dad seems to be beating around the bush.  Mind you, this movie was released during a time when Black men dealt with often DEADLY consequences of fraternizing, even slightly, with White women.  But the father does not refer to this at all.  I'm sure ANY Black father of the time would be fearing for his son's PHYSICAL safety over a union with a White woman.  Instead, Prentiss Sr. comes across as an ancient anachronism.
