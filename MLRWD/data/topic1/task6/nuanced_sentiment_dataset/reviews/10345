First of all the only reason this dvd got a 2 star review was for the matches on it. I can't believe the WWE seriously put this out. Hogan at 23 is just rediculous....Flair at 17? You gotta be kidding me....they left off so many great talents that should of been on there just to mention a few Dynamite Kid, Davey Boy Smith, Bam Bam Bigelow, Arn Anderson,Sting ( I know he never worked for the company but he deserves to be one of the top 50 of all time) Kevin Nash, Owen Hart, Scott Hall,Tully Blanchard.  I just can't believe their ranking systems...they need to take this off the market lol
I might dare to say the top ten should be something like this

1. Hulk Hogan
2. Steve Austin
3. Ric Flair
4. Bret Hart
5. Shawn Michaels
6. Randy Savage
7. Ricky Steamboat
8. Undertaker
9. Kurt Angle
10.Roddy Piper
now I'm not saying those were my favorite wrestlers but they all acomplished so much ....and I'm sure I'm forgetting someone lol
