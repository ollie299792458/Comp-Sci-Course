I have seen this film no less than 3 times (theater and DVD viewings) and still find it as refreshingly funny as ever! It stands up to repeated viewing as one of the funniest comedies ever made.

Steve Carell plays Andy, the 40 year old virgin, who is simultaneously geeky, awkward, sexy, funny and repressed. In one of the funniest scenes in the movie, he protests to his co--worker, David, that he has a very fulfilling life without love and sex. The scene then shifts to the reality: he frantically marching around his apartment practicing the tuba, then talking to his action figures as he paints them, and in the funniest bit of all---in his underwear and T-shirt with a karioke mike in hand singing Cameo's "Word Up" and moving to it in a stiff "white man can't dance" way. It is brilliant physical comedy!

Steve Carell could read the phone book, and I would watch, because I know he would do it in an original way that would be hysterical.

The supporting cast is excellent and well-cast. But Steve steals every scene he is in, not out of arrogance, but because he is so charismatic!

Two deleted scenes on the DVD are hysterical. The "You know how I know that you are gay?" scene between David and Cal, and the "omigod, I can't believe that they are saying that" (my words) scene between Cal and the lady store manager.

I love "The Office", and I hear that you are the greatest thing in the new movie "Over the Hedge", which I haven't seen yet. But Steve, please give us more film comedies such as this!
