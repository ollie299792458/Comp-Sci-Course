(the title is not a slam against conservatives; i consider myself to be one--not hardcore--but still)

When I first heard there was a new season of Futurama available to buy, I was ecstatic. Then I bought it, and the first episode was absolutely hilarious. Actually the first few were. But there are a few episodes on this season that just fly in the face of people with a conservative/religious opinion--kinda reminds me of Family Guy, and I hate Family Guy because it's always flying in the face of things that I personally believe (besides being written by retards and the fact that Seth McFarlane can't seem to get enough of his own voice). Anyway, I realize full-well that some people will differ in their opinions, but those particular episodes I alluded to made me feel "under attack" instead of just disagreed with. I don't like that. They go a little too far, in my opinion.

On the other hand, I was pleased to see the writers tone down the "humor" technique of having a character say one thing, then do the complete opposite for no reason. That has been a running gag of sorts during the entire series, and it stopped being funny after Season2. The Professor still does that in Season5, but not quite as often. They actually got some real humor going on this time, too. So, I guess try to take this with a grain of salt. Most of it is very funny, very implausible, and very illogical--all the things that have always made this series great!
