SPIRAL is an easy to follow, entertaining psychological thriller.  Joel David Moore is quite good playing Mason and he makes this awkward artist with obvious problems sympathetic and believable. Zachary Levi plays Berkeley, Mason's self-confident boss at a telemarketing office who inexplicably protects Mason both in the workplace and life.  And sweet faced Amber Tamblyn is Mason's "dream girl" conveniently also named Amber.  Two major elements in the premise of the story strain credibility.  Though we are told Berkely and Mason are lifelong friends and the script more than hints at Mason's tragic family past there is nothing we are shown in Berkely's ambitious selfish personality that really explains why he is such a loyal, protective friend to Mason.  The other unbelievable element concerns Mason's relationship with  Amber.  Though Amber is portrayed as a bit quirky herself she seems too attractive and articulate to be the initiator in a romantic relationship with troubled Mason.

Two twists are revealed in the last twenty minutes or so of the movie. One of the twists  surprised me and the other did not.  The storyline is coherent and the filmmakers are wise in leaving a few unanswered questions for the viewer to think about instead of over explaining everything.  The well realized setting of Portland, Oregon in early winter is a bit different and adds realism and interest to the film as does the original jazz music that makes up most of the soundtrack.  This film is no classic but it's not a bad way to spend an hour and a half either.
