I had heard nothing about this film when I rented it the other day.  In that respect I was pleasantly suprised.  This film really is not as bad as some of the other reviewers here say.  It does not have the gloss of high  budget movies like The Bone Collector, but I found that it made me think  and get involved in a way that the Denzel Washington movie never did. This  is not to say that it is a perfect film.  I thought the whole idea of  randomness(the killer deciding which way to go on the highway) was a good  idea, but they seem to shove it down your throat.  I also thought the scene  with Sheryl Crow spelling her name for the killer was a weak attempt to  immitate the Elizabeth Shue's classic scene from Leaving Las Vegas. What  interested me about the film above the minor blemishes listed above(I only  mentioned a couple of these) was how it is hard not to like the killer.  There are many scenes where I found myself hoping that he hadn't killed a  person because I wanted to like him.  I found this impulse much more  frightning than if the character had been a real menacing guy who was easy  to hate.  Especially powerful was the scene where he starts to beat up on  his girlfriend when she wants to make out and we realize that he doens't  know how to be intimate. Worth a view as a worthy attempt to put something  beyond the typical hollywood trash on the screen.
