Ok, let me say right from the start that compared to the original Jaws, Jaws 3-D is one of the worse movies ever. Jaws is a flat out classic and this movie...well, is not. BUT, this movie makes my top ten "so bad they are good" list. Maybe I just have fond memories of seeing this movie in the theatre when I was a little kid. I was so excited as I sat there with my 3-D glasses, but I was also terrified. Even then I could tell that this movie wasn't very good, but still, it is so ridiculous that it is fun. Besides the fact that it's in 3-D, the movie is about a shark that invades seaworld!! I mean, come on. Are you serious? I would have loved to have been at the meeting when they pitched that idea. and yes, the shark looks incredibly bad. but the scene where the shark breaks through the glass toward the end of the movie is one of the funniest scenes you will ever see. It looks awful and fake, but it is hilarious as is the expressions of terror on the actors faces.

So if you have never seen this movie, watch it if you have a sense of humor. and a few glasses of your favorite alcoholic beverage wouldn't hurt either.
