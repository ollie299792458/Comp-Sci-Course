This is an interesting film, important historically for several reasons, and a real 'Hollywood show'.
The letterboxed (not 16X9 enhanced)image is of really poor quality with defects mentioned in other reviews. If you absolutly must have it buy it....but otherwise take a pass.
Wait for a better, restored, and longer release (this one is not the longer 'roadshow' version, thus edited and shorter).
I can understand studios wanting to make a fast buck but films in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio should NOT be released on DVD unenhanced. There is just too little resolution alocated to the actual film ( unenhanced DVD's allocate resolution to the area of the 'black bars'....enhanced dvd's allocate ALL the resolution of the DVD to only the film itself).
I gave this DVD 2 stars but wanted to give less. I suppose having the film out in any widescreen form is better than not at all...but what makes this DVD so maddening is that an extrodinary restored Cinerama print exists in all it's high definition glory. Why do we get saddled with crap like this???
