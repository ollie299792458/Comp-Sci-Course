Honestly, I love this movie.  I do love it.  But the fact remains that this movie seems to be a cross of the book of Matthew with Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

When I viewed this movie with my class, no one could keep from laughing at the good timing, back slapping, smiley Jesus.  I liked it.  They thought the actor had been smoking too many left handed cigarettes.

But make no mistake, the movie does have its serious moments.  This provides a greater contrast in my opinion, having a wider range of emotions than in movies where it is dead serious and Shakespearian throughout.

Let me put it this way:  if you are a big fan of the Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston, or can't get enough of The Greatest Story, or your Jesus is more God than human, then this movie is not for you.  However, if you would like a different take than most, if your Jesus is equal parts man in the flesh and holy God, if you like and understand that there is "mess" in Messiah, then this is you ticket to ride.
