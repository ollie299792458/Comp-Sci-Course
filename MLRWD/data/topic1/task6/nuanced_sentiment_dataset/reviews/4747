Why does Hollywood insist on remaking movies with no attempt in making a better product? The original was made in 1965 with Jimmy Stewart, but the real star was the plane, the C-119 "The Flying Boxcar". In short this twin engined plane is torn apart after a crash in the desert and reassembled into a hand made plane that needs shot gun shells to start. In the remake, the pilot is also the owner of an oilrig in the middle of nowhere. He flies in, orders the well capped and everyone on the plane. Why would the owner of an oil drilling company be flying a plane over 60 years old in the first place? As stated, the oilrig is in the middle of nowhere. As his employees are getting on the plane, the Giovanni Ribisi character appears out of nowhere. Quaid, the owner asks, "Where'd he come from?" The answer is "It's a long story" and that's it. No back-story, little character development and questionable computer animation. As a side note, it is believed the last flying C-119 was used in this film. Without this make of airplane, the entire story line goes nowhere.  Even with this particular make of airplane..............
