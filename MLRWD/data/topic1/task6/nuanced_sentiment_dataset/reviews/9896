I really love this movie. It portrays a wonderful period in this nation's history. I know because I was an engineer on Apollo and worked on the Saturn V. I heard Jim Lovell say that Apollo 13 was just an engineering problem. His journey on Apollo 8 was much more important to him and his crew.  He was so disappointed that he never made it to the moon. Tom Hanks was the one so excited by this movie.

That is good because I think it brought home to the American people what a miracle Apollo was. This movie was well done and very accurate. Even ole Gene Krantz was accurately portrayed. If anyone really knew what happened, I don't know what they would think.

No one had heard of Sibrel until 2001. He has no education, is a convicted criminal and drives a  CAB!!  He lives in Nashville. He wants to trick you into buying a very poor video that he created in 2001 and wants gullible people to buy it for $40.00. As P.T. Barnum once said, "There is a sucker born every minute." If his claims of 10 years are true then why isn't he a multi-millionaire? National Geographic Society made a series of videos debunking all of Sibrel's claims. They are on YouTube. The last word: Please research everything I have written. There are thousands of books written by Apollo veterans. There were over 400,000 people that worked on Apollo. There are now MILLIONS. In the ensuing 40 years don't you think that there are many family members and descendants alive? My book has sold in 12+ countries and is in the Library of the Smithsonian as well as other libraries. I have Honors Degrees in Mathematics and Astronomy. P.S. He is a coward because he assaults women and senior citizens.  What a liar and con-artist!!
Oh, yeah, if you see any of my reviews with zero votes, it is jackass Sibrel voting "no" on my reviews. Amazon has caught him doing this 2 times. I wonder how long Amazon will tolerate this behavior?
Look out--you might be next.
