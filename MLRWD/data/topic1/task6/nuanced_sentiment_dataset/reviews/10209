This buddy cop duo of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan is among the best ever made.  I really enjoyed Rush Hour in particular, and Rush Hour 2 was good fun as well.  However, this time around, it seems as if the plot of the movie is completely pointless.
Whereas in the first two films the story provided good fodder for letting these two provide hilarious comedy and cool action stunts, now they're left to basically fend for themselves because even the plot itself isn't taken seriously.  The return of Soo-Yun (who grew up really quickly in just a few years, from being a little girl to being a teacher!) helps a little, but not enough.  This time, the comedic formula doesn't stick very often and the action scenes are also disappointing.
It's just too silly for its own good, that's my issue with it.  Even if the film completely recycled stuff that worked in the first two films, I would have been cool with that.  But this time, even the execution is off, to the point where the film isn't even that interesting.  For curious Rush Hour fans who haven't seen it yet, you may still want to rent it at the local video rental place if you have nothing better to do on a Monday night, but don't cancel dinner reservations to see it.
