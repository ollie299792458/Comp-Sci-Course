This is a film that needs a long evening, a strong pot of coffee, no make that espresso, some sharp tacks and a good friend to shove them into your foot from time to time.

The death of George Reeves is among the most mysterious deaths in a city filled with mystery and yet the maker of this film managed to make a movie completely lacking in anything of interest.

The storyline is difficult to follow, the flashbacks and quick cuts serve to keep the viewer from actually recognizing how bored they are and the protagonist/s are folks who would depress a collection of skid row drug addicts.

George Reeves may have been a bad actor with a lifestyle that created powerful enemies and personal choices that would have wrecked a stronger man but the viewer is given no clue as to why that might have been a part of his personality. The story seems to be about slipping off into the underworld of drink, depression and sexual depravity, which should have been titilating but in the case of Hollywoodland just becomes tedious.

Watch Taxi Driver and let your spirits soar.
