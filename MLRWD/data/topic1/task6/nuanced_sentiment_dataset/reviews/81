I've watched what many would consider the ten must-see samurai classics:

 - The Samurai Trilogy

 - Seven Samurai

 - Rashomon

 - Yohimbo

 - Zanjuro

 - The hidden fortress

 - Throne of blood

 - Sword of doom

 - Kagemusha

 - Ran

 They're all awesome!

 Both or either Toshiro Mifune and tatsuya Nakadai star in all of them, and 8 are directed by Akira Kurosawa.

 Now little did I know that "Harakiri was not only in the same league, but above them all.

 That is shocking considering that "Seven Samurai, Rashomon, & Ran" are included in the best 100 foreign films of all time.

 Why only a handful of people out there know about this film is beyond my comprehension. This is not only the best japanese movie I've seen, but in my opinion probably one of the best 30 movies ever, and I've watched most of the essential ones.

 If you don't like samurai or japanese movies because...

 A. You Have not learn to appreciate this art in its entirety or

 B. You are superficial minded and simply "don't care"

 in that case this movie won't change your mind, or who knows?

 If you dig true cinema, it does not get any better than this...
