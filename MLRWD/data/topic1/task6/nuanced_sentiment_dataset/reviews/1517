This movie was one I looked forward to watching so much I bought it without seeing it first after loving Groundhog Day so much. Big mistake, I laughed once through the entire movie, It wasn't all horrible, but that's only because of the two leading actors, Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss. There was no real funny content in the movie, I mean, it was a story line that seemed to flat line after the first 15 minutes. I don't expect a comedy movie to have an outrageously great storyline, but this was simply dragging on without any unpredictable humor. It's amazing how many people do enjoy this movie, but if you haven't seen it first, don't buy it, rent it.
You can do yourself a lot of good by checking into the finer works of Bill Murray like Groundhog Day, which is clever and unpredictable in many aspects. This movie is very predictable, and that makes it hard to find funny when you can see the jokes coming. It's more of an irritating comedy than anything where a doctor (Richard Dreyfuss) is the only one who sees Bob (Bill Murray) as a psychotic patient and everyone else loves him casting the doctor aside as a insensitive no-fun kind of "Dad". So it frustrates the viewer because the most idiotic predictable events are allowed to take place.
If you're interested in Murray, check into "The Man Who Knew Too Little", "Groundhog Day", "Ghostbusters", "Stripes", and "Caddyshack".
