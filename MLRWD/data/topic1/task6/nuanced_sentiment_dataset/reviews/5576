I mainly bought this limited edition blu-ray because I only had the full frame DVD version (I accidentally bought full frame at Wal-Mart.  I was distracted by the low price.  Damn you, Waltons!).  Anyway, I was very pleased with this purchase.

Not only can I now watch this fantastic film in full 1080p widescreen, but the special features are excellent too.  I learned a lot about the making of the film from the entertaining documentaries.

The clips from the Lebowski Fest documentary sold me on the cult status of the movie.  And the gimmicky U-Control "Mark It, Dude" feature, that counts the F-bombs and "dudes" and whatnot is completely unnecessary but amusing nonetheless.

I also enjoy the book that's built into the case, which has some great trivia for fans, some interviews, and even the recipe for a "Caucasian".  And the digital copy of the movie is nice for those who need to get their "Dude" fix on the go.

I recommend this blu-ray edition of The Big Lebowski to anyone who hasn't seen the movie, anyone who was a dumbass and bought the full screen DVD like me, super-fans who need every special feature, or movie geeks who are working on upgrading their collections from DVD to blu-ray.
