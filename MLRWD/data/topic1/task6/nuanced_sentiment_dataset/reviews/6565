National Lampoon's Animal House is a classic that had a significant effect on TV and movie comedies long after its introduction in 1978.  With just the right combination of satire, parodies and jokes on college life in the  early 60's, it's a perpetual favorite in our family.  I was fortunate to be  present during the movie's making in my home town of Eugene, Oregon in  November 1977, including witnessing D-Day's entrance on his motorcycle.  We  enjoy watching it for the content and for being able to recognize every  location in it.  (This movie was shown for some years at Eugene's Mayflower  Theater, directly across the street from the actual location of the 'Delta'  house.  The frat house's purpose in real life was a work-release center for  ex-convicts, ironically enough.) Bluto on the ladder, Pinto's 'good guy-bad  guy' mental debate on sex, Bluto stuffing an entire sandwich in his mouth  in the cafeteria, Otis Day and the Knights, and Donald Sutherland  introducing a few of his students to marijuana are unforgettable comedy  highlights among many in the film.  A bit corny at times, maybe, but the  movie is just plain fun.  It's a must-see for all ages.
