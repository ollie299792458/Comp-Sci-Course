I am a huge WW II buff, specifically the U.S.S. Enterprise.  I have read all the literature I can get my hands on, seen the shows and build models, so you can imagine my happiness when Battlefield 360 popped up.  I managed to get mine off of iTunes.

While a very well thought out show, it is very melodramatic.  If you know what actually happened during the war, the over-the-top narrator will sometimes make you cringe.  They also have a Marine 1SG on there, who really has no place at all.  He just talks about how tough he is and what it is like to be in combat, something I think the actual WWII vets are better able to describe.

While it is 98% historical accurate (with only some very small discrepancies), they often will gloss over American failures, such as the naval battles in and around Guadalcanal.  In this show, even terrible defeats are made to seem like victories!

The reason movies like Midway, Tora, Tora, Tora and Battle of Britain are so renowned, is they show both sides of the battle.  In 360, the Japanese are relegated to CGI snapshots of burning planes and ships afire.  A little more balance would have been nice.

All in all, if you aren't familiar with WWII, love the Enterprise or just like CGI-based history shows, this is a great buy and I am glad I watched it.  Nothing is perfect and I just thought I'd point out the flaws in an otherwise fantastic production.  5 stars!
