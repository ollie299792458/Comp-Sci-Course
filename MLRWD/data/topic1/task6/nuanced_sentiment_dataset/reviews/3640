I anticipate this review will not garner too many "helpful" votes (since a majority of people appear to have enjoyed this movie), but it is something I need to say anyway.

I am writing this review because I've read quite a few reviews (written by men and women alike) stating that men will hate this film whereas "women will love it." I am a woman and I absolutely hated this movie, the only reason being that it was absolutely boring, and, for lack of a better word, stupid. I can't tell you why it was so painfully boring, but I'm guessing it had something to do with the plot, which is yawn-inductive to begin with.

It is rare that I give out the one-star rating, but this is one of those movies it actually pained me to sit through. I watched it at a family member's house and I fell asleep 3 times. (Note that I am an insomniac and I do not fall asleep easily.) I can't help but resent it a little when people say that "women will love this movie" because it was quite honestly one of the most boring movies I, as a perfectly legitimate woman, have ever seen. To add insult to injury, the Ya-Yas are terribly annoying. A couple of reviewers have said that "to call this a 'chick flick' is insulting to all chicks," and I vehemently agree. I understand that some women probably will like it; my point is only that not all of us will enjoy this dull, insipid movie just because we're chicks.
