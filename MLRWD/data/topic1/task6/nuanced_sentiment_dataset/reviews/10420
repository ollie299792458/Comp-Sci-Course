Last Exile is a beautiful anime, blending CG and drawn anime seamlessly to create characters that stir you into feeling their successes and mourning their losses and a storyline that is moving and easy to follow. Looking at the quality of the trailers and clips, it seems that Pioneer has done this series justice in providing the dvd with clean visuals and a stunning dolby digital soundtrack. 
Last Exile is about Claus and Lavie, a boy and a girl who struggle to follow in their fathers' footsteps and be the best Vanship pilots in the world of Prester. By delivering a curious little girl called Alvis to the battleship Sylvana, they enter a world and a war where their skill and courage will be the key to not only their survival but of all.
You'll wish you were a part of this world in the sky...
Please disregard the editorial review that has been provided by Amazon. I could only imagine that someone who had fast forwarded through the first few episodes could possibly say the things that Charles Solomon wrote.
