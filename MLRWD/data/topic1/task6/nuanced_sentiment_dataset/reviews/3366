The River King is a rather peculiar movie. It starts off as a standard police murder mystery and ultimately reveals itself to be something far more complex- and that is when it fails.

The film's failure in its later parts could be in the miscasting of Ed Burns. It is not Mr. Burns' fault however. He is excellent at first as a heroic small town policeman bucking the system to prove a murder. Very few young leading men have the rugged masculinity and down to earth qualities he brings to a role.( He may yet become his generation's Steve McQueen)

However, when the film turns into a more complex pyschological study, Mr. Burn's performance suffers. He projects total confidence on screen, and that is the problem. He is just not believable as the tormented man that his character is slowly revealed to be as the film progresses.

In the beginning, I thought he was the perfect choice for the part, but at the end I believe an actor who could more successfully convey mental torment would have been better. (joaquim phoenix would have been ideal).

The river king is still an ok film despite this- it just could have been a great one if it had starred a more appropriate actor in the lead.
