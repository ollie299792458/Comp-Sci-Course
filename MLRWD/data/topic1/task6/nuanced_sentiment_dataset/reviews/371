A beautiful young woman suspects that her astronaut husband might have been radically altered by an in flight astronaut. His partner has a suicidal freak-out, and so does his partner's wife. She learns that she is pregnant and so the stakes increase. Ultimately, a desperate ex-CIA man struggles to spill the beans to her. Will he make it? Will she?

There is suspense in this suspense/sci-fi film; unfortunately, it is unintentional. It consists in wondering when the film is going to get suspenseful. We know everything from the get-go. We know what the husband's secret is, and we know the wife will eventually find out. The only possible pay-off is that the director makes what happens, when Theron's character finally figures it out, interesting. Unfortunately, she only finds out for sure about an hour and a half into a film well shy of two hours. How interesting could the remainder be? You do the math.

I absolutely adore watching Charlize Theron, both for her obvious charisma, as well as her genuine dramatic ability. How she got sucked into this piece of dreck might serve as a lesson for her. It is certainly a mystery to me why a woman who could snag roles in "Celebrity" and "Cider House Rules" would select this script. Perhaps she felt she could save it, since the entire focus is on her character. She did not. The script and the direction made it simply impossible. Even a true Theron fan, like myself, will be sorely let down ( even more so for Depp fans, of which I am not one.)
