I expected this movie to be interesting; the previews, as always, were somewhat deceiving.  It WAS interesting--a girl follows her dream, wins in the end...pretty typical, but cute.  Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg) is a believable protagonist with admirable spirit, but I found the movie to be sorely lacking when it came to the actual skating--the main theme of the movie.

I am not a skater, but I am certainly not naive enough about the art to believe that someone can go from an amateur to a professional in only a few months.  So it is with Michelle Trachtenberg's character, who begins skating lessons to enhance her physics project for a scholarship and ends up becoming a competitive skater.  It's just not realistic: any athlete, dancer, musician, writer, etc. can tell you that.  It takes years of practice to do what Casey Carlyle ends up doing at the end of this film.

However, this impossible accomplishment seems to be what gave the movie its glitter.  I mean, who wants a movie where the heroine practices for years and never ends up being spectacular?  It's just not what your average moviegoer is looking for.  I, on the other hand, like to err on the side of reality, but that's just me.

Overall, this movie was cute.  Michelle Trachtenberg is a good actress, and I hope to see more of her in the future.  Still, "Ice Princess" didn't truly stick the landing.
