Once and a while a film comes along that has it all - great story, fine acting, and the kind of directing that knows exactly how to stir my heartstrings without being maudlin. I'm also impressed that this is a true story, based on the best selling book by Laura Hillenbrand. 
The setting is depression-era America and the film includes all those little details that make that dark period of time come alive. The people needed a hero. And it came to them in the form of a racehorse with all the odds against him. Seabiscuit was too small and not well trained when Charles Howard, a self-made rich man recovering from a personal tragedy, took him on. Jeff Bridges is cast in this role and keeps his performance controlled and understated. Chris Cooper is outstanding in the role of Tom Smith, the trainer who takes care of horses that others would have discarded. "You don't throw away a whole life just 'cause he's banged up a little," is one of his key lines. And it resonates throughout the entire film. Tobey Maguire is wonderful as the jockey, Red Polard. He also fights all odds to get in the game and stay there. Each one of these men is damaged in his own way, just like Seabiscuit. But together they create a champion.
I loved the film and I also loved the extras on the DVD. I enjoyed seeing the writer and director describe their many challenges. I was fascinated as to how they created the close-ups during the exciting races. And I was particularly interested in the old newsreel footage. 
Don't miss this DVD. There's something in it for everyone. It's an inspiration for all and the feel-good feeling lasts a long time. Seabiscuit gets one of my highest recommendations. Don't miss it!
