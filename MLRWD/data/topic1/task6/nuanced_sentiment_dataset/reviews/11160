Although I was not around during his peak of popularity, I am a huge fan of Bing Crosby. The first album I ever personally bought was a cassette of Bing Crosby's Christmas songs, and my respect for Bing carries over into this wonderful classic as he showcases both his acting and his singing.

This is one of those wholesome films that captures your heart right from the start. The characters are easy to relate to and the musical score that accompanies this is excellent. There is nothing vulgar about the film at all, making it a top pick for family viewing (or for any type of viewing, for that matter--who needs the awful junk that makes up 95% of Hollywood's output today?)

The film brings feelings of nostalgia to me despite the fact I am significantly younger than the film. It makes me feel as if I am a few years younger and makes me remember the Christmases of years past, all of which have their own special memories. They are vintage wine--the oldest ones get even better with age--and the movie is the glass to hold that metaphorical wine. I just watched it for the first time last Christmas but plan to make it a tradition. However, I should note that the movie is good at any time of the year--after all, there are other holidays featured in this film!
