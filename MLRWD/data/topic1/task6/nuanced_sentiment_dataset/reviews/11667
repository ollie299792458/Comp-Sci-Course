As a harbinger to "North By Northwest", Alfred Hitchcock devised a  brilliant, crisp ending to "Saboteur" by setting up a confrontation between good and evil atop the Statue of Liberty. True to form, the director excels at these last-minute flights downward and "Saboteur" is no exception. It's a Hitchcock classic.

Nicely cast with an impressive young Robert Cummings as the lead, "Saboteur" is a terrific look into America in the early days of the Second World War. Wrongly accused of arson and murder, Barry Kane, (Cummings) begins a flight from "the authorities" which takes him (and an unsuspecting love interest) from California to New York. One of the side comic benefits of this film is the dated, cheesy language, which gives it an extra attraction. But Hitchcock had his own comic moments in mind that work just fine. Encountering a circus troupe at night during one of the legs of his flights, Cummings is introduced to a cadre of  performers, the funniest of which is the bearded lady with her beard done up in curlers for the night! Were it not for the midget and the platitudes that the film keeps offering, I would have said that "Saboteur" had its roots in "The Wizard of Oz", produced three years earlier.

As a suspense, "Saboteur" is not up there with later Hitchcock films, but it does give Cummings a stage for some fine acting, not to mention the often overlooked wonderful character actor Norman Lloyd, whose small but important role is central to the film. I highly recommend "Saboteur" for its fine cast and terse direction.
