Small Time Crooks begins with a funny enough premise:  buy a cookie shop in order to dig a hole through the basement to rob a bank; botch the bank job, strike it rich with the cookies.  The opening scenes are funny, the characters successfully sketched, and Allen's typical man-on-the-edge-paranoia, displayed in humorous neurotic style.  But, later in the movie, when the novelties of Allen and Ullman's character's wear off, when all of the jokes in the previews have been unearthed, the movie begins to dull down. It then becomes fairly unfunny, and the examination of their marriage as it falls apart isn't terribly interesting. I was pleased to see Allen returning to an older formula: his caper style films as opposed to the terrible, misogynist crap he's been doling out of late. Unfortunatly, this is one of those films that shows all of the goods in the previews, so much in fact, that if you've seen the previews, don't bother with the movie, unless you want the jokes you've already seen and heard spaced out.
