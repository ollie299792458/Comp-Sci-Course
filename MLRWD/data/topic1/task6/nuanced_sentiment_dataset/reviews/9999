I am a King fan and have enjoyed most of the King movie adaptations I've seen, but this movie is so dark and bleak from beginning to end.  I like horror best when it is suggested on screen, I don't like gore and this movie had more than enough of it to suit my tastes.  The creatures resembled the monsters in Cloverfield (another film with little redeeming value), and seemed a bit on the fake side to me.  The trapped towns people were so stupid and arrogant that there were a few I would have loved to feed to the monsters myself.  There were a lot of tired horror cliche's in this film, I don't think it had much new to offer.

What I disliked the most about the film was the disturbing twist ending.  At heart I want the good guys to win out in the end, and evil to be defeated.  It was obvious that King was going for shock value, but I would have perferred a happier outcome.  There was one bright spot in the end, but I won't reveal it since it would be a spoiler.  In plenty of other King films we have the satisfaction of seeing the good guy win, but not this one.  Since I've never read the original story I can't comment on whether the film was true to it or not, perhaps Mr.King isn't really to blame.

Stephen King Movies I have liked:  Rose Red, The Shinning TV Miniseries, Misery, Desperation, Sometimes They Come Back, Pet Cemetary, and It.
