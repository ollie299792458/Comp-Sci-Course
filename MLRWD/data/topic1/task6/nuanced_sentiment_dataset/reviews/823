In giving a star rating, I'm torn between rating the film itself and rating the video in its dubbed state. So lest anyone criticize me for "giving it one star just because of the dubbing"...
I am not a cinema expert by any means, but I have seen the subtitled version and I have seen the dubbed version, and the subtitled version is much funnier and more enjoyable. So you have to read a little, so what? I am curious why they chose to release the dubbed version on video and not the subtitled one. Probably thinking that, since it is such an immediate and enjoyable movie about movies, it might actually sell to English-speaking audiences as a "Player"-esque comedy, romp, etc. 
I can understand this, but can we please please see a release with subtitles?
I know a lot of information gets lost in the subtitling, so it's far from perfect either, but at least it's not actively disturbing, like when hackneyed American voices with little (or the wrong) feeling come out of mouths that are moving completely differently. Also, I like hearing the language be spoken. I like the sound of French voices in French movies. It's what the movie is supposed to sound like. Just as westerns sound right with American voices.
Maybe I'm weird, but I can barely watch the subtitled version. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend it (2 stars perhaps). But the movie itself is wonderful! Don't buy the video, but do go see it in the theater if you get the chance.
