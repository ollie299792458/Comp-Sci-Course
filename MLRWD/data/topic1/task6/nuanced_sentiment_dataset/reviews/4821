Now it's just my opinion, but whilst reading others reviews for Never Scared, I couldn't help but notice how everybody that gave lower ratings to this release spent a lot of time comparing it to his prior stand ups. I would just like to point out that if Chris Rock kept doing stand ups that were mirror images of Bring The Pain, and Bigger and Blacker, that his routine would quickly become redundant and old. I'll be the first to admit that I don't especially enjoy Never Scared as much as BTP and B&B, but by no means is it a disappointment. People can rant and rave all they want about how it's not "vintage" Chris Rock, and it's not as "in your face". Personally, I think he's still very 'in your face', and though the issues he elaborates on may have become more serious and political, it's still very much Chris Rock.

For the DVD itself, I consider it well above average. Chris Rock definitely hasn't lost his ability to point out the obvious while still managing to make people look stupid. He speaks of many current issues, such as the Michael Jackson case, Janet Jackson, Kobe Bryant, George Bush and the war in Iraq, and much more. And like his prior two specials, he ends it with a completely hilarious segment on relationships and women, that will surely make men laugh their behind off (and many women too) , and shake their head in agreement at the same time.

All in all, despite this being the weaker of his stand-ups, it's still an above average special, and still quite worthy of adding to your Chris Rock collection. 8.5/10.
