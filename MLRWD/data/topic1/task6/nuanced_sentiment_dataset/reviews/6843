I'll give this two stars because it was entertaining, but all of Covel's flaws are on full display here. Lots of both personal and survivorship bias. While I'll agree about dissing Jim Cramer (and Suze Orman for that matter), Covel is really no better and does the exact same thing.

In areas we agree on, it's serious DUH!!! time. You shouldn't buy a house you can't afford and the lottery isn't an investment. While it's a pity more people don't get this---it also ignores that over time, homes do appreciate and while the real estate bubble has burst, eventually all those homes will be worth more than what's owed (a house was always meant to be a LONG TERM investment). Also, if you buy your house with the idea of &lt;gasp> paying it off, eventually you live largely rent free.

Most of the buyers I'm meant to have sympathy for just looked really stupid to me. And I found it hilarious that all the real estate agents were suddenly so judgemental of mortgage brokers and flippers. These same realtors were the ones that sold single mothers homes with $1800 per month mortgage payments (seriously, my husband and I would feel pinched with that payment with two good incomes) and happily pocketed their commission checks.

As for gambling as an investment---I'll confess to buying a weekly Powerball quick pick (and I suppose I could put that $50 per year to better use), but I'm certainly not planning my retirement around it. That said, to put professional poker players in front of me and say "here's the way you can make money in gambling" is like putting any professional athlete up there and saying, "see???? that pick up game in the park could make you rich!". They're professionals, with finely honed skills I don't happen to posses.

In all, this is a very disingenuous film. Covel is largely a motivational speaker (today's snake oil salesman), offering his own get rich quick scheme---he's just prettied it up by dissing the very people he's no better than.
