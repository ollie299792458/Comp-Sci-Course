If nothing, this DVD is a proof that every modern editing technique is based on Soviet revolutionary silents, done almost 90 years ago.
Dziga Vertov - aka Deniz Kaufman - invented the whole new narrative form based on impulsive editing,rapid-fire cross-cutting, juhstapositioning simple shots to create methaphores and litotes and inject conotations into everyday`s images. Like many of the Soviet movies of the day, this film had an objective to prove that `revolutionary` cinema does not need clasic conventions, and maybe because of that it has fresh, independent, experimental breath and a lot of guts.
Vertov, at the age of 19, was promoted to became the chief editor for Soviet
agit-prop movies, position which he also used to experiment with form.
Dealing mostly with documentary footage, he managed to make it "alive", "exciting" and "agressive", spending months and months in his cutting room full of rats and dripping water. The results are two master-peaces which he made in 1920.tees:
"Kino -Eye" and "The Man With the Movie Camera" -  both milestones in the movie history.
So,if you like melodramas and romantic comedies this is not your ticket.
But, if you want to see the grandfather of Jean-Luc Godard, Lars von Trier and MTV cutting style, you should check it out.
