Ang Lee's "Taking Woodstock" is a gloss on both the epic 1969 event and the epic 1970 documentary, of interest primarily to nostalgists. Taking place on the periphery of the event, literally and figuratively,the film has a cipher where the main character/performer should be. Elliot Tiber, the real life individual, must be more interesting than Demetri Martin plays him, else why make a movie based on his experiences? Interest by association?
 At slightly more than 2 hours,this film could have been judiciously pruned or at least focused on more provocative supporting characters such as the festival hustler played slyly and seductively by Broadway and "Glee"'s Jonathan Groff and the most macho drag queen ever, incarnated by Broadway and Hollywood's uber actor Liev Schreiber. Imelda Staunton's thoroughly repulsive mother figure doesn't do the film any favors either.
The best that can be said for this film is that it continues Lee's sympathetic portrayals of gay characters ("Wedding Banquet", "Brokeback Mountain").
