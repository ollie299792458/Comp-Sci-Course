L.I.E. is a movie that will leave you breatheless, and speechless. The end has a twist that you would of never imagined, yet you want to see more.
Howie is a very smart young boy who is in the process of finding who and what he is. He gets involved with some kids that are nothing but neglected, problematic teenagers and as a result, he ends up getting in trouble.
Big John is an Ex-Marine spy who likes young boys and becomes almost instantly attracted to Howie whom had broken in his house with one of his "friends."
Howie is neglected by his father, who has a girlfriend who is good for nothing but sex. His mother died in a car accident so he is left at the merci of the world. Howie's dad gets arrested by the FBI towards the end of the movie, and big John takes care of him. To my surprise, he does not take advantage of Howie who was vulnerable at that point.
This movie is a must buy! It will teach you a lot about how we should appreciate life, and take care of those whom we love and cherish.
