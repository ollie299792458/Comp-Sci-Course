Watching it now, and it is rather lame, frankly.  Very obvious, very smarmy, very amateur.  It's not the worst ever, so it gets a 2.  But I would not watch it again, nor would I recommend it.

I don't like smoking, I'd be happy if it was banned as a nuisance to others.

That said, this movie is really, really full of itself.  And, sadly, it's more about hatred of the USA than it is about smoking evils.  It's just another typical Hollywood bait and switch, telling you it will be about one thing when it's really a socialist film using tabaco as the vehicle.  Maybe young Rietman has a skewed view of the world and the USA, growing up in the excesses of Hollywood, and is consumed with liberal guilt, convinced the USA is a bad, racist country (moreso than other countries, at least) and the cause of all the world's problems.  And I'm sure he thinks he's being smart and clever with this film (as did the author of the book).  But he's really just promoting the liberal agenda as usual with the same old line.  And one new line: home ownership is the root of all evil.  Who knew?
