Ever since I first heard of "Man on the Moon" I found Andy  Kaufman to be a rather odd choice for a bioepic.  But I was not suprised  that Jim Carrey was chosen as the lead.  He captures Kaufman in a way only  Carrey could.  Kaufman had so many different characteristics (most of which  can be seen in the film) and Carrey tackles them like they are nothing.  He  is quite a brilliant actor even when dealing with his more comic films but  to watch him in a more dramatic role such as this really helps people take  him seriously.  The movie itself is kind of weak.  It's not bad but I found  myself expecting more of a biography. What you get in "Man on the  Moon" is a timeline.  His "SNL" appearance,  "Taxi", Tony Clifton, wrestling, talk show antics, and more.  In  the end it basically looks like a bunch of Kaufman scetches being redone  with Carrey as if it were a Best of Andy Kaufman video with about a half  hour of biography in between.  I found the film to be very enjoyable in the  long run.  Carrey really shines in this film.  I had a good time watching  it I was just hoping for more of a biography and not just a rehash of old  bits. It is not a very good film but it is sure entertaining.
