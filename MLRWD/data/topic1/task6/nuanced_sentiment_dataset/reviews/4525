because I left out with a lot of question after I finished watching the TV series. For example, "Who is Rei?" "What is the H.I. project?" So watching this movie gave me a lot of clue. I agree with another reviewer about Shinji and Asuka. They become Adam and Eve of a new world. This can be confirmed by the picture of the package as well. The picture cynically represents the scene that taking place after the end of the scene in the movie. This movie still lack some qualities to be a great ending. Comparing with the happy ending of TV series, this ending is not really leaving us in a secure mood nor with satisfaction. The ending is dipressing and shocking. Furthermore, I was expected to see Eva unit 01's actions since the unit 01 had become very powerful in the episode 19. I didn't find any beast-like action after the episode 19 nor in the movie. However, overall this movie has more logical story continuity from the episode 24. And some details are shown implicitly in the movie. I found out a couple of stuffs after watching this several times. Definitely, this movie must be seen. I guess Director's Cut Episodes will be released soon make us understand about the plot a little better.
