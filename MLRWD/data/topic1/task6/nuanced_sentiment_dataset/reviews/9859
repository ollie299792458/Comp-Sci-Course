let's face it, this movie is a flop by de palma's standards, or by any other standards. The story is nothing special, a mix with ingredients taken from Carrie, Hitchcock in general, spy movies, dario argento (in the focus style, here and there), cop movies and stephen king. unfortunately, de palma didn't know how to mix these ingredients and we get a bit stomach-heavy when the film ends.

the best thing here is amy irving as the young psychic. she has a couple of really powerful scenes. the music isn't the "superb classic" some call it. it does its job. the movie is not scary, let alone "terrifying" or "mesmerizing"... these film critics... the plot is somewhat stupid, shallow and predictable. a secret agency needs a psychic. well, i think that's cool. but what for? there aren't any explanations in the movie. on the contrary, there are several pointless  excursions in the film, like the one when kirk douglas kidnaps the two cops, and then throws the car into a river. what for? when john cassavettes meets his fate, it seems a logical conclusion to a cardboard villain. no wonder cassavettes hated the film!

there are great moments, yes, but this is a disjointed mess. it's unbelievable how de palma directed the classics "carrie" before this, and "dressed to kill" afterwards.
