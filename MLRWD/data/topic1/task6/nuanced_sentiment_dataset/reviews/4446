This movie is incredibly fun. There's just something about it that I've always loved and it never fails to entertain, no matter how many times I watch it. Everyone in the cast is great, from Michael J. Fox to the creepy old lady. The story is wonderful, focusing on a hustler who can see earthbound spirits and uses his relationship with them to con people into thinking he's some sort of ghostbuster...until he gets caught up in a series of murders committed by one ghost disgusing itself as a grim reaper.

The film has just the right mix of creepy horror, quirky comedy and drama. If you are looking for gratuitous gore, this is not the film for you as there is very little blood. But for those of us who are more interested in the story and simply being entertained by a wacky cast of misfits on one hell of a ectoplasmic adventure, this is an amazing movie that is not to be missed and can be enjoyed again and again by a huge range of viewers, regardless of your usual tastes. Definitely one of my genre favorites; highly recommended!
