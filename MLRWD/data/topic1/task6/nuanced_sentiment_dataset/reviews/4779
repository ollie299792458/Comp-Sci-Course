The Friday the 13th series clearly has it's moments.  Part 1 back in 1980 was a horror classic.  A few sequels with horny teens geting stalked by Jason were well done as well such as part 4 and 6.  Jason X is just too unrealistic.  Don't get me wrong I could understand that all Jason fans would really like this movie, but thr FT13 series killed it with the sequels.  I know atleast this did not take place in the woods , but Jason in a spaceship is like an alien series movie, with a killer on the loose in a spaceship.  It had horny teens making love in a spaceship rather than a cabin or tent.  It is a bloody movie just like the others with a lack of suspense.  Kane Hodder does a solid job playing Jason but these FT13 movies are the same old thing all the time, we have seen Jason kill in the woods many times but this time he just does it in a spaceship.  All Jason fans will still be entertained, but this movie is well not the worst of the series but one of the worst in the series.  Beleive me Part 1 and 6 are the two best of the series, all true Jason fans should watch this as part of the series which was dieng slowly untill Freddy battled Jason, the series will contine to live with a Freddy Vs. Jason Sequel Written all over it, especially if Jason also battles Michael Myers In a three way.
