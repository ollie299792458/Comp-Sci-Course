WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD:

The first "Mission Impossible" movie was great, Part 2 wasn't but was at least fun and entertaining. But I'm sorry, this third installment is a waste of film, made for no other reason than to milk the franchise dry. Sloppy directing, terrible pacing, lazy acting, etc. Don't blink, because you might miss Keri Russell. She's in this movie for what, 10 minutes and then gets killed off? Why did she agree to do this? Quick and easy paycheck? Seems like the only logical answer. Philip Seymour Hoffman's talent is completely wasted, his character nothing more than a one-dimensional cardboard cutout villain. I've seen [...] movies with more character development.

One of the positive reviews here talks about the "excellent" final showdown between Cruise and Hoffman. Well I really must have missed something, because from what I saw, both punch and kick each other a few times, smash out of a window, and then Hoffman dies in the most hackeyed way possible by getting run over by a truck. I guess it doesn't take much to impress some folks.

The only positive thing I can say is that I'm glad I saw it for free with a voucher I got by buying the new Special Edition DVD of the first "MI" film. But if I had actually paid to see this mess I would give it a big fat ONE star.

Avoid.
