This review is for the "DIAMOND ENTERTAINMENT" DVD ONLY. In a few words: It's terrible. Yes, there are two films on a single disk -- but  they are very, very poor transfers of each film.
"First Spaceship on  Venus" (FSOV) -- I saw this one at the late Markham Theater in  Columbus, Ohio back in the early 60s. As a wide-eyed child, I saw it as an  impressive-looking, very widescreen production. And I ordered this thinking  it was widescreen. I was wrong.  On the Diamond DVD, FSOV is presented in  pan & scan format. The image quality is very, very poor at best. In  appearance, it's akin to a many-generations down the line miserable dub of  a pirated video. The colors appear to be -- for lack of better words --  washed out, bloated, contrasty. I just don't quite know how to convey how  bad this looks. The mono sound is echoey. No effort was expended in this  travesty of a transfer.
"Voyage to a Prehistoric Planet" (VPP)  --  I never saw this in a theater. I gather this is the AIP version of a  Russian film "Planeta Burg" or "Planet of Storms". Actually, this is a better film than FSOV. I'd like to see this one restored to its original glory. Unfortunately, like  Raymond Burr in the US release of the very first "Godzilla",  scenes with have been added to make it more agreeable to English-speaking  audiences. Basil Rathbone and Faith Domergue play very minor, virtually  throwaway parts. I don't know whether or not the original film was  widescreen but on the Diamond DVD it's presented "full screen".  The video image, while not as bad as FSOV, is still very poor. The sound is  mono.
No subtitles. Virtually non-existent extras.
If you're looking  for a high quality DVD of either film, look elsewhere. The "Image  Entertainment" release of FSOV has got to be better. At least they did  a decent job on "Destination Moon". 
I'm sending this  "Diamond Entertainment" DVD back where it came from. There's NO  excuse for this low quality on DVD.
