The photography of Sleepy Hollow is absolutely stunning. Emmanual Lubezki received a well-deserved Academy Award for it. Naturally, my expectations for this HD-DVD were quite high...

The source material seemed to be in good shape in every aspect, BUT:

The biggest issue I have with the picture quality is the heavy use of a digital noise reduction filter. This filter not only introduces terrible blocking artifacts but also kills image details - something you don't want to do with a hi-def format!

Apparently someone thought the film looks too grainy... Let me get this straight: IT IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK GRAINY due to the fast film stocks used in low light situations and the "bleach bypass" process used in the lab to achieve the gritty, desaturated high-contrast look.

Other HD-DVDs have shown that the VC-1 compression technology is perfectly  capable of preserving even high amounts of film grain (e.g. "Dune", "Casino") and therefore a very natural, film-like image. For a film with a running time of 105 minutes the use of any digital "grain reduction" is simply unnecessary and stupid.

As a result "Sleepy Hollow" looks very processed and artificial (in a digital kind of way) from start to finish.

After watching 10 HD-DVDs this is the first one I'm really disappointed with.

Picture Quality Rating: 2/5 (below average)
