"The Family Man" is about a man, Jack Cambell (played by Nicolas Cage), who receives a glimpse of how things could of been, if he had chosen a life with Kate Reynolds (played by Tea Leoni).

  The film is nothing short of astonishing. "Family Man" has it all, from comedy, to romance, to drama, you name it, "Family Man" has it. I was expecting a good performance by Nicolas Cage, and my expectations were exactly as how I had predicted it. But Tea Leoni, gives a performance of a life time! The chemistry between the two of them is VERY real, and therefore makes the film all the more realistic. There were plenty of smiles, and maybe for some, a tear jerker here and there, which plays with our emotions and gives us one of the best movies of all time.

  After recent misses, Cage makes the right decision to become the "Family Man". If no one knew of Tea Leoni to begin with, she will become a house hold name by the time you see her Oscar winning performance. As for the ending, it wasn't quite to my liking, but if you look at it, given the circumstances, it was a realistic ending, and not the Hollywood ending we were looking for. And Bret Ratner really pulls of a magnificent job as the director of such a serious film, rather than his previous work (Rush Hour, Money Talks). A film I now have in my DVD collection, this is a movie I won't let anyone borrow any time soon.
