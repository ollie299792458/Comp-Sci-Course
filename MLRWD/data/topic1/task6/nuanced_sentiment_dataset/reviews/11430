The best I can say for this rockumentary is that, well, at least there's something about Gram Parsons out there now. . .  However, the sense of proportion in this film is so skewed Parsons comes across as a glamourous rock-and-roll loser rather than the unlikely influence he became after his premature death.  More time, for instance, is dedicated to his outlandish psychodelic suits than to his ground breaking albums GP and The Grievous Angel, and no time at all is set aside for discussion and interviews that help explain why Parsons's work ultimately influenced so many musicians so deeply.  Though Keith Richards, Emmylou Harris, and several Byrds members offer fascinating insights in Parsons's life, the family interviews (and the unfolding of the rather complex Parsons family history) is confusing if not confused.  There are woefully few interview snippets with Parsons, himself, though I'm certain interviews with him exist because I have heard them.  Sadly, in the end, rather than illuminating Parsons' flash of genius in the early 1970s, the film unintentionally portrays him as a Rolling Stones hanger-on and a want-to-be rock star rather than the underrated visionary he became--the man who helped reinvent country music and establish its relationship to rock music.  Fallen Angel, therefore, is an interesting but failed film, a missed opportunity that might have helped give Gram Parsons his proper due and help place him a bit more securely in the American music pantheon.
