I like  horror films just like the other guys  on this page.Maybe this is the reason why I liked this film...Before my opinons about it, I must say that I really hate 'Scream 3'.It was a big fiasco...If you are a real spectator of horror films you may like it. Because it bounces you at almost every stages. Moreover, I think there is an important point that is shown us at the end of the movie.Paige (Denise)is not sure about her love during the film till she saw her friend Dorothy with the mask on her face.And then, Adam (David) got the cute girl...Actually there are some other points we should think  on them...Adam is not the only guilty guy I think.People around him are so coarse to him at the early stage of his life..Of coure, this would not be an excuse but we can see that usually there are some reasons which push the guilt person into a murder...What I am triying to say I got a considerable pleasure during the film both for its horrific scenes and thought-provoking content.If you are able to get the messages you may really enjoy this one. It can not get the oscar with its plot but it is enough to make the mood tension...And I would like to congratulate Denise and David on them well performance...
