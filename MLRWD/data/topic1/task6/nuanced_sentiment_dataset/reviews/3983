This movie demonstrated some very complex dynamics involving a Father Son (Rebellious Teenager) relationship. George (played by Kevin Kline) needed to reconcile the inherited errors of his father by resolving his estranged relationship with his Son. Sam (played by Hayden Christensen) did an excellent job portraying a confused adolescent in dire need of some dedicated parental attention. Sam's apprehension to accept any parental love was frankly a well defined page out of both teenager and parent's diary. The relationship between the confused teenager and the flawed parents presents realistic complexities. The story line in of itself was good. The additional entertainment of some obscure relationships acting as a theatrical counterpoint to the main line of the story was quite weak and a waste of film time in this reviewers opinion. Unfortunately it is understandable that the director may deem these scenes necessary to maintain the commercial film standard.
I would suggest that it is worth seeing as well as enables the audience an opportunity to grab some more popcorn when those inconsequential fillins pop up with out missing much.
