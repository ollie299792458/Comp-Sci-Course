I promised myself that I'd never get hooked on another television show again after Twin Peaks was cancelled years ago.  I kept that promise for a long time.  But when I saw the first season of Supernatural, I was hooked again- only more so-  this time by a higher quality and more interesting show.  With the original characters, writing, storyline, dialogue - not to mention the great acting, every season got better setting even higher standards and higher expectations than the last.  Season 5 was no exception and included the best season finale yet. The entire series goes way beyond any horror show ever made.  It has immense depth in all its aspects. Although in season 5, there was definitely less humor- but what can you expect after Armageddon starts. Although, I did miss some of the humorous bantering between the characters that was more prevalent in past seasons. This season also had some awesome episodes to lighting up the mood when needed.  I have never purchased the DVDs to a series until now- and am looking forward to adding season 5 to the last four.  My great concern is that season 6 will be the last- what can be topped by what season 6 has in store for all of us fans.
