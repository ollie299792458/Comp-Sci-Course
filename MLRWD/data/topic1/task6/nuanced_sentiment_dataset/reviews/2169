OK, before I start, let me just say that I thoroughly enjoyed Evangelion. I fell in love with its mech action and dramatic character development.
But I have to draw the line somewhere.
This DVD was a waste of time. It simply consisted of a lame recap of the original series with the first half of EoE tacked on the end. In other words, it serves no purpose. If you have the complete series and EoE (the "real" ending), then you might as well set flame to $30 if you plan on purchasing this little farce.
And that's why I disliked D&amp;R so much; I loved the Eva series. In fact, I even liked the original ending! But this DVD was a huge dissapointment. It's an obvious insult to the fans... just more filler for the sake of profit.
However, it does have a few redeeming features. If you're one of those anime elitist types that wants to know a little about Eva without buying the entire series, you will enjoy the story summation at the beginning of D&amp;R. Also, to spite all of my gripes with the "movie," it's a must-have for all you Eva fanboys out there.
But if you're just a casual anime-watcher, steer clear of D&amp;R.
