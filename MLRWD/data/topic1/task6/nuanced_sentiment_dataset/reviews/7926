If this film did not have explicit sex, I suspect it would have gathered almost no attention. It was truly awful--boring, painfully pretentious, and absolutely ridiculous.  It was almost a parody of an existential French art  film--but not at all funny. The only reason I didn't turn it off after the  first few minutes was because I kept thinking this must get better--but it  didn't. Not only was Marie a totally unlikeable character-as was just about  everyone else in the film-but she was completely boring as well. The movie  would had nothing at all to talk about if she had just done the obvious  thing she needed to do--dump the loser boyfriend and get some therapy!  I  mean really--if your partner asks if you like his body, you say yes, and he  says--with obvious contempt--"you're disgusting" as her boyfriend  did--wouldn't you leave? And do you want to watch a whole movie about  someone who doesn't even flinch at this, let alone leave? Frankly, I was  surprised that a woman was responsible for such a mysogynistic view of a  woman's sexuality. Nothing interesting here--don't waste your time.
