I knew that this film was going to be challenging when I read about it, but I thought that I was up for it.  malin Ackerman seems to know what she is doing, and with Willis and Whittaker on board, I thought I'd give it a try.  I'm not sure why Bruce Willis would have signed on for this (much less why he is on the cover--his role is quite limited), much less Forrest Whittaker.  I guess the script must have looked like it had some promise.  Ultimately, this film is very dark, takes a while to get going, and then substitutes painful amounts of violence and some "edgy" time cutting for an actual plot.  Unfortunately, the "cut back and forth" thing has been done a lot, and doing it originally or in your own voice is harder and harder to do.  Here, it seems to echo a lot of the action films told in similar ways.  Some folks have referenced Tarantino, and I think that that is a pretty good reference.  Tarantino's insistence on comic book violence also comes through here.  Anyway, on the bright side, Ackerman is actually effective as an action heroine, and I just wish she had more to work with.  I'll recap the plot, but it is kind of beside the point--Ackerman and co need to wrangle a truck away from its driver at an out of the way diner.  The truck is supposed to be filled with goodies (drugs/money).  A simple plan, but we all know that simple plans never go according to plan.  Forrest Whittaker plays a sheriff (sort of, don't want to give away the thin plot) and...well, hilarity ensues.  Ok, not hilarity.  Shooting. In the end, there are a lot of twists to keep your interest, except they don't really.  Catch this one on netflix or at a friends house while having a beer.  It'll be better with friends and beer.  It has to be.
