Cloverfield is one of those movies that everyone seems split about. Half the people who watch it hate, the other half love it. And I suppose there a little percentage in the middle who are neutral.
I, personally, thought it was genius. It's been a very long time since I saw a monster movie that not only kept me interested, but made me research it when I got home from the theatre.
If you're interested, the sheer amount of supplimental content on the internet is astounding. Numerous blogs created by characters, websites from evil corporations, and the group trying to take them down.
Featureswise, this DVD isn't anything amazing. It has a few hidden easter eggs, but not much to really clear up any mystery. If anything, it made me question a little bit more.
This film is not, in any way, for people who get motion sickness. It's done in a handheld, 'shakycam' style, making it seem more real.
If you can handle all the movement and whatnot, and like a good monster movie, I highly recommend this to you.
