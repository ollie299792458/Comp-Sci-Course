The 3rd film has better special effects than the second film and better hunting weapons.The 3rd film only offers you better special effects and better weapons.

Ryan Reynolds "Hannibal King" adds the comedy that everyone might keep hearing about.He makes smart #ss comments that are funny , that's it.

Jessica Biel "Abagail Whistler or Whistler" is smoking hott in this movie too.She's also a martial artist and can whoop any regular vampires butt.

Parker Posey "Main female Vampire" , this woman is smoking hott too , she puts in a decent performance , most of her work was believable , but she knew no "martial arts".

Dominic Purcell aka "Dracula aka Drake" does a solid job.He's not a bad actor at all.In the movie he's not a martial artist either , but he's a pro at the sword , better than Blade.But no Vampire is immortal.

Triple H , did a grade A job.He didn't mess the movie up at all.He's just a big goon and that's his role all day.Triple H punctured Ryan Reynolds left eye on accident while performing a stunt.All it was , is a kick to the face that so happened to be real.You can catch it in the movie and the bonus materials.

3 1/2 stars for Blade III.If you own the first 2 Blade films like me , then buy the 3rd one too.I will.

P.S. also on a website by yahoo , it states the Daystalkers "Reynolds and Biel" , were gonna make their own movie since they had I "think" there own comicbook.Who later become Werewolf hunters.
