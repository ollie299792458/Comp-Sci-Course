I agree that the acting is pretty bad. I also agree that there is something compelling about in this little low budget film. Its a little gory but the killing never seems real, so it is kind of funny. My biggest complaint is the the best character in the film is Frankenhooker (the girl frankenstein). My feeling is that she should have been the focus of the film, not her boyfriend (the scientist type guy). The few scenes where she goes on her adventures through the streets should have been the body of the film. Frankenhooker is still pretty despite being just put together. And she is kind of funny making faces and walking through town and greeting people on the streets(although this was over done a little). I think there should have been more time seeing how people react to her. More adventures. More Johns that she tries to get involved with. The film drags at several points when she is not in the picture. Its worth a look if you like camp. You may be able find a used copy and one of those sites (like at half,com) if no new copies are available.
