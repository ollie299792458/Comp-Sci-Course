I don't understand this current trend of remaking old films. It is one thing to update an old Shakespeare play to modern times, but to remake a classic movie, seems sacrilege. I'm  sure its worked at times, as I enjoyed the U.S remake of the Ring. It wasn't the best movie ever made but it added cultural relevance to the original movie. Since the original was made in Japan it related more to their culture and I feel they did a good job at interpreting it to be made in the U.S. The remakes of Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and (soon) Dawn of the Dead get it all wrong however. Usually there is a commercial intent involved, with throws a wrench in the already existing vision of the original film. They seem to select actors who do not match up to the original casting, like in this case Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates. Someone like Crispin Glover (not that he would accept such a travesty) would have been a better choice. The "modern" touches to these films that are added seem even more dated than any timely references in the original films. These remakes have no soul, and are essentially worthless.
