Saw both the original NATM and this sequel and have to agree with other reviewers that this one is actually better. The inclusion of Amy Adams in the cast adds a real spark, but all of the cast members are just great. There are obviously a lot of historical references in the movie which provide openings to discuss the real characters and events with your children so there's some educational value as well. It's also terrific to see all of the displays in the Smithsonian in such an animated setting, especially Air and Space which looks even better than I remember it. Having said all that, the best things about the movie are the clever dialogue and characterizations (including Hank Azaria as a reincarnated Egyptian pharoah who channels Boris Karloff). There's an unforgettable encounter between the Ben Stiller character and an overeager security guard at the Smithsonian that is absolutely hilarious, but that's just one of many such scenes in the movie. Lots of belly laughs from beginning to end. The ending is satisfying and hopeful. Just about as close to perfect as you could get.
