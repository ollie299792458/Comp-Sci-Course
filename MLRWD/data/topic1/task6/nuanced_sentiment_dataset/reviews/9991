I'd have given this movie 3 stars if it weren't for the brilliant performances of its cast. Despite an unforgettable portrayal from Gwyneth Paltrow of a haunted, tormented soul in a performance that is almost disturbing, the film glossed over Sylvia Plath's relationship to her art while focusing mainly on her relationship to her husband, poet Ted Hughes.

The movie version showed collaboration between the two poets only during their courtship phase, with Sylvia losing touch with her art shortly after her marriage. However, biographies of Sylvia stress how, for several years during her marriage, and before its collapse, there had been a period of productivity and fruitful collaboration between her and her poet husband, where they both helped, encouraged and inspired one another. The relationship the-movie-Sylvia had with her poetry seemed marginal, and after her marriage, nearly non-existent.

Was it that the film-makers, with eyes on the box-office, feared to "alienate" their average customers with any emphasis on poetry, so they decided to flatten out the story, believing that focusing on her mental disturbance and putting "that bit about art" on the backburner would sell better? Or was it simply that Hollywood is completely out of its depth whenever there is any depth to be dealt with?

So, the-movie-Sylvia was this deeply disturbed woman, jealous of nearly everything her husband did, and her own relationship with poetry and her work was skimmed over and presented in a most superficial manner. Daniel Craig's performance was sophisticated, leaning more towards the portrait of an estranged husband rather than a womanizing scoundrel. Other supporting cast were excellent.

If viewers didn't know much about Sylvia Plath, the impression they would get from this movie would be that she was a mentally disturbed soul, but not a serious artist. A sad distortion, with the performance of its cast as its only saving grace.
