If you loved the "Dollars" Triolgy then you'll definately be let down. HANG EM HIGH is the American version of a spaghetti western and does not come anywhere close to the genius of Sergio Leone. The music is [inferior] and the scenery shots are of stock quality. The filmmaker even tries the famous Leone close up technique but it's lost in bad acting.
HANG EM tries hard to be a good film. It has a good plot (Clint seeks revenge for a mistaken hanging) but the characters are weak and underdeveloped, and the sub-plots are not followed up (Rachel's revenge, senseless hangings and the question of justice, the 2 remaining lynch party members). The film ends aburptly and has the feel of a late 1960's TV show.
Other than a few good scenes (Clint carring the cattle comes to mind) the film was quite boring with no surprise action and twists. It plays out just as you would expect it. Do yourself a favor and see FOR A FEW DOLARS MORE, A FISTFULL OF DOLLARS and THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY instead.
