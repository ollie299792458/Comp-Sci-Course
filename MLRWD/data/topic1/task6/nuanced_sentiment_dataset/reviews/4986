I recently found this book in a vacations resort and I read it on a few days... The story was very simple and beautiful, and make you think about the basic and really important things of life. My thoughts were how to spread the simple message of the book, especially to my teenage sons and daughters.
So, I searched for the movie and found this version which I quickly bought from Amazon, as it was not available in any kind of local rental or legal download site.
Well, I must say that as most of times, the movie was not at the level of the book. Even though it is a nice movie and the story is well adapted (with some variations form the book, specially all the ending), it's not able to provoke the emotions of the book and make you think a little about life...
At the end, the comments of my kids were "nice movie"... and they left to continue with their issues...
If you enjoyed the first half of the movie "Children in Stripes Pajama" you probably must see this movie, especially because of the happy ending that will leave you more optimistic than in that other movie.
In summary, It worth to be seen as family, as it can motivate conversations with older kids, but it won't change your life...
