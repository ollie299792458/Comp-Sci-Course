If the Chavez-Castro Anti-American axis would have produced a documentary on Latin America, it would have looked like this Oliver Stone documentary. Stone documents a recent trend toward anti-American dictatorships in South America, all modeled after the Castro-Chavez models. Modern dictators need an Evil Empire and they have found it in the greatest democracy of the world- the US. Oliver Stone sets out on a road trip across five countries to explore political movements of South America while interviewing seven of its anti-American leaders. In casual conversations with various strongmen, amongst them Hugo Chavez (Venezuela) and Raul Castro (Cuba). Stone gains access to all these anti-American dictators and performs a hatchet job on the world free press that criticizes abuses of power in some of these countries (e.g Cuba and Venezuela). True reforms to help the peoples in these countries will only come with limited powers of their government and greater political and economic freedoms. I understand Stone's dislike of George W. Bush, perhaps the least liked Republican President since Hoover, a bias that unfortunately tinted the objectivity in the production of this documentary.
