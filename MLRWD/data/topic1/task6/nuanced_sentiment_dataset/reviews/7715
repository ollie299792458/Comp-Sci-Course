I just wanted to say that this is a super film. And I was impressed that Spike Lee was the producer of the film. No, dont get me wrong I love and have numerous films(original) produce by four mules and an acre productions, it just that this film was truly great love film which he dont produce many of. I have seen this film numerous times with my family. We watch this film every night. Omar Epps, who I have enjoyed watching since, Juice was outstanding. I have always followed his career and was disappointed when ER took him off the show. And Omar if you are reading this message I want to say, now I know that it was a blessing from above that you was not on the show any longer God have bigger and better plans for you. I also want to add that  Sanaa Lathan was  outstanding. I truly love this movie where true love conquers all. And how you have just one powerful love in your life. I can see great things for her and I can't wait to see Disappearing Act.
One more thing that I have to note I have talk to numerous people and they say that this is an outstanding movie. No I am not just talking about women many mens have seen this movie five or six times and love this movie. So tell me why this movie is not on the top ten list of movies.  
Gina keep up the good work...cant wait to see your next movie..
