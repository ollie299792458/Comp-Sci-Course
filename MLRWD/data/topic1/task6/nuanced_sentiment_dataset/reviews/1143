I find it very hard to believe that this is the version of the film Walter Hill intended.  It sounds more to me like he had this idea of the comic strip shots in his head a couple of times when he was making it, and then discarded it, knowing it wouldn't work.  But when the idea of a Director's Cut DVD came up 25 years later, he probably decided to say, "Yes, this was the version I was thinking after all."

When the Warriors first was released in 1979, it was electrifying.  It was a dark gangster film, taking place all night, with a glitzy look.  Underneath this gang movie was a simple, fun comic strip.  What made it so entertaining for me was watching the gangster story on the surface and seeing the comic strip aspect underneath.  Like Star Wars (which was a space adventure on the surface but a western like adventure underneath), the Warriors entertained us with it's combined genres.  Seeing a movie about gangs, with the electric like score, colorful costumes, and well staged action sequences brought out the excitement in us.

This film doesn't need these unnecessary comic strip drawings that have been inserted in the Director's Cut.  These changes make it too obvious it's a comic film.  The gangs are no longer menacing.  The story no longer has suspense.  Maybe I'm being bious because I'm so used to the original version but I just don't see where Walter Hill thinks these additions help.

The other features are entertaining.  I liked the documentary of the making of the films to an extent.  I would have preferred more interviews with some of the other actors though.  When they talked about what a great performance Roger Hill gave as Cyrus, I was waiting to see him interviewed.  Why not some clips to show where these guys are now, like on the Warriors movie website?

Overall, I would say this DVD is not up to par with other Special Editions.
