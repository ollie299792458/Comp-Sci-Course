There is a part in the documentary where the inevitable question is asked: who was the greater icon - Piper or Hogan. Now everyone knows that there has always been (and always will remain) the endless debate- who was greater, who put the butts in the seats at Wrestlemania, who was groundbreaking, and ofcourse the inevitable who is the better wrestler. Let me answer that one for you here: Roddy Piper was the ICON the INNOVATOR and the origional BADMAN of wrestling. Hogan didnot come within an inch of Pipers talent and abilities.
In those days Wrestling was divided between two fractions. There was the upstart WWE and then there was the rest. Other than WWE, wrestling was dominated by NWA and Ric Flair. To me Piper was to WWE what Flair was to NWA.
Piper had the charisma, the talent to talk, the talent to rouse interest in his matches and an uncanny talent to make everything personal.
He never won a world title and he damn well didnot have to. He was uninhibited, incorrigable, politically incorrect, and COOL. He said things and did stuff that would send lesser men to jail, or to the unemployment line, or at the least, get beaten up. He was the primary reason why Wrestlemania was a success and it has always been a success ever since.
Above all of his talents, of wrestling and in-ring story telling, he had a gift that is probably dead in todays wrestling; he could rouse the crowd in believing that it indeed was personal between him and his opponent. He made the spectators believe that it was indeed a fight in the ring, that it was not scripted.
Great DVD that shoes his WWE and later wrestling evdevours but not his earlier works with Flair. That will be my only dissent of this set.
