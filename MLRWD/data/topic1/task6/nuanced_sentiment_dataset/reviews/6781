First let me say that this is one of the best martial arts movie Ive seen. However, the dubbing made this movie really really bad.  Ive seen the Chinese version DVD and the American one. Almost half the original dialogue has been changed.  Most of the time, it's not even what the characters said in the chinese version.  It's like they made a bunch of white people sit in a room to watch the chinese version, and afterwards, they let them make up the english dialogue whatever way they want. Another reviewer said a lot of the deep martial art meaning has been lost and that is so true. Sometimes, they even get the chinese writing wrong.. For those who have seen the movie, the one sign that they said was 'acceptance' is actually 'tolerance'. The sign that the general held and said was 'jin wu school is closed down' actually  meant 'sick men of china'.  it's little things like that they annoys me. Of course, if you don't care what the director originally wanted you to see, this wouldn't be a problem. Dubbing killed this movie..
