This film, if I can even call it a film, is so... completely stupid. I planned on buying it, just for the 3D and just to add it to the collection. As if you couldn't already tell from the title that this would be stupid. But, I felt why not give it try and paying $5 thanks to Walmart for miss marking it, seemed like I had nothing to really lose.
They tried to be funny, wasn't funny. They tried to make it scary, it wasn't. The saddest part is you would think from the title that there would naked girls running all over the place. To be honest there were, but there was more in the first than this. And this is coming from a gay man, a movie with DD in the title you would expect something more... DD.
The acting, was worst than anything I have ever seen. I would have turned off the movie during that part when the cop from the first was fighting with that ugly guy that was driving the party boat from the first. Then... "Bring me my legs"... he has shotguns for legs, that seem to have unlimited ammo.

I always thought, that if there were to be a sequel to the first that they would some what follow the sequel to the original. Flying Piranhas, sure it would be kind of stupid, but nothing like this.
I would say, Redbox this movie if you have to see this. Unless you can get it below $10 for 3D, $5 for just blu ray... $1 for DVD. I wouldn't buy it.
