Watch this when....you are nostalgic for a bright, happy blast from the past.  This is a great old movie (1961); it's got a score by Rodgers and Hammerstein, it's set in late 1950s Chinatown in San Francisco, and it's fun to watch.  It's an adaptation of hit Broadway musical comedy.  The colors and costumes are wonderful; the songs and choreography are very well done and highly entertaining.  It's the story of a traditional Chinese girl who has, along with her father, entered the country illegally, for an arranged marriage to the son of a San Francisco family.  The problem: the parents have made the marriage arrangements, and the son who is supposed to be the happy and dutiful groom is a thoroughly Americanized nightclub owner with a thing for one of his dancers.  He doesn't want to alienate his family, but he's got a life and plans of his own.  How do you keep everybody happy when generations and lifestyles collide?

The cool thing about this movie is that it went against the late 50s stereotypes by portraying Chinese characters as groovy swingers.  And the cast was nearly all-Asian; remarkable for that era.  Don't look for cultural authenticity here: many of the actors are actually Japanese not Chinese; there is such a thing as a flower drum, but it's not used in the manner portrayed in the movie, and when it comes right down to it, a lot of the elements of this movie are kind of hokey.  But you know what?  I love this movie, it's bright, it's cheesy, it's simplistic, it's a no-brainer, it's fun fun fun ~ it's an Elvis movie with chop suey!!
