Predictable, condescending, and cliche. Leaves the viewer with an unsatisfied feeling, as if you could have just read the screenplay instead of watching the movie and you would come away the same for it. This is one of those obligatory heroin-escapes-abuser (and kicks his butt) flicks that it seems every great actress has made. Not that I am not all for any woman in real life who does so, mind you, but I think there has to be a more to the story in terms of the plot in order to make it worthwhile, and this one falls short. The villain is utterly two-dimensional and flat with not one thing that makes him interesting or sympathetic. The rest of the characters aren't much better.

Here's the movie in a nutshell for anyone that would like to save their money or 1-1/2 hours of their time (SPOILER ALERT):

Beautiful young woman lives in a beautiful modernized beach home with abusive spouse. Abusive spouse is an evil S.O.B. the audience hates at first sight.

Beautiful young woman cleverly fakes her death one night in the middle of a storm on a boat outing, dons a disguise and escapes to a new town where she starts a new life with new job, new home and new beau that is nothing at all like abusive ex-husband.

Abusive ex-husband figures out "deceased" wife is still alive, hunts her down to her new location, breaks into her home one night armed with a gun and knocks the new beau unconscious. Beautiful woman manages to get gun away from ex-husband, shoots him dead and calls 911. Or maybe she calls 911 and then shoots him dead? (can't remember, doesn't matter). Beautiful woman and new beau live happily ever after.

The end.

Oh, the only thing not mentioned above that you might miss is the food (I'm a movie-foodie) that the characters dined on. Menus include:

- Freshly-dug clams in herb broth;
- Lamb with peach chutney, new potatoes, baby peas, and herb bread;
- Pot roast with apple pie.

The food was the most interesting part.

Now, the end.
