THE PLAGUE is about all the children of the world suddenly and simultaneously going into a coma. From then on, every child that is born is born into a comatose state, without fail. During the time that the kids are in a coma, they all have seizures simultaneously twice a day like clockwork. Ten years later, out of nowhere the kids (most of them now teenagers or young adults) awaken from their coma and go on a rampage, killing every adult in sight. Once the stage is set and the group of protagonists are introduced (a nurse, a couple of police officers, an ex con and his buddy, and two teenagers who were only a handful of kids who did not succumb to the coma years earlier), the movie revolves around a few things: the creepy kid scenario, WHY the kids are doing what they're doing, and survival.

I actually enjoyed THE PLAGUE more than the average straight to video, low budget Horror film. The visuals and photography were slightly above average for a low budget Horror movie and the overall product is a bit more aspirational than your typical low budget Horror movie. I appreciated a few things about the movie: the film took itself seriously and didn't get silly and the kids in the movie almost resemble Zombies in that they're extremely pale and have blank looks on their faces, but they don't resort to "Zombie violence", meaning they don't eat brains or have an overwhelming urge to cannibalize their victims. They usually prefer to snap people's necks and break bones. The violence in the film is actually surprising because there is a lot more than you would think and it does get pretty brutal at times, but not OVERLY brutal. The actors in the film aren't bad either. I thought pretty much everyone in the cast was either really good or decent. Most low budget movies usually never fail to cast at least ONE actor or actress I can't stand, but not this one (well, James Van Der Beek kind of gets on my nerves a little). There are also a lot of creepy moments in  the movie. Normally I find the whole "Creepy Kid" genre to be stupid, but this movie actually pulled it off to a certain degree. Some of the Extras who played the kids were a little goofy or ridiculous, but for the most part it was OK. Overall I liked the movie, but I did have some problems with it. My problems were mainly the plot holes. For example:
**Where was the Police Department?
**How can a group of 100 or so unarmed (and outnumbered) kids completely take over a town? From the time they wake up to within a 24 hour period, their town is basically reduced to a ghost town. Granted, the kids eventually figured out how to use firearms but it wasn't until the end of the movie. And the fact that they knew how to even operate firearms, let alone even still have the ability to WALK, after being in a coma for ten years is pretty ridiculous.
**The ending made no sense. It started to get biblical in explaining the origin of the coma kids but did not really elaborate on it.

The verdict: Don't expect a Zombie movie and don't expect a total gore-fest. The premise is great but wasn't really executed that well due to the script and probably due to budget constraints. THE PLAGUE is not a great movie by any means, but it's decent and worth checking out.
