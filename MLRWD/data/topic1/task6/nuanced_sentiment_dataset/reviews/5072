THE MATRIX: RELOADED--part two of the trilogy--is a good, relatively intelligently-written film for its genre.

This movie is an ambitious fantasy which achieves nearly-perfect internal consistency.  And it's a decent middle chapter because it reveals a new strategic layer of the enemy's machinations while expanding the "Matrix" settings, including Zion.

Happily, this sequel doesn't much feel like it had been forced into existence for commercial reasons--although we all know it was! At this point, only the proffered reintroduction of Smith and the proffered replacement of Tank are awkwardly forced. In other words, the film offers no convincing internal justification as to why Smith could not have stayed dead, and why Tank could not have stayed alive.

You'll appreciate this movie if you are either: a connoisseur of imaginative action scenes; or a returning fan who understands the backstory and enjoyed its sci-fi/metaphysical mix (however, this time, you won't even get hints of answers to the metaphysical questions...instead, you'll just be promised a future "enlightenment payoff" which THE MATRIX: REVOLUTIONS shall fail to deliver).
