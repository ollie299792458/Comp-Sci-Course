Appleseed is a good film and it is one of those movies that you put on when you don't want to do any thinking.  First off, I love the music and it does a great job capturing the future because of the electronic beats.  The graphics are stunning, but I feel as if I'm watching a CGI clip from a videogame.  The characters move in an unnatural sort of way even though their motions are fluid.  The plot is okay and I think they could have expanded further on the conflict between bioroids and humans instead of focusing on the heroine.  The action was excellent and the sound balancing of the explosions/music/speech was out of whack.  The sound effects are usually too quiet while the music and chatter is a bit loud.  Appleseed does have some cheesy dialogue scenes, but if they would have polished this film even more it could have been another successful film like Ghost in the Shell.  I sensed that once they cranked out the gorgeous graphics they were too exhausted to flesh out the final details that separate a superb and rare film from that of an okay one.
