My family is a major fan of the cartoon series - it has humor, great character development, developing story lines and people care about the characters and what will happen to them. I admin my family raved for months waiting for this movie to come out - and to say we were disappointed in what M. Night Shyamalan did with this movie would be an understatement. My oldest daughter got mad and walked out of the movie, my 8 year old kept asking questions like "why do they keep mispronouncing their names" and "I'm bored Daddy". My middle daughter kept saying "this sucks". I just dont know what he was thinking - I went so far as to read up on the posts to see what he was thinking - and he said that he wanted people to take this movie seriously so he cut out alot of the humor - and he cut out Sokka's girlfriend and the Kyoshi warriors - even though they were filmed in the original movie. They even considered cutting Mo Mo - Aang's flying monkey out of the movie because "he didnt bring any value". Decisions like cutting the meeting of the Kyoshi Warriors was piviotal to the series. It was the first time we got to see that Aang was more than a silly kid but a true Avatar when Aang had to make a decision to take the battle away from the village or people would get hurt, it was the firs time that Katara realized that Aang was not only a powerful avatar but still a child when she had to rescue him, it was the first time that Sooka realized that the feministic view he had of woman from growing up - could be wrong when he was defeated by the Kioshi Warriors and had to suck it up and ask to be trained by them and it was the first time we really saw Zuko as a threat as he attacked the village. These were all pivotal to the character development of the main characters including the growing relationship between Sooka and Suki.

Summary:
 - All the humor was removed
 - Character development was removed
 - Asian nature of the movie was removed - even the Wise old uncle was changed to a younger european character
 - Katara as a strong female fighter struggling in a mans world was removed
 - Sooka's love relationship with Soki was removed
 - Some of the special effects were great
 - To some it seems as if the director did not take time to watch the episodes, or at least did not care enough about them, and did not make the movie similar to the original television series as he left out essential fight scences (eg. Fight between Katara and master Paku) and did not get crucial details right and left out one of the most important of all, Sokka's sarcasm. - The final scene with the water tribe was rewritten from the original
 - First day box office sales were over $40 million - the second week dropped to a staggering $17 million and lower after that due to word of mouth and reviews from critics.
 - The script writing was very poor - leaving key elements of the story left to a film full of narratives that pulled the viewers through the movie.
 - Roger Ebert gave it half a star saying the movie "Bored and alienated its audiences" and noted the extremely poor use of 3D
 - Average score online for the movie was 2.8/ 10 based on 161 reviews of the movie

Do yourself a favor and watch the Cartoon Series - its a five star must have purchase compared to this movie's zero star.
Before buying this movie, rent it. Those who have seen and are fans the Nick Cartoon Series will be extremely upset and those who have not - may find the movie tolerable, good special effects but ultimately will find it dull.

Its truly a pitty too - as the live action version of the Nick Series could have been one of the greatest movie series since Star Wars - but M. Night Shyamalan didn't even watch the cartoon series or listen to what fans thought made the original so great before writing the movie. Shyamalan argued that his style and art-form of storytelling resulted in the negative reviews of the film and compared it to asking a painter to change to a different style, "I bring as much integrity to the table as humanly possible. It must be a language thing, in terms of a particular accent, a storytelling accent. I can only see it this certain way and I don't know how to think in another language. I think these are exactly the visions that are in my head, so I don't know how to adjust it without being me."

I just pray that he watches the cartoon series before royally messing up chapter two of the story. Toph as a blind tough girl, Princess Azula's relationship with her brother Zuko, Azula's friends Mai and Ty Lee and King Bumi may all get the axe knowing Shyamalan. Azula's friends betraying here are key to Azula going mad but I'm betting he will cut them - like he did Suki from the first movie.
