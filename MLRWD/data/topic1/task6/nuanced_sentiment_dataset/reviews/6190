"The Duelists" - a short story by Polish author Joseph Conrad (known mostly for his sea stories), is a film about two hussar officers in Napoleon's army who fight a series of duels over a minor slight. Keith Carradine is more than willing to forget the matter, but Harvey Keitel is vindictive and will not let it drop until either he or Carradine are dead.

The film is wonderfully shot, its existing light scenes are as evocative as Kubrick's big budget film "Barry Lyndon." There is a lot there for the Napoleonics junkie to delight in, such as the fencing master teaching Carradine (these were usually enlisted men who taught their officers how to fence), the regimental surgeon (Tom Conti). However, when I first saw the film I screamed at the screen, the Imperial Eagle on the shakos, or "cuckoo," did NOT appear until 1804! Grrr!

Nevertheless, the actors gave terrific performances. Unlike some people, I did not mind the accents - different countries have different regions, each with its own accents and verbiage. I was swept away then when I saw the film, and am swept away now with the DVD. All in all, I thought the film did an excellent job portraying an unexplored facet of Napoleon's army, that of dueling, which was rampant. Too bad it did not do well commercially (Americans prefer crashes and crass sex crap), but among Napoleonic junkies, the film is a hit!
