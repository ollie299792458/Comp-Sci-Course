If season 4 is any indication what would have happened to Lark Rise had it continued, I'm glad the nail was put in the coffin.

There are six episodes for this season and only one really caught my attention. That was the one where Mrs. Brown was going to play cricket. I thought that one captured the magic of previous seasons. The rest were pretty dull. The pig episode with Twister felt like an older episode as well, but I hated Twister as a character so I couldn't stomach the episode. I know others loved this season, and I wanted to as well, but I think the writing was lacking. Minnie was also bothersome. I think she became more annoying as the series went on.

The last episode deals with change coming to Lark Rise. I thought this should have been weaved throughout the previous 5 episodes. Anyway, season 4 is wrapped up with a nice little bow. Overall, it was a good season but not the greatest, and I wish the BBC would have allowed additional episodes to be made of this season. Perhaps then  it would have been better.

It's nice to watch the final 6 episodes so you can see what happens, but it isn't necessary. I'm sure everyone can figure out what happens on their own, if they let their imagination run wild.

I strongly suggest people renting this from blockbuster or netfix. I think the price for this DVD set is too high for what you get.
