Is it possible to love something and hate something at the same time???  With Ralph Bakshi's "Fire and Ice" the answer is a resounding 'Yes'.

Ralph Bakshi--he who revived the Lord of the Rings saga and who made Spiderman a curious afterthought in his own cartoon series--teams up with Fantasy fixture Frank Frazetta to bring you "Fire and Ice", and make no mistake, Bakshi is running his usual playbook without mercy.

Let's see:

--He uses the same title fonts previously used in Lord of the Rings.

--It has a very similar musical score used previously in Lord of the Rings.

--The roto-scope technique of animation using live-action overlayed with unshadowed animation cells.

--The Villain is an Elric-esq character named Nekron (a retread name from a much more interesting "Nekron 99" in Wizards)

--You have Generic Fantasy Guy II named Dark Wolf (again a retread of the name "Black Wolf" from Wizards)

and on and on.

This movie really has no reason to exist, other than play othen poplar cinematic trends at the time and glorify Frazetta's bulging muscle, unclothed and unshod take on the fantasy genera.  The plot is your standard fantasy fare, the characters are as thin and flat as the plastic they're painted on (and, given Princess Teegra's "perky" anatomy, that's saying something). The Villains are ridiculous and rather pointless and the ending so predictable you might as well not even watch.

Yet, I keep coming back for more.

Why do I keep coming back for more??

I watched this on Netflix, gave it 1 star, and then immediately bought it on Amazon. I utterly hate it when I'm watching, yet I think about it when I'm not.  Princess Teegra, barefoot and pretty much naked throughout the film, is an insult to womankind everywhere, yet I find myself facinated with her.  How weird is that??

This is one of those select films that, despite its endless flaws and general unwatchability, manages to install itself in your soul and not let go.

I suppose that says something.
