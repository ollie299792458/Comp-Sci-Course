Steve McQueen stars opposite his real-life wife Ali McGraw in this action thriller, directed by Sam Peckinpah.  Peckinpah goes a little mild in this film, especially when compared to such other films of his as the Wild Bunch, but this movie is still pretty violent, and has a lot of action.  Doc (McQueen) is a newly paroled prisoner who, in exchange for his freedom, agrees to do a job for the man (Ben Johnson) who helped him get parole.  What Doc doesn't know is that his wife (McGraw) also had to sleep with this man to gain her husband's freedom.  The result, when Doc finds out, is that he and his wife spend most of the movie squabbling about their relationship while they try to get safely to the Mexican border. 
Basically, the plot of the movie revolves around the bank robbery gone wrong.  There is more here, though, and this is what saves the movie from being just another dull action flick.  The relationship between Doc and his wife is very compelling, and developed interestingly as the movie progresses.
The movie is well directed, and Steve McQueen is great as always.  Still, this isn't one of the best movies of the era, and cannot even really be considered a classic of the period.  Despite this fact, however, The Getaway is a good movie, and worth seeing.
