I remember when this movie came out in 1985 I was in 7th grade and our class along with the whole school (3rd to 10th grade) were forced to go see this movie. It was a terrible experience! I can`t forget having agonizing headache after watching this movie. Pale faces of my friends were showing deep affection after watching those horror scenes, we all feeled deep hatred towards evil Germans. We all grew on communist propaganda and didn`t doubt for a second everything that was shown in this "piece of art".
Only after Lift of "iron curtain" and reading countless books about WW2 (not in russian) I was able to start separating propaganda from reality. Sure, atrocities were done by germans in WW2, just as they were done by russians, just as they were done by french, english and americans. That`s why it`s called WAR!
Yes, germans executed red commissars and partisans, just like Gestapo arrested my grandmother for assisting partisans and noone saw her since. In german occupational forces eyes those were terrorists. So russian soldiers were raping and killing on occupied territories in East Prussia.
Taking separate scene and making movie about american soldiers killing the whole family and then taking turns in raping their daughter (Mahmoudiya, Iraq, 2006), would this fairly depict Americans? Could you based on this fact call it official line of American Occupational Force in Iraq?
I wouldn`t recommend watching this movie unless you are a schoolar doing research in the field of propaganda. This is definitaly "R" rated movie and should be on the same shelf with Nazi-era Goebbels propaganda material.
