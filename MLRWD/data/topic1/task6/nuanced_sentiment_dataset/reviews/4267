There are not enough superlatives for this DVD set and the concerts.

First, to address the issue of DVD problems that I have seen in some older reviews ......
There were NONE. The DVD set played perfectly with great audio and video throughout.
Would we ever expect less from Amazon.....

The 25th Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame Concerts are quite possibly the best we have ever seen.  Whether your rock is of the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's or this millennium, you should absolutely not miss this concert.

Come join a sold out NYC Madison Square Garden crowd for two nights of a multi-decade anthology of great rock and roll.
The list of artists is itself impressive. And they do perform their own classics throughout the concerts.
But what makes this a once-in-a-lifetime event is the way various artists crank out their music TOGETHER

Consider these examples ........

Crosby, Stills & Nash WITH Bonnie Raitt or Jackson Browne or James Taylor
Stevie Wonder WITH Smokey Robinson or John Legend or B.B. King or Sting or Jeff Beck
Simon and Garfunkel WITH Crosby & Nash or Dion
Aretha WITH Annie Lennox
Metallica WITH Lou Reed or Ozzy or Ray Davies or doing Seger (bonus disc.)
U2/Bono WITH Bruce Springsteen AND Patti Smith cranking out Because The Night and WITH Fergie AND Jagger nailing Gimme Shelter
Bruce and the full E Street Band WITH Sam Moore or John Fogerty or Darlene Love or Billy Joel
..... the list goes on and on .......

The original concerts were on HBO. We first saw them on Palladia and knew right away we had to have the DVDs.
The first 2 discs contain over 3 hours of the concerts with some performances not seen on HBO/Palladia.
The third disc is all bonus performances not shown on HBO

So grab your rockin' squeeze and favorite vino; crank up the volume and/or put on some headphones and
ROCK ON....................
Expect some chills ......
