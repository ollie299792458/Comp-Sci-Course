Okay... so I saw the first one. The story was weak, the humor jabs at your funny bone slighty, but the kills were all unique. They were fun to watch and kept you guessing how the next victim will get violated.

HOWEVER, the sequel... my God. The acting is so bad, there is a negative improvement from the last one. Basically the characters show emotions that are so damn obviously staged. You do not get pulled into the depravity and sadness of Victor's legend.

Then the backstory doesn't explain fully how Victor's curse began. I can't give anything away, but how a woman rises from the dead to give some voodoo curse because of some cheating makes 0 sense. Did she make a pact with the devil or was she the daughter of a witch. No idea, but not interesting at all.

The kills are lamer that a limbless baby. He just hacks at people once or shoves his fingers through them, then voila, a ton of fake blood gushes onto a tree or wall. This happens for everyone that dies pretty much. At least the director got his wish of putting the belt sander to the face in.

The comedy is poor too. Just a supposed funny black guy being bold and a naughty slut. They're both not funny... just the beginning when the video camera of the recently deceased porn director is found is LOL.

So anyways... story, acting, kills, and comedy are all horribly executed. It's a garbage movie with a weak ending to top it all off. Just stay away from this.

I watched it with 4 friends on some down time in the night. We wished we watched some other old horror movie again.
