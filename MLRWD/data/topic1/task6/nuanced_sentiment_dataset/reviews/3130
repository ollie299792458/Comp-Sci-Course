Happy Endings contains 3 stories. One is very good, the other pretty good, and the other uninteresting. Plot one tells of a woman's desire to seduce a gay bandmate's dad to get to his money. Number two details a young guy's attempt to make a great doucmentary by blackmailing Lisa Kudrow's Mamie character. The last depicts a gay man's (Steve Coogan's) attempt to prove that some lesbian friends of his used his lover's sperm to have a child. Got all that? Unfortunately, Happy Endings suffers from the recent Too Many Characters/Too Much Plot syndrome (see Syriana/She Hate Me/Magnolia). Some of the characters we care about, others we don't. The director should have eliminated the lesbian/gay couple plot entirely and focused on the other two. Or, even better, could have fixed on the Maggy Gillenhall story (which features a good performance by Tom Arnold). As it is, Happy Endings is too long and takes us down too many avenues to recommend it. When the writers have to use onscreen written narration to tell even more story, you know someone should have trimmed the script before they decided to shoot.
