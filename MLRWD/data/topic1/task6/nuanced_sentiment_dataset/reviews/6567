First off: as the others have said, this is one of the most visiually stunning movies you'll ever see. The degree of opulence, in wardrobe and set design, is astonishing.  It's hard to imagine Hollywood coming up with anything that could compete with the luxe setting of "Curse of the Golden Flower".  Unfortunately, although epic in scale (with grandiose personalities to match) there is no level upon which you are able to gain any empathy for the story's inhabitants.

"Curse of the Golden Flower" is a mythological tale of a chinese Empress who is being poisoned by her husband.  Bent on revenge, the Empress plots to overthrow the brutal Emporer during the Festival of the Golden Flower (side note: the flower in question is a chrysanthymum, and the ancient ties between China and Japan are previewed here, as Japan's modern-day Emporer rules from what is known as the "Chrysanthymum Throne").

Like "Hero", the film Zhang Zimou made before "House of Flying Daggers", this film contains scenes of enormous armies fighting to the death.  If you are a military historian you'll have an appreciation for actual tactics used in the repelling of the Empress's hordes, but for the rest of us it's another level of remove that seperates us from any human element that would keep us interested in these extended battle sequences.

IMO, Zimou does much better, both from a critcal and popular perspective, when his stories are smaller in scale.  "House of Flying Daggers" is, at its core, a love story.  As such, I became much more interested in the fates of each film's lovers, and that interest made the films more enjoyable than "Hero" or "Curse of the Golden Flower".  A more successful combination of stunning visuals and compelling stories can be found in "House of Flying Daggers" than in "Curse of the Golden Flower".
