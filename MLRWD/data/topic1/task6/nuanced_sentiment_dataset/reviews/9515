This film set out to make us pick sides, by using music, clothing, plot, and other tactics to pursuide us that the Americans are the "good guys" and the that the Germans are the evil enemys that have to be concured for the hope of man kind.
This film trys to make you feel that the clean cut Americans have to capture the enigma machine so that the world will be saved. They try to personalise it by seeing that the Luitenent fails to become a captain and that all the crew love him.
This film trys to makes the Germans out to be filthy and brutal by killig the survivers of the submarine which the blew up. The also made the Germans look bad by when the Americans let the Captain live, how he escapes and sabortages the sub.
Even the History is wrong, because it was the Britz that actually captured most of the enigmas and who also cracked the code not the "brave" Americans.
Over all this film decives ytou to make you believe that you should be baraking for the Americans 10 mins into the movie. it is a very crewl and deceptive film. I can not belive that such a lie was even let out on film let alone of Vidio and DVD.
P.S. I recomend to not watch this if you have not seen this before!!!
