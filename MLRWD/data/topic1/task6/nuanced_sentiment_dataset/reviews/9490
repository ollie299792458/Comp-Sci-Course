LOTS OF THINGS GOING ON
This was an interesting movie in one sense, all these lives intertwined. The growth and personal lives of the characters However, I felt there was so much going on that you never got the full import of how each character was developing, until later thinking about the movie.
R.G. COYLE WAS A VICTIM OF HIS OWN INACTION
First there was Kevin Spacey's (R.G. Coyle) character and his relationship with his abusive parents.  His character was that of a beaten dog.  He runs into the character of Petal played excellently by Cate Blanchett.  She continues the abuse but also provides him with a daughter, Bunny.  
His father's exit from this world is announced to him in the most causual of ways, which starts a snowball of tragedies just as an unknown aunt (Judy Densch) appears on his doorstep.
LIFE IN NEWFOUNDLAND
It is clear that life feels too much for R. G. Coyle.  It all happens to him.  He grudgingly accepts the suggestion of his long lost aunt to return to his family's former homeland.  His last name opens some doors for him and his peculiar new life is begun.
His new home is in northern Canada, where fishing and shipping is the lifeblood of the town.  His name carries weight, but he is surprised at its significance.  Everyone seems to know more than him.  Secrets abound, even within his own family.  
A town widow befriends him, and their relationship develops but not without its troubles.
Not a lot changes but what does change,  changes for everyone.  This would have been easier to follow as a book as each person's life from his employer and his son, his co-workers, his aunt, the widow and her son and his daughter's lives are all intricated weaved and changing with time.  A lot like real life, but then in real life the focus is a bit more narrow.
It was a interesting movie but like life, only some moderate highs and some really major lows. Also there are some hokey aspects to the movie that didn't really make sense.
