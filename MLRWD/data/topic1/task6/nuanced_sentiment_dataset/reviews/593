You may find this title worth your purchase if your a Ben Affleck fan. Otherwise I'd pass it by. I own all of the previous Tom Clancy film adaptations and this is my least favorite. In fact, having not seen the movie prior to purchasing the DVD, I now wish I had bought something else instead. Both Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford (who played the central character in the past)were much better cast as the character Jack Ryan. They brought more depth to the character of Ryan. The story itself is not bad, and is quite a plausible scenario given today's world climate. However Ben Afflec running around the "hot zone" of a nuclear detonation with a PDA and cell phone is a farce. (I guess it was a special bomb with no radioactive fallout? By the end of the movie everything is hunkydory and he seems to have no ill effects from running around in high radiation levels) Also you will find yourself screaming in your head at what Afflec should say in a given situation. (As it would only make common sense) Where he instead usually tries to justify himself, rather than convey the critical information he knows. (Ie- The bureaucrat on Air Force 1 hangs up on him...because instead of telling him an important piece of info he has, he instead bumbles through trying to justify himself). Even a layperson would have reacted better being guided by simple human nature and common sense. Bad script, or bad acting?
