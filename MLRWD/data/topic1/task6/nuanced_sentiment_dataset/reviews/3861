I saw this film, with high expectations, in the theater. I thought Sheridan had done a good, though not great, job on "In the Name of the Father," capturing some of the reality of the Irish situation.
"The Boxer" has no appealing characters.  Brian Cox comes closest. The British are portrayed in the age-old, inaccurate role of "honest brokers" among the irrational, bloodthirsty Irish stereeotypes. The IRA man trying to mess up Cox's peace initiative seems to represent Sheridan's attempt to wrap up a goofy and unwieldy plot.
As the choppy plot unfolded, I expected that at least the Day-Lewis character would resist adultery with his friend's wife. This struggle, though nearly lost in the unlikely political plot, was the most compelling thing in the movie. Unfortunately, the film dashed even that minimal expectation. Day-Lewis rekindles his romance with a woman who is married to his imprisoned friend. So why should the audience empathize with these characters?
