5 of the 6, Five Star Reviews are from the same People, I mean come on already. I understand that your fans of Conan and that he really needs them. Remember, there is a reason that he didn't make it on the Tonight Show, he's just not that funny and couldn't hold the original Tonight Show audience. He has a tired and very bland type of humor, that appeals to insomniacs, and couldn't come up with the talent to hold the mainstream Tonight Show viewers. It had nothing to do with any mysterious plot between NBC and Jay Leno, to get rid of Conan. Conan didn't want to go back to his previous slot, acted childish over his incompetence, and quit. Now don't get me wrong, Jay Leno is no Johnny Carson either, but he was at least able to capture the next generation of Tonight Show viewers. I think that the only difference between Conan and Charlie Sheen and their ranting over studio treatment is that Conan wasn't on drugs and looking like he was next in line to see his dealer. Conan has a talent for a certain type of audience, and they will always like him and therefore may always have a job somewhere, but stop crying about the talent he imagines he has, and try and improve, instead of staying with the tired old routines, like they are going to get better the next time he does them. Growth comes with change.
