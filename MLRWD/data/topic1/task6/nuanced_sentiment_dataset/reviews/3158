This album was great. I think that I'm the only guy in my class that owns this Cd, and am not ashamed to say it either. I was once in a record store, when I looked over at the new release section and seen the Spice Girls new CD. I was a Spice Girl fan when "Spice" came out, but then died  off, due to no releases. When I seen the new album, I basically, was like  "oh wow, they have new CD out, good for them" basically thinking  that my days as a Spice Girl fan was over. I went home that very same day,  and seen "Spice Up Your Life" on MTV, and loved it. I bought  "Spiceworld" two days later! What a great bargain! I ended up  having to buy the CD 4 times, cuz i ruined the other ones. I have a CD  tower, which I place my CD's from my favorite, to least favorite. Number 1  is "Northern Star" from Melanie C, followed by "Spice  World" from the Spice Gals! Later on in 1998, I bought there single  "Goodbye" which I hope is on the album that they are going to  release in fall. Speaking of which, will have the first single off of it  titled "Let Love Lead The Way" Well, there isn't much else to  say, except that Spiceworld with worth the $ you pay!
