That line of dialogue from David Lynch's unquestioned masterpiece BLUE VELVET describes Lynch's film universe perfectly.  With the new SPECIAL EDITION dvd out we truly get a glimpse inside the making of a great film and how it can immediately be misunderstood by someone like Roger Ebert.  The behind the scenes documentary is great with interviews from many of the film participants.  To enter the world of David Lynch is to cross into an unknown vortex of subconscious desires, fears, and dreams.  The film brilliantly shows us the illusion of the perfect smalltown life vs. the city underworld right next door.  The images stay with you long after the movie is over.  Dennis Hopper is absolutely perfect in a harrowing, funny, and brutal psychopath filled with self loathing and anger.  I just saw a revival showing at a theater in Los Angeles and I highly recommend to anyone to see it in a theater if possible.  On the big screen the movie envelops you into its world from which there is no escape.  BLUE VELVET is definitely not for everyone, and that's ok.  Lynch wasn't trying to make a film for the masses, but rather as a complete personal expression in the movie art form.
