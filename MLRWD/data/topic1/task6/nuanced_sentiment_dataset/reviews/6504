well first,  i have watched many of the actors in many different role on canadian tv shows and thought they were superb. rob wells from trailer park boys, the guy who played stanley tweedle on lexx, the guy who played the police chief was in trailer park boys,and of course rutger hauer from every other great film he's been in.  someone needs to tell these folks this is a career killer. like when you eat tomato soup and get the runs for a week, you never  want tomatoes soup or any thing out of a bowl for the next 6 months.  now i realize this is a low budget  film where actors had to bring their own lunch and made literally tens of dollars, and they probably had the feeling their time was worth more than this. but hey sometimes you have to do an artsy film once in a while. you know for the fans. if poor acting from very talented people is what you're after, you are in store for a buffet like no other.  but i guess the directors and producers say what is good and what is not. if you thought sin city or shoot em up was campy and over the top. if you saw michael myers and thought he was mean and evil, watch hobo and mike myers and jason vorhees will seem cuddly.  i have watched a few whizbang films and somebody at whizbang took a whiz on the script saw it was yellow and thought it was gold. but that's just my opinion, i could be wrong.
