The Ripper goes into a mans body, causing him conflicted and trying to fight the demon that is inside of him until he starts killing his pregnant wife and others around him. after an ambulance crash into the river, his body is never to be found and 16 years later 7 kids were born the day he died, possiably reincarnated souls that he killed before. the ripper returns and takes the soul of one of the kids and one by one kills them all. The lead charector nicknamed Bug collects all the souls the ripper kills and they protect him, he is also the son that the previous person the ripper possessed. he was the miracle baby and his sister who survived that brutal night 16 years ago. Finally the kid who is possessed by the ripper is revealed. The problem with this movie is theres no great showdown towards the end, not like wes cravens other films. Its too talky and loses its entertainment value. It has an interesting idea, I think if this movie was about a supernatural entity that was creature thing like killing kids it would be more effective, instead its some val mouth serial killer in a bad suit. the condor suit looked more creepy looking than the ripper. a medicore wes craven flick with a few good ideas but lacking with unrelateable charectors & a buildup to a weak ending.
