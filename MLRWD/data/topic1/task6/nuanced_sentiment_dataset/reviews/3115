DC Comics has done a nice job again with animation and the story, but what's with their DVDs lately? A bland DVD menu. No chapters! What's the sense of a DVD if there is not a motion DVD menu, chapters and extra stuff? I'm not talking about previews of other movies. Maybe an isolated soundtrack would be nice. The DVD box is getting thinner and cheaper. We might as well purchase this on itunes. When I buy a DVD or a CD, I want the media to be taken advantage of to the max. He-Man: Master of the Universe is an excellent example of what I'm talking about. This is packaged beautifully. Also, why is this made in 2:35:1 aspect ratio when it's a direct-to-DVD movie? I mean, this movie is wider than my widescreen tv so there is a black space above and below. I hate that. Go back to the 1:78:1 ratio as before. Why not package the movie with the CD soundtrack and charge a little more?
I don't have a blu-ray player yet but I hope DC Comics takes advantage of this technology when it comes to menus, etc. If not, what a waste of money. I still love the dirct-to-DVD movies their making but I think it's best to purchase it on itunes on Amazon video instead for the DVD format.
