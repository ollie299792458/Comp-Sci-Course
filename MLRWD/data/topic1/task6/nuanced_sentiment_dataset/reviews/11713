Like some of the previous reviewers, I discovered these movies after seeing The Artist with Jean Dujardin. I decided to see what other films he was in since he has such a charming and humorous appeal on screen and off. I decided to watch this film and absolutely loved it! His performance in this film was superb and dead on. In my opinion, this is probably one of the best spy sattires I have ever seen. I thought the mix of suave James Bond with a mixture of a clueless Inspector Clouseau and Detective Frank Drebin was incredible. There were numerous moments that reminded me of Leslie Nielsen in the Naked Gun movies. I think having a sauve character that was either conveniently good as a spy or somehow horrendous was a wonderful mixture and made a fantastic character come alive. Also, I loved that the film style was made as if it was produced in the era it was depicting. I thought it gave a nice touch to the film because for me it really set the mood for me in terms of it being set in the 50s. Great film and I would recommend the sequel!
