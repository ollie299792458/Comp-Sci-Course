Then again I'll watch any movie has the much less famous, often severely under-rated younger Firth brother in it.

(Ok, I'm admittedly smitten, not with the infinitely more well-known Colin, but with his rather splendid character-driven baby brother.)

Fact is this was a rather lack-luster sequel, but I've watched it SEVERAL times, actually bought the darned DVD despite myself to see Jonathan Firth's Soren.

MHO, on the Prince and Me 2?

I didn't like  the some of the changes at all. The subtraction of the younger sister, the old king and queen's surprise transformation and the old king's resurrection or remission or whatever THAT was. (Made NO sense that, now WHY was Edward made king again?) I desperately missed Julia Stiles, that's for sure. But other than an awkward moment or two for Luke Mably I thought the rest of the cast was just fine.

But honestly I didn't miss Ben Miller's "Soren" at all. I didn't mind him in the first film, but in all honesty I thought the character a bit bland compared to the way he was portrayed in part 2. Maybe I am biased, but I rather liked the direction Jonathan Firth took him in. I thought it was understated, very charming, and VERY funny.

Worth watching the rest of it for?

Yep...
