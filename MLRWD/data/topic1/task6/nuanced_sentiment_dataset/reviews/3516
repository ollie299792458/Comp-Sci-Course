There are very few films about vampires, much less about Dracula, that I enjoy or will endorse. 1922's Nosferatu is ground-breaking and stunning for its time, and Werner Herzog's 1979 remake is simply the best of the genre. I heard about the film "Shadow Of The Vampire, but basically ignored it, thinking it was just another sad attempt at cashing in on a far too trite genre. However a while later, I took a chance and purchased "Shadow Of The Vampire" on video, brought it home and watched it. Needless to say, I was impressed and amazed how good this film is! How could there yet be another film about Nosferatu that is original and worth watching, I kept saying to myself? Well, this movie prooves that there is, as well as how there can be.
"Shadow Of The Vampire" is a film within a film; a story within a story. It is a film about the crew and director and players who made the original 1922 Nosferatu--but it is not a docu-drama. It is an orginal story of fiction that touches on non-fiction. 
The movie is full of grace, elegance, atmosphere, wit, and refinement. The acting performances, particularly by Willem Dafoe and John Malkovich, are superb and brilliant. The musical score is tasteful and effective. 
"Shadow Of The Vampire" isn't a particular scary film, but it certainly does get creepy at times, and can be quite disturbing. It is the great sense of wit and unintentional (at least in appearance!) humour finely woven throughout this film that keeps it from becoming the usual Vampire fodder; not to mention the clever story with its twist after twist.
Brilliant.
