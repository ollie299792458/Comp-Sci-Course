The trouble with Harry is that he's dead, and everyone seems to have a different idea of what needs to be done with his body. In this film Alfred Hitchcock throws viewers a twist as, instead of the usual mystery/suspense fare of legend, he serves up a black comedy about a corpse. From the onset I doubted this film, wondered if there'd be anything there to cultivate a worthwhile experience. Press play. My first impression was visceral reaction as I wondered at the breathtaking Vermont fall foliage shots that grace the film's opening moments. Striking stuff, and surprisingly sharp color and detail for being over 50 years old. So after a quirky introduction credit sequence, things begin humming along and, really, I wasn't into it at all. There was a type of humor there I recognized as something that just didn't connect with me, albeit more in implementation than theme. Furthermore, the movie has some serious issues with voice dubbing and synchronization. I was therefore standing on the edge of perhaps the first Hitchcock film I wasn't going to benefit from at all. As it turned out, it took about half the movie for me to finally get into the sprit of this brand of macabre comedy and begin to appreciate it for what it was. I even laughed two of three times. A young John Forsythe stars in a lead role and does a fair job with his character. Shirley MacLaine makes her film debut with a memorable character; it's amazing that the young actress onscreen here is the same person that exists with that name today. Time does remarkably tragic things to people. But the best character in the movie was the charismatic Captain, played to perfection by the late Edmund Gwenn. The score is noteworthy as well, setting the perfect tonality for a theme that is coexistently comedic and twisted. In the end, definitely not one of my favorite Hitchcock outings, but I developed an appreciation for it as it wound along, and a few laughs as well.
