How naive of me to have expected this movie to show any depth when it was made after all by the same director who gave us the infamous "Murmurs of the heart", a "beautiful", "sensitive" movie about incest; this last tabu being broken and commercially exploited by Malle, should have warned me to stay away from his other "oeuvre" bearing the same superficiality and immaturity with a seasoned eye to commercialism. The film does reflect the inbuilt hypocrisy of the boys to their religion, but the dialogue shows very little reference to the war going on and the constant references to sex are there to amuse rather than to portray a picture of the times. Based on the well known French Antisemitism, the friendship between the wealthy French boy and his Jewish class mate had very little reason for it and was hardly credible. The Germans were not portrayed as savages in their dealing with the caught Jewish boys, and would surely have never allowed the boy to pack his suitcase. All in all a boring superfluous movie about a terrible period in history. Both should have been avoided at all costs.
