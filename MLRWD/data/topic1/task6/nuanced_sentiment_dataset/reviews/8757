My son and I saw the preview of DINOSAUR in the theatre when we went to see TOY STORY 2. DINOSAUR'S preview soared--the blending of natural landscapes and CGI creatures looked seamless and enthralling . . . until the rubber-faced simian peaked at the egg. When, months later, my son and I saw the film in the theatre, I felt that the majority of the creativity and ingenuity went towards the opening sequence featured so prominently in the preview. DINOSAUR's story, as other reviewers have noted, is so derivative that only a small child would be diverted by it; the more traditionally animated creatures in the LAND BEFORE TIME series have more charm, even if they are too sweet for the older kids. Unfortunately, this film has elements that many parents may deem inappropriate for small children; explosions and other violence will lead to wakeful nights.
I find it distressing that a company that can innovate so well, giving us the "Deep Canvas" of TARZAN and the wonderful alliance with Pixar studios, could not develop a better showcase for its technical innovations than this forgettable film. If you want CGI dinosaurs, treat yourself to the BBC production of WALKING WITH DINOSAURS (and watch it with your kids, too). If you just have to have dinosaurs in a cute "friendship triumphs over all" story, go with a LAND BEFORE TIME tape. But if you want to see something more than cleverly rendered, photorealistic dinosaurs, you'll have to look somewhere else.
