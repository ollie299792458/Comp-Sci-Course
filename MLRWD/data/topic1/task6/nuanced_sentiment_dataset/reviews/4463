Jennifer's Body isn't a horribly awful film, isn't even close to being a horribly awful film.  The Phantom Menace was a horribly awful film, thanks to Jar Jar.  Megan plays the demonic bitch card very well, almost as if it's is second nature.  Her cutesy little lines, although a bit too Cody typical, are still amusing at times and her co-star is also quite a lil firecracker as well.  The script could have used a bit more meat, for example they could have added a bit more material for the band.  And the film has a strong campy 80's horror film vibe which should have been played up and it would have been even funnier if they had used old hair rock bands for the soundtrack.  The whole satan theme just screamed for a hair metal soundtrack and a hair metal band in the bar scene.  But Diablo is such the lil hipster that she probably thought it was hipper to go with bands that'll be forgotten five years from now.

Now Rob Zombie, that dude knows how to put together a soundtrack for a horror flick, especially the soundtrack for RZH2.

In short, the actors did what they could do and they weren't as awful as I expected them to be.

The script could have used a lot of work and it should have been even cornier.

The soundtrack is a steaming pile of useless teenyboppin nonsense but for some reason they thought it would be a good idea to put trendy teen bands in an R rated movie.

Megan should have slipped a lil nippage.. it would have boosted the box office numbers without a doubt.  The minute it became obvious she wasn't going to, the interest in the flick seemed to dry up. That girl needs to realize that the majority of men out there don't want to see her mouth move, they want to see her tits bounce.
