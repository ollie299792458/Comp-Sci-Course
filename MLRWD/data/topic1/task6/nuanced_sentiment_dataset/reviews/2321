The film "Boondock Saints" far surpasses most Hollywood productions from the outset simply by incorporating a plot different from the mainstream.  Although the film contains the usual amount of violence and killing for an action movie, this film has the merit that the motive for the murders is very clear, and quite possibly justifiable.  The social and moral questions raised throughout the film cannot help but elicit at least some critical thought.  But don't worry about being forced to think too hard; the film is routinely punctuated by witty dialogue and amusing circumstances.  The main characters, two selfless Irish brothers and a stray Italian, have delightfully good hearts and are endearing from the start.  Willem DeFoe puts forth one of his best performances ever, adding creativity to his rough and tough character by portraying an extremely self-assured gay FBI agent who doesn't quite admit his sexual orientation to himself.  His character is an excellent addition to the underlying religious theme of the movie as it pronounces the question of what purpose religion should serve, other than to provide moral direction.  The film is a must see for anyone who wants to determine what is truly morally correct, as well as anyone who just likes to watch a couple of nice Irish lads following their calling.
