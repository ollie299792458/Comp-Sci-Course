A while back I rented Twilight of the dark master and like I said above, Im glad I didn't buy it. The story was really interesting but if you don't pay close attention it will go way over your head. Trying to put that big plot in a 50 min. movie would be hard I can imagine.

 I saw the preview on Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust and I was like WOW, but when I watched that WOW turned into a AW. Not that much blood, gore, fighting, etc. not saying that it was bad for not having that kind of stuff, but the preview is very misleading.

 The HUGE thing that I liked about Twilight Of The Dark Master is that the artwork is GREAT. I mean this artwork is truly one of the best seen. It even shows you how the character designer drew the cover art which looked like it had taken him at least an hour(3x or 4x fastforward).

 I wouldn't recommend it if you like action but if your a plot throb that can keep up with a constant and confusing storyline or you like anime because of the artwork, I would suggest renting before you buy it.
