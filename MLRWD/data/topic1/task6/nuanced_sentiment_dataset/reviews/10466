The Grudge 3 continues the series several days after the events of the second movie. We lose the "jump around in the time line" aspect in this entry but that was getting pretty played out anyway.

It's basically Kayako doing what she does best, scaring the hell out of everyone and killing anyone who comes near her. The movie's not nearly as scary as the first while staying about as scary as the second as well as adding quite a bit of un-necessary gore; Kayako only makes one of her victims' bodies vanish this time around; the rest are set up as amusing tableaus a la Friday The 13th.

I was impressed with all of the acting this time around. The main character was an amazingly stupid woman but I really believed she was an amazingly stupid woman. The actress playing Rose, the young girl suffering from a completely unamed disease, was fun as anything to watch and hilarious to boot.

It was by no means an award winner but it's a nice addition to the series. MASSIVE points lost for sticking a now 14 year old Toshio in black swim trunks though. I'm no proponent for child nudity but it just looked weird.
