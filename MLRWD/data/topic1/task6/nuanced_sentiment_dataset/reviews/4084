I have fun with all of Terry Gilliam's quirky movies from this to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011E5RXO">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a> to the recent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN69B8">The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus</a>! Sadly, horrible picture quality drags this wonderful film down.

For Amazon reviews of older movies, I tend to assume that readers have a familiarity with the film already, so I'll instead focus on the question of how well the movie transfered to the Blu Ray format. The answer? Not well at all!

In fact, I think this is the worst Blu Ray transfer I've ever seen. Artifacts abound, from lines across the screen, to random specks. It's pretty awful in parts! It feels like I'm watching an old film reel on an elementary school projector.

You'll definitely notice that no effort appeared to be spent restoring the film for this release. I'm a bit saddened by it, too, because it distracts from the enjoyment of an otherwise interesting movie.

Four star movie, one star quality, two stars total.
