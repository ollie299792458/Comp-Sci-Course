This movie hangs out with Wing Commander and The Prince and Me on weekends, and it could never get a date with House of the Dead. With that said, this is one of the worst films to ever grace a theater.

It was so appallingly bad that the only conclusion I can draw about why it was so bad is that the major studios think the average John Q. Public is a knuckle-dragging caveman. The amount of money spent on "blockbusters" these days is pornographic, and to make matters worse, this is what they churn out: a horribly acted, plotless, worthless cgi-fest of an attempt at cashing in on a franchise name.

I personally was excited about this film when it was first announced. Sure, I thought it might not be "good" in the coffee house sense, or even "good" in the summer movie sense... and that would be ok! I wouldn't mind an over-acted action flick. But alas, this movie was utter torture to see. Ridiculous "facts," bizarre explainations of bizarre happenings, no character development, barely any speech, and a laughable scene near the end of the movie with a human and a predator out running an explosion together. With the physics of outrunning explosions aside, the overwhelming hilarity of the characters' expressions paired with the culminating music in this scene is vomit enducing enough to make me never enter a movie theater again.

In closing I will leave you with this:

NEVER SEE THIS MOVIE! Do not support horrid films.
