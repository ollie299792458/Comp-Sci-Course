This remake offers a few good, atmospheric sets that are apparently meant to be some kind of Nantucket-New Bedford mashup (don't ask). There are also a few interesting costumes, mixed in with a larger number which are questionable. Other than that, let me say this: several reviewers have tried to warn you how little respect this piece of trash has for Melville's plot or philosophy, but no one has been able to do justice to just how tedious the whole exercise is. Between being monotonous, illogical, digressive, long-winded, poorly written, and poorly edited, you are about to spend what feels like a week in front of the screen wondering how William Hurt can shout line after line in the same impotent rasp for so many hours without growing a nodule on his larynx. You could *almost* save this movie by cutting it down to less than a quarter of its running time. In fact, the more of it you cut, the more the movie could be saved. The perfect edition of this remake would probably run 1 minute 30 seconds.
