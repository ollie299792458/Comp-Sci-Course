Grave Encounters could have been a great horror film. That being said it's not really all that bad, but I expected more. First you will see a standard Blair Witch "this footage was found" speech that segues into a rip-off of Ghost Adventures right down to the taped Xs. Fortunately the lead character is not quite up to Zak Bagans' superhero level of douchebaggery, yet.  From there you will find yourself watching a decent ghost flick until they throw some creatures into the mix. I assume the creatures are some variety of face distorting demon. If you have seen 2005's Constantine you know what I'm talking about. You will also be introduced to a lobotomist that will supply the "plot twist" at the end. If you have seen 2001's Session 9 you have seen the twist. As a matter of fact if you have seen Ghost Adventures, Session 9, and the Korean ghost girl in car video on YouTube you have seen the whole freaking movie. For a lot less than six dollars. I must say I admire the Vicious Brother's total disregard for potential copyright infringement litigation. At multiple points in film you will find yourself thinking "These guys either have the world's greatest attorney or really large gonads."
