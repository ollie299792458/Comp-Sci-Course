I'd have liked to see some more character development, and I need to watch again to understand the ins and outs of the dirty cop stuff.  I was left wanting to know more about the brothers and their backgrounds and their mother as the person who took them in.  The movie was short, so there could have been time.

But other than that it was fantastic.  I love the "water can be thicker than blood" concept.  The brothers were charming and funny and yet you can't ignore their pasts and you wonder (at least in the case of Bobby) what they were up to right before their mother died.  Where was Bobby living, for example? Was Jack living with the mother? We know Angel was in the Army and we know about Jerry.

The brothers' banter and love was adorable and touching, as were tough guy Bobby's tears and Jack's sensitivity.

The bathroom scene was gasp-with-laughter.  I will die a happy woman now that I have seen Mark Wahlberg taking a crap onscreen.

Lots of shooting (which I had no problem with), which is par for the course for the amazing John Singleton, who was ROBBED of an Oscar for Boyz 'n the Hood.  Loved seeing him take the action from the sunny streets of LA to freezing Detroit.
