Besides the fact that this movie resembles a current movie and novel exceptionally closely this movie is technically flawed and about as interesting as paint drying. I picked it up because I happen to love B movies and Mark Dacascos and was hoping it would be entertaining. Save your time and watch a Sam Rami movie and/or read/watch I am Legend. Both have what it takes to make a memorable and enjoyable movie experience. Hey.... I wanted it to be good or at least interesting.

PS- The director vehemently denies ever have read OR seen/heard about .I Am Legend'. Please beware the imdb reviews unless you want to read the one guy who played ONE ZOMBIE in the movie (which is supposed to be another, completely different zombie each time) and the director defend the originality of the movie and Mark Dacascos being involved in the filming because he is a friend of the director. While they (doubtlessly) have other talents- it's kind of sad they have so much time to troll the forums to defend this rather lackluster rip-off film.
