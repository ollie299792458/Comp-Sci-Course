My absolute favorite film of all time - and finally in DVD format!!!  Could life get any better?!
It's a great joy to at last be able to view Auntie Mame's trailers, and the picture quality provided by DVD is a great improvement over VHS.  But enough of the technical stuff - let's get on to the film!
I don't know quite where to start in singing the praises of Auntie Mame - the humor, the message, the music, the costumes (oh, God - such wonderful costumes - Orry Kelly's best), everything - timeless in its charm.  Rosalind Russell is just amazing - her portrayal of this legendary character is perfection itself.  And her supporting actors are just marvelous, as well - Coral Browne as Vera Charles is tremendous.  And whoever says that the role of Ito is an embarrassment takes life too seriously. The film flows beautifully, and makes one wonder, "why does this ever have to end?"  One can easily see that the film is based on Patrick Dennis' stage play, complete with fade-outs, but that doesn't take anything away from it.  Rather, I feel it adds to the charm.
If you haven't seen Auntie Mame, please do so.  If you haven't seen it in awhile, have another look.  And if you've just seen it recently, isn't it worth another viewing?  This film is just that good - timeless humor and touching soul.  My only question is...why on earth did they have to go and create that monstrosity with Lucille Ball?  It brings down the integrity of this film, a real crime.
Please consider purchasing this DVD, even if you already have the film on VHS.  The special features are really great, and the picture quality is improved immensely.  Also, if you haven't read the book, definitely give it a chance.  I think it's even better than the film - there's so much to it that just couldn't fit into the film.
