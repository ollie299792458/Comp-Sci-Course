Simple.  Complete.  This movie and this family are both of those.  Paul Newman's chain saw taken to a desk is a simple and complete statement.  Fortunately the Stamper family is found throughou the U.S., not just in the coastal woods of Oregon.  (In my surveying work I work with a family owned pipeline company.  They enjoyed the movie a lot when I leant it to them ans said the Stampers reminded me of them.)  Lee Remick seems perfect for her role as Paul Newman's understanding wife who does question.  Michael Sarrizan is perfect as the younger half brother come back with a mission.  The scene of his full exhaustion after a morning of scrambling over, reaching around, and groping under large fallen trees with bark like a cheese grater is as true of a depiction as I have seen.  And that scene shows "This guy 'ain't quittin'." or maybe you could say "Never give a inch.".  The older brother, Paul Newman, rounds out the above scene by bringing the Kid's lunch pail - and not just to harass him, I believe it was an act of true caring, just not very readable on the outside.  That is Hank Stamper all through the movie and is what helps make this such a wonderful film.
