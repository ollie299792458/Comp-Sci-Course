I'll be honest...I don't watch a whole lot of "foreign" movies because the dubbing is usually faulty and you end up missing details in the movie.  While the dubbing is somewhat faulty in this movie (compared to the subtitles) the story transcends the fault.  It's an extremely powerful movie despite the fact that the story is somewhat derivative.  It's more or less a drama with action intermixed; very well written and very indicative of the human condition (it feels authentic despite the fact that it's a Korean movie).  Be warned though, the action sequences are extremely graphic and bloody.

Problems:  The only problems I had was the introduction of the backstory of the character and him actually having a name.  While it forwards the plot somewhat I feel that it wasn't necessary for this kind of movie; it gives too much of a b-movie feeling to it (over-explanation).  In the end it reduces the impact somewhat but not enough to disrupt the movie.

It's a universal story and I doubt that hollywood won't try to replicate it in a couple of years.
