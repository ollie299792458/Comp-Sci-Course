The premise of the movie had the potential to produce one of the funniest and most relatable comedies of all time-- and somehow it didn't. It seemed to promise the same kind of that's-so-my-boss! exclamations that Office Space did, but none of the villains in Horrible Bosses seem real except maybe Farrell's greedy drug-addict character. Spacey and Aniston are basically cartoons in this movie, and although that makes for a few chuckles here and there, their characters just don't feel analogous to any horrible boss that anyone in the audience is likely to have worked for. So the movie operates in an old fashioned slap-stick manner, which feels unpleasantly dated in my opinion.

Of the three protagonists, Jason Bateman is the only I thought was really funny, but he's always good for a laugh.  I don't care for Sudeikis at all and that other fellow just seemed like he was in Jerry Lewis mode the whole movie.

But here's the brief:  This is not a classic comedy by any means, and I don't think anyone can truly relate to most of it's content, but it's worth watching for a descent amount of laughs and chuckles, especially if you're having a movie night with the gang.
