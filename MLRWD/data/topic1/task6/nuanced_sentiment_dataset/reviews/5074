...If you did, then the result would be Tobe a 17 year old geeky young man that looks like Napolean Dynamite and spews words way wiser than his years like Juno.
Tobe, the "dateless wonder" adores adult film star, Monica Velour from the 80's.  He is a collector of her bodies of work and even keeps a scrap book of all her movies and photos.

Upon graduating high school, his grandfather gives him the family "Weenie Mobile" a food truck that sells what else but hot dogs complete with a giant weenie on the roof of the vehicle.  Tobe decides to sell it and places an ad online.  He receives an offer from a man in Indiana and since he lives in Washington didn't want to drive all the way out to Indiana until he notices that Monica Velour is making a guest appearence in some club also in Indiana. The trip to Indiana is on.

Time and hard living, life has not been kind to Monica who is played by an almost unrecognizeable Kim Cattrell and she is superb.  The other actors are terrific too.  As a few other reviewers have stated, this film didn't get a lot of press and sort of disappeared.  Too bad - it was really enjoyable.
