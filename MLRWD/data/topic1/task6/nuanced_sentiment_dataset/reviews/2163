I am not going to compare this to Bond, as everyone else has picked up the similarity. What i will say, is some action films are so well crafted that even though after wards you will sit back and think wow, now that was ridiculous, whilst watching it you can lose yourself in the action. Unfortunately, xXx does not fit into this category. i exchanged incredulous chuckles with the stranger sitting next to me in the cinema at the sheer overblown action, which in no way convinces you of any realism involved. I dont know what decides whether an action film lives up to this particular benchmark of success, but several factors contributed to xXxs failure. One the stereotyped and cliched 'baddie' characters left no doubt as to who would die a dramatic death in a stunning climax. The initial attempted chemistry between Xander and WhatsHerFace left no real doubt as to who would suddenly change sides. Unfortunately the wooden acting of Diesel did little to help matters, and where he was not grunting in monosyllables, he was attempting (and failing) witty comments. A fence post has more entertainment value than this actor.
Anyway thats my review and my reasons for disliking it. Maybe it is me-as i do fit the MTV 18-25 category who i assume this film is aimed at. Maybe if i were female i would be bowled over be Diesels good looks, but i can only be thankful that i am not. To conclude, ill ignore my initial statement. This film lacks the believability, wit, fast paced action and character development of Bond films. although you always know bond will save the day, the plot of said films tends not to be signposted quite as obviously. That said, ill have to wait and see how Die Another Day compares.
