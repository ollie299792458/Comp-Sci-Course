3:10 to Yuma is a terrific remake of a classic American western. Christian Bale (great as always) is Dan, a pathetic rancher who, in desperate need of money, enlists in a posse to escort ruthless train robber Ben Wade (Russell Crowe, also turning in a noteworthy performance) to a town aptly called Contention and put him aboard the 3:10 train headed for Yuma prison. As their party endures losses of life and courage, Dan receives greater and greater incentive to abandon the mission. Like a lot of great American Westerns, the story here deals pretty directly with ideals like Honor, Justice, and Loyalty. But make no mistake, this is a modern movie; the action is fast-paced and exciting, the violence is realistic, and the production values are top-notch.

The picture quality on the Blu-Ray is phenomenal, although that mostly means you'll want to put an ice pack on Christian Bale's face. He gets a pretty nasty bruise on his cheek that, sick as it may sound, really shows off the life-like picture Blu-ray is capable of producing. It's not all about the bruises, though; there are some truly picturesque desert landscapes on display as well.

As for special features, I was surprised to find this disc pretty packed with content. In addition to all the features from the standard DVD edition, the blu-ray also has some exclusives: short pieces on the film's score and the guns used in it, a conversation with Elmore Leonard, who wrote the original short story that both film adaptations are based on, and a longer (and pretty good!) feature about the impact of the railroad on the American west. All told, there's about an hour of special features, plus an insightful director commentary.

If you like westerns at all, then you owe it to yourself to check out 3:10 to Yuma. It's the most traditional of the recent western mini-boom. Even if you don't particularly care for westerns, it's a pretty darn good movie on its own merits.
