I only watched this movie because it was supposed to take place in West Virginia. The first thing I noticed was that it was not West Virginia. I have lived here my entire life and have been all over the state and I did not recognize it. Then, the State Park they visited does not even exist. Come on! If you are going to make a movie about West Virginia, at least use a real State Park! But that would have been impossible because I found that they filmed this in Romania!

The mention that Charleston (the state capitol) smelled like feet was a stretch too. Yes, the chemical plants in surrounding towns do smell like feet at times but the actual city of Charleston does not. It is like any city in any state in fact.

My other huge problem with this movie was that the evil hillbillies are portrayed as Christians. A true child of Jesus Christ, a Christian, would never do the things these people did in this movie! This is a horrible testimony of what Jesus Christ is like and what his followers are like. There are people who are absolutely nuts like these people who claim to hear Jesus telling them to do things but I don't think this movie was very clear in differentiating that fact. And for that, shame on those that made this awful movie!

The quality of this low-grade movie was actually a step above the rest of this type but the content was just too annoying and too incorrect for me. And the fact that almost every movie about West Virginia makes us all look like hillbillies gets old too. Anybody who has that opinion should visit Charleston and they will see that we are just like people in any other city and most of us do not have a southern accent to go along with it!

I do not recommend this movie unless you are braindead and then I still wouldn't recommend it!
