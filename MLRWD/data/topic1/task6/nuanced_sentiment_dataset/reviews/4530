An uneven movie, Sarah's Key starts out with the wrenching deportation of three members of a family. The younger child, a boy, is hidden in a closet by his sister, who carries the key with her. That is the key of the title. Without giving away what happens, all I can say is the first half of the movie is well made and emotionally stirring -- it's a Holocaust story and the movie has a great cast. Unfortunately, the main character, a journalist, is less and less believable and likable as the movie progresses. There are some completely unnecessary scenes in which she is looking for lost family members but not finding them -- why are we looking at perfect strangers opening their doors and shaking their heads? Couldn't the director think of anything else to fill out the story with? It goes downhill from there -- the last third of the movie is poorly written, poorly directed and poorly acted. It's tempting to give it a high rating because of the power of the subject matter, many Jewish families were destroyed by the Nazis and some children were rescued by brave, kind souls, but the movie doesn't live up to its promise.
