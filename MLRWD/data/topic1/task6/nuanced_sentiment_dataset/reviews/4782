Spoiler Warning: Like Elle's pink wedding dress, this movie just seems wrong on so many levels. It's sad, actually, because the idea of a sequel to Legally Blonde could have been fantastic fun, and this movie tries to shine like the original, but it really misses the mark.

 The entire tone is set with the opening credits. A sweeping orchestration underscores the political theme that the movie will take, and there's such a lack of fun in it that it hits you in your gut, and you just know that this is not going to be the same fun ride we had in the first film. The funny characters are still there, but there's a sense throughout the movie that all of the actors know that the film is not as good as the first, so there's a sense of "forced fun" to this sequel, like everyone is trying too hard. And poor Elle is pretty much a rehashed version of herself. Whereas in the first film, she evolved and still remained true to herself, she seems to be at Square 1 in this sequel. And I can understand the path the filmmakers were trying to take - we all have to start over at various points in our lives, but for some reason, this storyline was unable to make that idea completely work.

 I didn't hate this film. The fashions were fun and there were some decent moments, but overall, I left the film feeling disappointed.
