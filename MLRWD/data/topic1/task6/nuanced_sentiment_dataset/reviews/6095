I tried watching this movie last night with the hope that it would be good. Boy, was I wrong! An hour into it and it was off. The only vampire to fear is the one who took Stephen King's brilliant novel, sucked all the life out of it, and stuck the corpse on TV. I don't know the guy's name who adapted Salem's Lot for this stinkbomb, but he completely messed up what could've been really good. Not even talented actors like Donald Sutherland and James Cromwell could rescue this steamy turd of a film. Every character from the book is completely different in the movie, and not one of them is likable. Even Mark Petrie, who is the one person in the book you're suppose to sympathize with the most, is made into a snot-nosed punk kid. Who cares what happens to him?! And what's with all the blatant modern references like sending emails and Straker being kicked out of the country for selling ecstacy (what?!). Stuff like that will only make this movie seemed dated in a few years. If you haven't seen it yet, I suggest watching the far superior 1979 version staring David Soul and James Mason. It's a much better film, more truthful to the original story, and most importantly, it's actually creepy, which is something this vile remake never achieves. Even better, read the book or listen to the unabridged audio book.
