I am a big Jim Henson fan and have always heard about an almost fanatical devotion to this Christmas special by other fans, although after viewing it I think it is primarily a nostalgic experience for most.  The special has an awkward pacing with some songs seemingly only in existence to lengthen the show.  Other songs, such as the Nightmare River Bottom Band are way too long and out of place and style with the rest of the special.

The highlights to me were the miniature scale special effects employed by the Henson crew, although a particular scene involving the use of marionettes seemed brazenly amateur.

The final song (a medley style song) is not 'jug band like' at all, and actually felt forced to me.  The only truly fun song (and the one that stayed in my mind afterwards) was the first (and really only ) jug band song in the special, Soul BBQ.

This is a cute special and I do not regret purchasing it, although it is obviously one of the earlier shows they attempted.  Without the rosey glasses of nostalgia to color my opinion, I would have to only recommend this to fans of the original and collectors.  For a great family Christmas special the Muppet Family Christmas is still the most well rounded, funny, and heart warming show available from the Henson group.
