Well, it is like a stage play; or, I guess it -was- a stage play.  Okay, but not my favorite. I kept expecting someone to go off to war.

Damian does a very good job with his part, and Ryan Kelly is good,of course. The rest are okay too, except a bit awkward at times. These guys are singers, and darned good ones! I say let them sing.

The fact is, I like them so much, I would probably get anything with them in it, -to a point.  Ha! I give them credit for being good sports. Hmmm. Whose idea was this anyhow? If you must do it, maybe a bit more experience will help.

In any event, I will watch it again; glad I have it; otherwise I would wonder why I did not. Not really excited about the girls twisting and flitting about either. (Memories of High School plays.) Sometimes it fits to have a girl in one of the songs, but sometimes it seems like, "Let's try this." Of course, in this one, girls were necessary, but...

This is a sorry review, because I find myself struggling for words.
