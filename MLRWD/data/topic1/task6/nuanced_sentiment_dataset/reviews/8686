DiG! is about everything you want from a documentary. The fact that I was watching raw footage of two bands I actually care about that aren't huge arena-style bands, captivated me.

This documentary had me focussing on Anton Newcombe's genius and self-destructive persona.  Don't get me wrong - I love the Dandies, but throughout the years, they have gotten their camera time and really tried looking for it as well.  Anton's comment about how the Beatles are for sale (album reference), and he's just giving it away puts the whole movie into perspective.  He takes a Bill Hicks approach to being famous.  He'll do it on his terms and not sell out for it.  His critical discomfort with Courtney Taylor was pretty touching, complimenting, yet uncomfortable.  They are in two different worlds and it shows here.  Courtney & Co. are pop culture enthusiasts, always have been.  Anton is obviously stuck in a warp of 60's induced debachery - the formula of being in rock n roll.  The only thing is he does what he does second nature and not for the rock n roll lifestyle.

I don't want to give a whole lot away like many of the other reviewers.  If you like music documentaries, this is one honest moment after another caught on video and edited in a professional sequence.  Ten stars.
