As for the movie, I love it!  I think it's one of Arnold's most entertaining films.  Another plus about this dvd release is the use of 2.35 aspect ratio.  Now for the bad news, the people at Fox pictures apparently didn't care enough about this release to clean the film before they burned it to dvd, which is obvious while watching it.  It has those annoying dust specs, that you many times see while watching movies in the theaters.  I literally own two hundred dvds and I've never seen such an enormous amounts of these specs that it actually distracted me from the movie, but that is truly the case here.

I am currently looking for an older dvd release of this movie that maintains the same ratio, but doesn't have the dust specs.  It may sound like I'm being too picky, but trust me when I say that they grow annoying and a person shouldn't have put up with them after paying for a brand new dvd.  I give the movie a rating of 5 stars, but lower my rating because of Fox Movies poor workmanship.

By the way, the visual problems aren't limited to annoying dust specs.  In addition I noticed a scene in this film where this white blob (about the diameter of two of my thumbs together) appear on the screen next to Arnold Schwarzenegger's head during the film for about one half second.  I'm 90% confident that these errors are present throughout the film, but became annoyed enough not to watch the movie all the way through.  I'm considering writing a complaint to Fox Movies, and I suggest that all you fans of the genre do the same.
