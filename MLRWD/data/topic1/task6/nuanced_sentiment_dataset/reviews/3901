In 1964 I might have given this five stars. I was a liberal then before I grew up. Viewing the film this afternoon on the Turner Movie Classics I was struck at how slanted the film was for the year it came out.  Much more so than the book it was based on.  That was the year people in both parties were upset over Barry Goldwater and at the same time not in love with LBJ.  The film doesn't identify party, but it does push a liberal agenda.  Proper in areas like Civil Rights, but very much full or stereotypes of people on the right and left.  It is almost as though the producers, directors and actors feel the pain over losing Kennedy and want an Adlai Stevenson type with a bit of Kennedy in him.  The Kennedy looking candidate is the bad guy in more ways than one and the whole story centers around the back room activities at a national convention.  Having been to a couple national conventions (one Democrat and one Republican) and many state and local conventions I found that part very good.  It is worth seeing the film to look at a period in history when conventions were more important in the nomination process.  This coming election we have the possibility of primaries selecting candidates for both parties months before the conventions.  While that seems more democratic than holding national conventions, finance laws have made this a rich man's race for both parties.  I have no problem with the primary system, however the way it is run now is ridiculous.  Also  running the election period for four years, this current one began December of 2004, is equally ridiculous.  It could be that in 2009 we'll look back to this film and think maybe what went on wasn't so bad afterall.  We're seeing worse right now and it is July 2007 as I write this.
