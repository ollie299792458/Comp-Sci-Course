Everybody I know has raved about what a great movie this is so I went and wasted [...] bucks at my local cinema to to see it for myself.This movie is set in the God forsaken backwater of Afghanistan where all the guys seem to be confused about their sexual identity cos they all walk around wearing robes and stoning women of loose moral character.I guess Women's Sexual Fredom is still an unkown concept in that part of the world . I kind of feel sorry for the American Troops over there who have to put up with living in such a backwater. So then we have two boys named Hassan and Amir. One is a rich spoiled kid and the other is a peasant. Bad things often happen to poor  people  and this movie is no exception. Poor little Hassan gets raped by this bully who  is either a child molester or a homsoexual or both. Then  Amir runs away  instead of defending him. What are good friends for may I ask? Then Amir can't stand to be around Hassan anymore because he is a constant  reminder  of what a  coward  he really is. Then the movie turns into some sort of existential common man search for meaning, salvation and redemption and Hassan is living in America by that  time and  goes back to his crappy homeland for forgiveness or God knows what.By this point of the movie I couldn't care less. Then  he tries to adopt a kid and gets  beaten up which he enjoys cos it makes him feel better. This part of the movie only makes sense of you can understand the concept of guilt riden masochism . Then by golly gee it all works out for Amir in the end and he gets to fly his kite with some local kids. Afghanistan is a  God forwesaken backwater and when I pay good money to  see a movie I at least expect some nice scenery and a few good looking women in it instead of  this  junk
