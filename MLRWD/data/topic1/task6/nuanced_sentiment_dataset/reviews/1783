I had expected so much more from this film.  There were two interwoven stories that at times were very difficult to follow.  I think a stronger narrative would have helped tie things together.
The story of the Scot who wouldn't race on the Sabbath was well acted but the woman who played his girlfriend was dreary. It was refreshing to see a Protestant hero that wasn't presented as a hypocrite. 
The other story of Abrahams was not well thought out.  I kept waiting to hear more about his motivations.  It must have been difficult to be Jewish in an ultra WASPY British Private School but the movie left too much out....
The story line was very hard to follow and even boring at times.
Filming was washed out.  The slow motion scenes were awful.

Very similar to many Masterpiece Theater productions but not as well produced, acted or as sophisticated.  I thought the intro at the college where different students tried to get freshmen to join their clubs was incredibly corny.
I can't believe this was picture of the year!
