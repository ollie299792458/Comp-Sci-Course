At first the movie seem to be good, Sarah Michelle Gellar in the role of Catherine is great, she's a very good actress.  The movie seem to me a bit too much, like the actors performence was in the line to be too much but at first it was okay, it was kind of weird, funny let say cynical but it could had been a good movie.  It gets worst when Sebastian change, he had change way too fast, it was way too clich&eacute; and after that the movie was too weird and ridiculous.Come on Sebastian had change overnight that impossible to change so fast, fall in love almost right aways with the goody goody, sweet and smart Annette seem so not real.Sebastian get on my nerves lots of time, the actor give a good performance but sometime it was way too much.  Also Annette gets on my nerves for being so goody smart and fall in love so fast with Sebastian that was stupid.  And the one who get on my nerves the most was C&eacute;cile, I could not tolerate her and sometime Catherine also gets on my nerves.I don't say it's a bad movie but it could had been way better.  It was too weird, everything went to fast that make it so unbelievable and the end was so stupid, that movie doesn't make any sence.  I think it was just a very cynical movie so it was met to be that way!
