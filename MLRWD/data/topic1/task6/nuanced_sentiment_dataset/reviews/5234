At present, the only thing i could think of that would be unfunnier than this sorry excuse for a comedy is that Jack Nicholson has reduced himself to this. If it weren't for his past we'd be talking guaranteed career suicide, Hugh Grant style.
"Anger management" is actually incredibly accurate in its title, as any viewer with a functioning cerebrum will testify: if you (for whatever reason) do sit through this film you will definately not get up in a calm mood. If you paid to see it you will need some money management therapy too. And if you rented it throw in some time management for desert.
  Dont worry, no spoilers ahead, because there's no need to go over the plot for such a waste of celluloid.
  I'll keep it to the extreme basics here: a totally silly, seriously unfunny film, with Nicholson playing the shrink of a guy who needs anger management. The plot could have easily been written by a 1000 monkeys typing away randomly at typewriters.
  There is (i hear) an attempt at humor in this film. If this holds true (i didnt discover any such success in it) then i must be totally lacking at humor. But hey, what do i know, i thought "A fish called Wanda" was funny, but obviously there must be a new frequency of humor around that I'm not catching on to.
  Avoid it is if there's no tomorrow.
  Give it as birthday present to someone you genuingly dislike.
  Make an activist-group against unfunny films purporting to be comedies.
  Write a letter to your local congreesman and complain.
  Do something.
  But do not waste your valuable remaining time from what's stolen from you every day on this.
