Long before the American remake came out, I watched the Korean "A Tale of Two Sisters". Not only was that amazing, it became one of my favorite films of all time. Now, of course, as soon as I heard of the remake, I had doubts. Usually Hollywood really screws up Asian horror but I tried to be positive.

So I'm watching the movie... so far so good. A couple of scenes they kept faithful to the original which, as a fan, I was very appreciative. The music score was really, really pretty. I loved it. Also, LOVE the sister (named Rachel, I believe). The actress that played her did an amazing job and gave her lines great personality.

And then it all goes a bit down from there. Many of the "scary" lines were laughable. I mean, did they really try to make those scary or were they kidding? Picture this:

There's a ghost girl crawling out from beneath the sink. She's cover in blood and slime. Her hair is soaking and dragging on the floor. She tilts her head to look up at you. You back away as fast as you can. Unfortunately, there's a cabinet behind you, but you wouldn't DARE look away. You want to know when to dodge the creepy girl. The girl looks up at you and then growls, "You're next." Huh? I'm sorry, can you say that again? "I'm next?" Is that the best you could come up with? That's not scary at all! The scene is instantly lost and I'm reminded that it's a Hollywood "horror" movie I'm seeing.

The twist at the end... well... it was better in the Korean one. Much better. I have a feeling a lot of people are going to see this and once they get to the American twist ending, they'll be thinking, "That's the oldest one in the book!" I know I was.

Still, it was a good movie. It was shot well, I liked the acting, it was a nice set (though some sets were clearly in a studio somewhere). Perhaps if I hadn't seen the Korean version first, this would have been a bit better. Do yourself a favor, buy "A Tale of Two Sisters" before buying this.
