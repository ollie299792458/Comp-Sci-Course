I was dating my now-husband then and saw little things here and there (including the towels) but ignored them for many reasons. My husband is a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde character and at that time, Dr. Jekyll ruled (a really terriffic person, kind-hearted, attentive, great to my dogs). But after seeing this movie, I felt the urge to move the hand towels in his bathroom and sure enough, he could not walk by in the hall, no less, without fixing them.

He was verbally abusive while being Mr. Hyde but I continued to make peace only because I had no other choice and ignored and made excuses for his verbal abuse, as many unknowing women do (we know verbal abuse escalates to physical). I became a lawyer so I could help underdogs and also have an out if it escalated and I need to escape. Now the abuse has escalated to the point of being dangerous so now I have an out. He was happy about me being an attorney to be his personal attack lawyer but extraordinarily angry for me standing up for myself, like Julia Roberts' character. So now, I have to run.
