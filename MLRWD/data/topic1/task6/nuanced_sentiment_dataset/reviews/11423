I watched the first 2 seasons of this show, as I am a fan of British comedy, mainly in the type of shows Ricky Gervais has done, but I also watched many before he came along. When watching the first episode, all I could think about was that this was exactly the type of sitcom Gervais was making fun of with his "when the whistle blows" show within a show of the Extras. It so closely resembled that satire that it was not that funny, and the laugh track was annoying and insulting. The running gag of "did you turn it off and on again" wears thin very quickly. The female manager's foghorn angry voice is not funny-being the loudest doesn't make what you say any more clever. I wanted to give it more of a chance than making a judgement after 23 minutes, so I watched the rest of the first 2 seasons. By the third or fourth show of the first season it was getting much better, and by season 2 I found myself laughing out loud quite a few times during each show. Like most shows, it seems to take a while for the actors to get comfortable in their characters and add some depth to them. They did drop some things that didn't work that well in season 1, like the over the top cartoonish boss and the squalor of their office. And the Goth in the closet was toned down a bit as well. If you can get through the first couple of episodes you'll find that this grows on you quickly and is hilarious.
