I agree very much with "art87's" review... I got this as a x-mas gift b/c it looked like a real "must have" from the promotional ads.  I don't know who edited this but it's so poorly put together!  There's 3 CDs but part of the speeches and live performances are all chopped up on different CDs, all the speeches are cut really short, (like Bruce Springsteen inducting U2) and it's extremely disorganized!  It should've been put together in date order, with all the speeches and songs for the band being inducted on the same CD and not butchered and put all over the place.  What's up with the different names of the CDs, what's the point of that?  They could've just gone in order and called each CD "1,2 & 3."  And what's the point of even having the speeches on the CDs if you can't show each speech as it was done live?  I don't know if this is a Time Life error or an error by the editors of Rolling Stone, but I have to ask... what were you thinking when you edited what could've been a really great bunch of events to see???  BEWARE OF BUYING THIS!
