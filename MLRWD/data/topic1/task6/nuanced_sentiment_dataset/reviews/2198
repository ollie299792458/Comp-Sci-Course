Why the movie matters:  This well-known Bible story is being told by Hollywood, but in animation.  This way, it has more of an effect on kids, but some adult humor in places. The cast: Val Kilmer, Sandra Bullock,  Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum. The story being told:  I've known the  story of Moses for as long as I can remember.  This retelling of how Moses  and his brother Rameses, the Prince of Egypt, how driven apart by their  beliefs and true heritages.  Moses leaves Egypt, and his past, to join his  real family--the Hebrews.  When the burning bush in a cave starts talking,  Moses starts walking, and right back to Egypt to free his people. The story  behind the story:  Well, I've read Exodus, and I've been read to from  Exodus, and I know this story pretty well.  Although before the opening  credits said Historical and Artistical Liscenses existed for the film, I  was dissapointed.  There were essential parts taken out to "better portray  the story."  In a world where technology rules, I don't think these things  should have been turned around.  Kids will learn one of the most famous  stories wrong.  All in all, directors Brenda Chapman, Simon Wells (Balto),  and Steve Hickner did an overall well job. Release Date:  VHS and DVD  copies are now available at nearly every store selling such equipment. The  Outlook:  The movie did well in the theatre, it should do equally well on  video release.  Especially with the hit song Miracles from sensations  Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston.
