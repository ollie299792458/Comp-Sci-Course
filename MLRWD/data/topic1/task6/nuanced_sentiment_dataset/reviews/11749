First of all, wannabe critics, the movie Spun has nothing to do with Los Angeles or California.  In fact, it is never mentioned in the movie where the story takes place.  However, if you had done any research before you wrote your review, you would know that Will De Los Santos wrote the story about experiences from his matriculation at the University of Oregon.  During the movie there are at least 2 references to this fact: 1) Jason Swartzman wears an U of O letterman's jacket (suitably w/o the varsity letter) as his costume  2) The strip club "Jiggles," a wholesome Oregon mini-chain for "Harmless visual stimuli", mentioned twice in the film, used to be right on W. 11th behind the Pak 'n' Save.  Withholding that the Eugene/Springfield area produces more meth-amphetamine than PA,NY, and NJ combined, only if you were out crack-shopping or soliciting hookers would you recognize Circus Liquors as being part of N. hollywood and think this an LA tale.

  Now, as for the movie... when you think of it as a little Eugene addict's diary on film its kinda cute, and would have been entertaining if De Los Santos had made the movie himself (he tried and failed in Morocco).  With MTV's Ackerman directing, the project turned into a quirky music video with the kind of tongue-in-cheek displayed in "Smack My Bitch Up", sheltering the audience from the truly sordid lifestyle of the addict.  This is a portrait of a young man's life unravelling, and shouldn't be as forgiving or comic as it is.  This depiction robs its veiwers of the very real situations that drown addicts in a nightmare collapse of tenuously placed dominos that is the structure of their lives.  The past, the present and future collide vacuously in an addicts mind, their lives and relationships futilely become based on nothing but the drug.  Watching this movie will make you laugh at drug addicts, and will never give you real insight into what being an out-of-control, scattered, drug-addled tweaker really is!
