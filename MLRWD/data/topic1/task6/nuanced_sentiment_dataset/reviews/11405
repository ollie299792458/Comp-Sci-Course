It is very painful to watch ONLY 15 MINUTES FROM THE HISTORIC CONCERT AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN AND AN INTERRUPTED PERFORMANCE OF "SOMEBODY TO LOVE" WITH JUSTIN AND USHER. Director Chu said he had 9 hours of film footage of this gifted teenager, yet this DVD is only 1 hour and 45 minutes long.I have "Titanic" and "Avatar" each on a single DVD and each one is over 3 hours long.and a 3 disc special edition with all 9 hours is definitely called for, at an affordable price, like the 3 disc special edition of "Avatar" since talent like this only comes around once in a lifetime.For an hour and a half, this excellent documentary shows Justins parents, friends, and fans with numerous video clips from his childhood, many of which have already appeared on YouTube however.Also are short clips from numerous breathtaking concerts, but with only brief moments from such immortal hits as:"Love Me", "Bigger", Eenie Meenie", "Runaway Love", and " One Time".The only complete performances here are: "One Less Lonely Girl", "Never Let You Go", "Overboard", "Never Say Never", "Down to Earth", "Favorite Girl" (special feature) and "Baby", and an almost complete "U Smile". It is extremely painful to watch only a little bit of some of these riveting performances, and  on a DVD this supremely gifted teenager deserves better than he is getting here.Justins manager Scooter Braun has done wonders for him, much more than his father ever did, but maybe its time to also hook up with Jane Carter of Spectra Management since she gave us the magnificent Aaron Carter DVD's (3).This review is intended for those that know the difference between a 9hr. 3 DVD special edition, as opposed to a one hr. 45 min.sample of today's most gifted musical phenomenon.
