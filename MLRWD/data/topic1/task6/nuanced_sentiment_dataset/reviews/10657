As a person who is married to a Chinese, visited Beijing twice, and have seen mostly excellent Chinese films in the limited selection of non-Hong-Kong stuff available on DVD, this was a shock for us.  The first few minutes of the film are passable, introducing the main characters, and providing a few nice glimpses of Beijing as lived by poor migrants versus (apparently) richer folk.  After this, things go downhill fast. A good summary: a bicycle is stolen back and forth, and there's an escalating series of fights.  By the last hour, the movie is reduced to gang fights and various people hitting each other with bricks and rocks.  Nothing of any consequence really happens in the last hour; there's no character development, no romantic development (despite some hope of this early on) beyond truly high-school-movie-level stuff, and you just want this thing to be OVER!
So, do yourself a favor.  There's great Chinese films out there..."Shower" is a truly brilliant and poignant film of modern Chinese life, check out "The Road Home" for a different, rural look back.  Even going to Panda Express is better than this.  Or, if you even wanna see well-done versions of people beating on each other, get "The Warriors" or "Scarface" or something.  This is a major disappointment (though I might've give it 2 stars if not for the excessive length).
