Ok. Do you want more Transformers G1 post-movie? Yeah well then get this. However before you watch it here are some important facts. 1: Music is not good. I wish it had the classic background music. All it has is the little sound clip from when then autobot/decipticon symbols switch during scene transitions. The music is way too repetitive and not a lot of variety so it's gets old fast. 2:**spoiler** the main man dies again in the beginning episodes and hot rod gets promoted to you-know-who again... 3:Animation is what you might expect from a fourth season with a smaller budget, again lots of repetition not alot of originality. 4: Springer. If you liked him well, he's got a minor part. He's now referred to as one of the "triple changers". The Headmasters are different then in the miniseries at the end of G1 season 3. Finally, the good news. Subtitles are VERY well done, using the American series names and references. In all honestly, that's the sole reason to watch this. And the transformation sounds and weapon sound effects are the same also. It's a long series, and there is way too much narration in place of actual visual story building. But it's more classic transformers so whoo hoo!
