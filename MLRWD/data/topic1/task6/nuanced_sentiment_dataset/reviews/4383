With a very shocking and plot twisting HalloweeN 4 ending.  The producer of HalloweeN 4 seeing that the movie was #1 for two weeks at the box office decided to make a sequal to 4.  The Revenge Of Micheal Myers sounds good until you notice this is not the same Myers from 4.  Note the mask difference as soon as he escapes the mine explosion.  With the last Micheal Myers being small in stature (using hockey equipment to look buff up).  They hired a actor who not only taller but is a stunt man.  The mask is too long. Most of all why on earth would you kill off Rachel so easily?  I mean how many people who are smart in horror films ending up getting killed?  Her death was too early in the film to begin with.  Once again Danielle Harris does a great job renewing her role as Jamie.  Her acting is well scripted with the "luandry chute* scene she did it herself.  Shows how devoted she was to her role.  When HalloweeN 9 or 1 comes later this year once again Danielle will be in HalloweeN.  The mysterious guy in boots was never answered until it was confirmed the actor who played who also did Myers in this film had no idea why.  Overall the movie was good to watch until they killed Rachel and the finale with a echoing Harries yelling "no" with a disappointing HalloweeN 6 to followed.  Evil never dies is what I see from Micheal Myers no matter what people do he will be back in one way or another.
