This movie is one that I am glad to have seen, but I did not like it. Besides the fact that it was poorly done by modern technological standards, I feel that some things were inaccurate. The film made me angry. Because of this, I have not yet sorted out my feelings about the film completely, and therefore cannot produce a coherent paper as a review of it. This &#8220;review&#8221; will be more like a journey through my mind as I watched the movie.
 The first thing I noticed was the Chinese broadcast over the loudspeaker to the GI&#8217;s. This was portrayed accurately, as described in The Last Parallel by Martin Russ. The film also gave a good view of the equipment used in Korea (trucks, helmets, grenades, guns, tripods, concertina wire, uniforms, radios, canteens, etc.). The film also showed the slight integration of the army at the time of this battle (1953). Mortar explosions were also accurate (hitting the ground and then detonating and kicking up the earth). The man on the loudspeaker also knew the name of the company and where they were, which was mentioned in The last Parallel.
 I wonder if a 3-D topographical map of Pork Chop was available to the officers as was shown. It seemed a bit unrealistic. Also, the Lt., during the attack, said, &#8220;The men aren&#8217;t firing! Make them use their weapons!&#8221; This was interesting. Men fighting for their lives would have fired, you betcha! I guess that&#8217;s what you get in a film based on a book by S.L.A. Marshall. The Lt. Even tells one man, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a rifle! Use it!&#8221; Soldiers were shown laying without firing and rarely had their guns in the &#8220;prone&#8221; position.
 The men were portrayed as uneasy and highly disorganized. While there is probably some truth in this, it made me uneasy. I&#8217;m sure it could not have been as bad as it was portrayed, though I know times were desperate. Throughout the movie, there was never a cry for a medic. Was there no medic sent to the hill? I think not. Also, a runner forgot his message. Is that typical?
 When the men in the trenches were hit by artillery, they were quick to think they were hit by friendly fire. This shows a bit of resentment that did not sit well with me. It was another element that added to the total confusion I felt throughout the film.
 The film also showed a lot of pseudo-comedy. This was probably the case, as men were always trying to keep themselves in &#8220;high&#8221; spirits. Still, the men were portrayed as listening intently to the messages over the loudspeaker. According to Russ, the men either ignored the announcements, or just made fun of them.
 The movie also showed the rear echelon as without a clue. Though this is mostly true, this movie showed the rear as ignorant as well as cruel. Does protocol really take precedence over life? Still, I felt like I could see things from the side of the rear and the side of the infantry. Mostly, though, I got the feeling that the audience was supposed to see that both sides were betraying the GI&#8217;s.
 The thing that made me the angriest was the &#8220;peace negotiation.&#8221; The talks were heated, yes, but not nearly as desperate as the situation on Pork Chop. Why not send every available man up there to help? I mean, if it&#8217;s what you want, you have to really fight for it, and 25 men will not do the trick. I mean, while the &#8220;higher ups&#8221; are safe in the confines of heated buildings and in diplomacy forums, there are men being killed while fighting this war.
 At the end the Lt. said, &#8220;Pork Chop Hill was hell.&#8221; This is the best description of the fighting on the hill and of the movie that I could ever hope to hear. The movie was not awful, but things about it made me mad. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like to get passionate about films; I just don&#8217;t want to get so mad I get a headache from the frustration!
