This is a re-make of the 1970's disaster film The Poseidon Adventure by blockbuster-director Wolfgang Petersen of Troy and The Perfect Storm fame. Passengers of the titanic cruise ship Poseidon, found themselves in survival mode after a runaway tidal wave hits and capsizes their vessel. Their only way to survive is go to the base part of the liner, which is now at the top. Unlike the Academy Award-winning blockbuster, Titanic (a romantic-drama set in a cataclysmic situation), this movie is an action-adventure journey for the characters to make their way to the top of the ship.

30 years ago, effects in disaster films were done mechanically. Today, with the advent of computer-generated images and a high-budget cost of production, disaster films are made much more thrilling and much more shocking to its viewers, for which reason this re-make is justifiable. The impact of the original Poseidon however, was not in its adventure and realistic shocking effects but rather in its depiction of primal fear and the instinct to survive. The original succeeded due to the superb dynamic characterization brought to life by the exceptional talents of its actors notably, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. This re-make fails to sustain the intensity of the original for it lacks the portrayal of humanity in its most primal state. This new version rather portrayed one-dimensional static characters with one goal in mind--to survive. In other words, this movie is just an adventure-filled voyage to survival.

Watching the film won't bore its viewers though. It is a 105-minute adrenaline-pumping ride of entertainment, akin to the trend of a summer blockbuster. Again, watch it if you want some dose of adrenaline rush and excitement in your viewing pleasure.
