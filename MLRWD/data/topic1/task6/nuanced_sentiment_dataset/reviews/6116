As a 20-something guy, it's totally a guilty pleasure watching the first two Shreks: They may be "kid" flicks, but 1 & 2 are absolutely brilliant in critiquing Disney films.  I also love how much off-color humor is slipped past the little ones.  Shrek 1 and 2 also speak to some profound life-truths (if you can see past the fart jokes).  In stark contrast, this third attempt is a total train wreck in every conceivable way and is totally devoid of the soul which made the others so wonderful.

A prime example of where they went off the tracks is a scene where Princess Fiona watches her father die.  Any normal person would know that's a topic that can't be made funny and should be treated in a gentle/ respectful fashion. But not here: they tried to crack jokes as the king is gasping for breath . . .  I just cringed. That single scene was so awful, it basically destroyed the rest of the movie for me.

Shrek 3 was literally devoid of humor and I never had one good "belly laugh" (i.e. Pinocchio's underwear scene from Shrek 2).  Also, in the first two, there were some touching scenes of character development and heartwarming vulnerability.  Here, that was abandoned and everyone just went through the motions.

This film is a disaster: don't waste your money or time on even a rental.
