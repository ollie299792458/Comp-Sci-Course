The true lie beneath this movie is that it's a suspenseful and/or thrilling movie. I hope that Ford and Pfeiffer are regretting the day they agreed to act in this one. The suspense consists of Pfeiffer lurking around with a half-demented look on her face. Thrilling consists of hackneyed big knife scenes, scenes with the bad guy crawling into the back window of the truck, and a car sinking into the lake with people in it. All of these have been done before and done much better. You sit and wait for the "something" to happen, and wait and wait and wait and wait . . . . . . By the end of the movie you're just waiting for it to end and waiting and waiting and waiting and well you get the picture. Or rather, don't get the picture. It's boring, badly acted, and the plot seems to not know its direction. At first, you think something's wrong at the neighbors. Pfeiffer spends way too much time lurking. Then, you think maybe it's her problem and has something to do with the auto accident, or is it empty nest syndrome? Or is the nest really empty? They mention a daughter that as far as I could tell had nothing to do with the plot. And then we find, no, hubby's the bad guy and he had an affair. Now he wants to cover up. And now we can start the real movie after we've wasted an hour or so on this other crud. Of course the real movie was nothing to spend your time watching. My husband was truly annoyed by the movie. I was just bored.
