Well, I say Blu-ray "transfer" rather than Blu-ray "master" because I do not believe this is a high-definition master. The picture quality is atrocious, with cheap edge enhancement applied to the image in order to try to achieve a sharper image without paying for a proper HD master. Some SD masters look fine when upscaled on a good TV, but this supposed HD image actually looks vastly inferior to decent DVDs. If you like/love this film, as I do, then stick to your DVD of it. If you don't have it, either get the DVD or wait until the Blu-ray is reissued in a newer edition. To call this high definition is an insult to the format and even more so to viewers like us whom the manufacturers seem to believe will buy anything they sell. I love this film and believe it deserves a lot more respect and special features like deleted scenes. Save your money. This review is concerning the British blu ray that came out Aug of 2008. Haven't seen the quality of the US release coming out Aug 3 2010.

Received the new version 8-7-210. First the good news. The picture quality has been greatly improved. Almost too much. Watching the new edition it was clear that the Air Force One shot was a plastic model. The sound track blows the speakers out and is beautiful. If all you want is the movie, this will make you happy. Now the bad news. It has none, absolutely nada, special features besides the movie trailer. For $19 I would rather they gave the special features and threw away the DVD edition of the film, which I didn't need anyway. So if you have one of the DVD editions with the special features you can order this blu ray for the picture quality upgrade, throw away the included DVD and replace it with your older one with the special features. As for me, this is the last time I'm buying this movie. I'm still disappointed, but not as much.
