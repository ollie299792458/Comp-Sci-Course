A beautiful transfer. Well lit. Colors gorgeous. Costumes apropos. One minor complaint. Since this was filmed circa 1962 it is a little grainy, but that is not overly obtrusive. A Opera Buffa about a Loud Lewd Randy Lout of an overly self satisfied Cheapskate money-less Rou&eacute; Baron.  Count Rofrano who is a seventeen year old "boy" (sang by a thirtiesh woman). His Lover, an aging Princess. His new love sang by a girl (thirtiesh woman) just out of a convent. (A common practice of educating girls). He presents a silver rose to the girl in Baron's Ochs name. She and Count fall in love at first sight.(?) But Baron Ochs and convent girl were betrothed sight unseen. When she sees him she is appalled. Not him surely?  She can't stand the Baron. Count and Baron duel for her affections and Baron Ochs is injured. Then the buffoonery sets in full force. Baron Ochs (Ox?) eventually is told to get the hell out. Count and Princess part amicably, and the Girl and Count claim each other and fade into eternity. It take three hours to tell the tale. Time is only relative is it not? I like this Opera. It is a real Opera, not just sang for cameras on a sound stage.
