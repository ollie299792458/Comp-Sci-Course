This is truely "THE" definitive Bond movie ever produced thus far.  
Sean Connery, truly the only actor to ever emulate every aspect of the James Bond persona, gives a effortless performance as the master spy James Bond.  Connery's ease to go from wetsuit to tuxedo without blinking is a testament to the James Bond appeal and desire that is within the majority of men.  With as many men as Bond has killed, in as many different ways...none of the one liners have ever been better than "  Shocking.....Positively Shocking".  Although many have come close....they aren't as cool and crisp as Connery's delivery.
To give a brief overview on the story, the world is once again in peril and Bond is the man to save it from the clutches of Auric Goldfinger ( marvelously played by Gert Frobe ) and Pussy Galore ( Honor Blackman ).  Bond is called in to investigate the unusal movement of gold on the currency market with the only real lead being Goldfinger...
None of the other Bond movies truly are so enthralling as this one is, it is the figurehead of the series and will not be replaced in this reviewers opinion.  Although I hope we never see the end of Bond on the movie screen....Goldfinger, in my opinion, always sets the standard.
