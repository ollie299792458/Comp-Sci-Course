I purchased the Elite Squad, Blu-ray as a gift in December, and received an item that never worked. Nowhere in the order page did Amazon.com or Movie Mars indicate that the Blu-ray was not coded for use in the US. When I called to complain about this to the Amazon.com customer service department, I was told by two different customer service agents, at two different times that they too couldn't find this information on the order page, therefore I was eligible for the A-Z guarantee. After filing my A-Z claim, Amazon.com informed me that the item I ordered indicated a PAL format (Region2) DVD. This information was never displayed in the order page. The only description was: Blu-ray. Customer service from Movie Mars informed me that there was a "window" which showed this information. I argued that it's ludicrous for a company in the US sell a product to a US resident that will only work in regions such as: "Japan, Europe, South Africa and the Middle East including Egypt". Movie Mars' excuse for this was that they sell all over the world. I find it interesting that now, in bold red letters this information regarding coding is clearly seen in the order pages. This will be my last purchase with Amazon.com.
