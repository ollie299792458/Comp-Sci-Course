Kids across the country have been offended and upset by this movie.

It may be early in the year, but it's safe to say that this film will definitely take the award for Worst Film Of 2005. In fact, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in recent memory. I really wish I had that 90 minutes back to live later on. Before I get into it, let's look into the facts here. The bankable stars of The Mask, Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz, refusing to return for a sequel should be the first red light. The second if that its a sequel to a film that's over ten years old and didn't really leave the audience hanging enough to justify a second part. Finally, Jamie Kennedy is no Jim Carrey. He's not even a "poor man's" Jim Carrey.

The script, special effects, and performances weren't strong enough to carry the film and that should have been obvious to the studio bosses from the first glimpse of what they had to work with this time around. Jamie Kennedy is just creepy when he wears the mask. Even worse is that he's completely unfunny when he's not wearing it. There's actually not a truly funny moment in the film. This one is obviously geared towards the kids, but the kids in the screening I saw weren't impressed and neither were the adults. I'm amazed that this didn't go straight to video. If there's any justice in the world, it'll sink fast and no one will remember this one. Hopefully it won't taint the good memories that people had of the original. Avoid this one like the plague. It's painfully unfunny.
