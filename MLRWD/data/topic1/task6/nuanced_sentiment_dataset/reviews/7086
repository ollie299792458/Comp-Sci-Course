I was so excited to see that Pearl Jam was coming out with this DVD--mostly because I missed out on the last tour. 
If you buy this DVD, you will get to hear some some great live music and will have a huge setlist, but this is definitely not something interesting to watch. Back in the day Eddie was a showman, but not anymore. With this DVD, you basically get to see Eddie standing at a mic and singing. That's it. Combine this with relatively bland camera work and you'll get very bored very quick. Maybe it's the fact that Pearl Jam are getting older, but this performance just doesn't seem very inspired and has a very low energy level. My roomate is the biggest Pearl Jam fanatic I know---He was literally angry and wouldn't watch this. He couldn't believe the lack of showmanship and energy from the band.
There are some bright moments on this DVD--Like I said the music is fantastic as always-- I Am Mine is a beautiful song and comes across great. "You Are" sounds very cool as on the album. The classics like "Black" and "Betterman" are also great.
I would definitely recommend this for any serious fan, but the casual Pearl Jam fan will simply find this very boring. Save a few bucks and just buy a live CD... If you're looking for high octane, energized, and emotional performances(like I was and didn't find with this DVD)- look for Coldplay Live 2003 which is (tons of energy and emotion; 5 stars), and U2 Go Home; Live from Slane Castle 2001.
