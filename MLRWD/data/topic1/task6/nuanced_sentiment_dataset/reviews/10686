She knew how to make her life into a movie...

And boy, is this a movie.

What's the first thing you'll notice about I Know Who Killed Me? Looking from the cover, you'll see a rose--maybe even a face or two if you look closer. What's the thing you'll notice after that?

Lindsay Lohan...

We all know Lindsay Lohan as the little girl who played in The Parent Trap and Life Size, which co-starred Tyra Banks as a doll who comes to life. But what else do we know Lindsay as? A singer, the third friend of the Britney, Paris and Lindsay Trio, oh, and she's also been called a Bimbo of the Apocalypse. What don't people know about her?

Lindsay can actually act. She does justice in I Know Who Killed Me, which is about a girl--Aubrey--who likes to write, who likes this guy who gives her a blue rose, and then disappears, abducted by a man bent on torturing her.

When Aubrey comes back, she's not Aubrey; she's a girl named Dakota. Nothing about Dakota seems to differ from Aubrey. Dakota is Aubrey to everyone else, but Dakota is her own person to Aubrey.

So, what happens when Dakota steps in?

A mystery occurs.

I Know Who Killed Me is a movie that has little replay value. I've watched it once and probably won't watch it again. I Know Who Killed Me is a psychological thriller, but is very tame at that. While it provides for a storyline that will keep you wanting to learn more, the lack of anything memorable in the movie will probably keep you from buying it, much less watching it again.
