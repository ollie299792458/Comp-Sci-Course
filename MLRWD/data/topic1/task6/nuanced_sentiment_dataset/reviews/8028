Finally the enthralling fantasy that is Willow is released on DVD!  Now when is the Star Wars trilogy arriving??  Anyway, this is definitely one of my favorite fantasy movies of all time.  The movies Legend and Krull are also great, but don't have the enrapturing quality that all of George Lucas's movies seem to have.  The movie follows a Nelwyn farmer, Willow, that is dreaming of becoming a sorcerer.  Through a matter of fate he becomes the guardian of a baby, the one prophecied to save the world. During the film he meets Val Kilmer's character, who is reluctant but helps Willow nevertheless, and a couple of teeny-tiny rodents that provide the humor in the story.  He also finds help where he least expects in the form of a beautiful young lady, that is actually the Queen Bavmorda's daughter.  In his journey to save the babe he goes through many seriously risky situations, one that includes a mutated dragon.  
The plot line is excellent and the dialogue goes from serious to funny without breaking any seams.  The plot seems to contain some elements of the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, but it combines them well and creates a movie that stands firmly on its own.  Excellent movie recommended for fans of Tolkien, Lucas, and any fantasy adventures.  Buy it today, its a great Christmas gift. 
Now if they would only make movies out of the novel sequels...
