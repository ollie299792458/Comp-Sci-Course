First of all, I think the animation was first class.  There were no shortcuts taken and the artwork was extremely well done.  This movie is a series of short stories that are put together in a larger setting.  Although, the stories are very diverse, the authors manage to tie them together quite well.  The stories are fairly well-executed and fairly well developed. (I won't give you story by story detail since others have done that very well.)  There is an occasional miss: Mogo and Abin Sur have very thin plots.  But the main problem I have with this movie is that all of the good stories are quite banal.  You can even predict whats going to happen beforehand.  There is really no originality to them.  Also, the main story is not very well developed.  The background of the antagonist is only spoken and never shown.  His motivation is also spoken and not visualized. It's like they really didn't care about the main story at all and its only there as a vehicle to unite the other stories.  And as others have noted, the ending is rushed and predictable.  I will give three stars for the excellent artwork and the presence of Nathan Fillion, one of my favorite actors.
