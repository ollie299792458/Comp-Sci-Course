For those who are interested, "Betty Blue" is available on dvd, just not in America. There is a region 4, Australian PAL edition available. Also, there is a region 0 edition that is also PAL that I guess is around. If you like the movie, you might want to look for one of these, but be aware of the word "PAL" for both dvds.
Now, for the movie itself, of which the shorter version (121 minutes) I saw.  While I must say the opening sex scene was pretty steamy, and the acting was very well done throughout the picture, the movie really is rather unimportant.  To clarify, the story just does not lend itself to having any significance.  It is simply just a movie, not bad or anything, but nothing to get truly excited over.  Really, see this if you want to see great lighting by the director, the aforementioned sex scene, frequent nudity of the lead characters, and the occasional truly funny moment.  As for Betty's insanity, it truly does not make sense.  But I suspect this movie is more about the character of Zorg and how Betty is to him than about her, most likely as an unintended block to his ability to write again. (After all, he doesn't seem to care about her a person as much as Betty cares about him) Anyway, that's my view of things. I'll give the movie between a 2.5 to 3 out of 5.
