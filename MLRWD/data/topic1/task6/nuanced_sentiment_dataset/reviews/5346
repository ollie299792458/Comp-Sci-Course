Being an avid horror freak for nearly four decades now I wish to throw my two cents in...

I love them all! The classics (Dracula & Frankenstein) with such greats as Bela Lugosi and Boris Kaloff, the 80's slasher flicks ( A nightmare on Elm St; Friday the 13th, Halloween),  modern day throwbacks such as The devil's Rejects (which has become one of my all time favorites...Gotta love Rob Zombie!), Two thumbs up to certain remakes such as The Texas Chainsaw massacre & Halloween (Rob again!),By the way the TCM...The beginning, is another of my favorites, and last but not least the newer kidnap/torture genre such as (Saw, Hostel, Turistas).

That being said I have always held a certain special place for monsters, Vampires & Werewolves to be precise, in my heart.  Back in 1981 two legendary werewolf movies came out.  Of course I'm talking about The Howling directed by Joe Dante & Creature effects by Rob Bottin and An American Werewolf in London, Directed by John Landis and Special effects by Bottins mentor Rick Baker.  These two movies held the title for the best ever created until now...

The story plot & special effects make these movies, in my opinion, instant classics! A must watch for any horror/action fan.  The cast is awesome with Selene (Kate Beckinsale) as the definitive heroin, a kickass Vampire with a matrix (Trinity) feel to her, coupled with an excellent portrayal by Bill Nighly (Viktor)and rounded off by Lucian (Played by Micheal Sheen).

So if you love the traditional monsters with modern day high impact, non stop action and love being dazzled by 21st century special effects , then these movies are for you...A must watch!
