My wife enjoys The Eiger Sanction far more than I do.  I actually purchased the DVD for her.  Although I'm quite fond of Clint Eastwood, there are many other movies I'd rather watch than The Eiger Sanction.

The photography from the American southwest is vastly better than the part of the film photographed in Europe, in my opinion.  And Eastwood did his own mountain climbing in The Eiger Sacntion.

I'd far rather watch Dirty Harry, Magnum Force, The Enforcer, or Sudden Impact (all for the 20th time or more) again rather than watch The Eiger Sanction for the third time.  I'm afaid of heights, so this may have something to do with my non-interest in The Eiger Sanction.  On the other hand, this is one of my wife's favorite Clint Eastwood movies.  (The three babes closest to Clint in Play Misty For Me are much easier for a male viewer to look at and enjoy than either of the two women who Clint comes into contact with in The Eiger Saction.  Myself, I'll take Donna Mills any day of the week!)
