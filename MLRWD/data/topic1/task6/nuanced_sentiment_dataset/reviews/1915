To think a nuclear attack in baltimore would be handled the way it is in the story is simply ridiculous. No radiation fall out, nobody starts running when the President does from the stadium even the football players notice. OMG, just wizard of oz story line.
Sorry to those who love the film. It has its moments, but this rookie former USMC is suddenly the savior of the world? Speaks freaking Urkrainian hahahahahaha. Has complete NATO information on Russian Tank locations and numbers.... Sorry 007 type stuff and not what the movie seems to want to protray itself as.... Millions killed and everyone just seems to go on their everyday go to work day. My god, world economies would have collapased, it would have been chaos beyond chaos.... The nuclear bomb of Baltimore was sort of an afterthought in the film IMHO... Oh well.... Movies are made to entertain, I just could not believe the storyline.
cheers and don't be angry at me those who actually read this stuff. Just my opinion. Does not mean you will not enjoy it or should not enjoy the film...
