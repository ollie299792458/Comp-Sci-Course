Martin Scorsese is a director with a gift. He knows he has a great story to tell, and he tells it, in vivid and violent details. De Niro was great as a semi-calm gangster (calm compared to some of his other roles, for example, Max Cady from "Cape Fear" or Paul Viti from "Analyze This"). An even more important character to the film is Joe Pesci's psychopathic gangster. He is a perfect example of what happens when a madman has power. Ray Liota gave a great performance to Henry Hill. What I really liked about this movie was that it was unflinching honesty about the mafia. While "Godfather" was a classic, it glamorized the mafia, instead of showing the disturbing, violent consequences of the mafia. "Goodfellas" shows the mafia at its ups and downs. There are moments when you get that class-Italian feeling, and other moments that make you want to scream in horror. The acting was exceptional (but Liota's wife in this movie annoyed me a bit), the camera angles were good, and the honesty to the story was the best part. An original mob movie directed by a brilliant director. The DVD features are not especially good, but I read they're going to re-release this on a better DVD sometime soon. Scorsese has been robbed of the Oscars WAY too many times. This movie, however, is not for everybody.
