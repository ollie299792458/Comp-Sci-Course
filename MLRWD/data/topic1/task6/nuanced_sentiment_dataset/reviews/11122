I thought this was an overall very interesting piece of work.  It was particularly entertaining to see Jerry Seinfeld - JERRY SEINFELD for chrissakes! - struggling with his act on stage and getting nervous, etc...
It must be rough to go from having one of the best shows on television to doing stand up again, and I had to keep reminding myself that he chose to do things that way.  To wit:  we see Jerry jetting off to his gigs in his obviously private plane, and you know most comics who are "starting out" are lucky to get tickets in coach.  So it's a struggle, but certainly not make it or break it financially for Seinfeld.
Great cast of comics throughout the film (Cosby, Colin Quinn, Chris Rock, Gary Shandling, Ray Romano to name a few), with the exception of one particularly annoying person - Orny Adams.  Man, what a live wire.  Seriously wound waaaaaaaay too tight, he spends most of the movie freaking out about himself, insulting his audience once he's off stage and just generally being annoying.  Somehow, he manages to land George Shapiro as his manager, so I guess he doesn't suck that much, but what is shown of Corny Orny in the film is not flattering.
I'm reducing the rating on this one to three stars because of Orny.  4 stars if he weren't in it.
