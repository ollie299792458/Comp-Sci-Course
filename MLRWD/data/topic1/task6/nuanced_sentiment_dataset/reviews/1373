"Cabaret" is about a young lady named Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) who performs at the Kit Kat Club every night, but dreams of becoming a famous actress. She meets a British tutor named Brian Roberts (Michael York), and they instantly become friends, then lovers. It takes place in 1931 Berlin, just when the Nazis are gaining political power. The performances in this movie are all incredible; Liza was perfectly cast as Sally, and Michael York is wonderful in his role of Brian. Joel Grey is just disturbing and brilliant in his portrayal of the Master of Ceremonies, the role he originated in the Broadway production of "Cabaret". Most musicals have the characters all break out into unified song and dance, but not this movie; all musical numbers are (cleverly) performed in the Kit Kat Club, making it very realistic indeed. The only song not performed in the club is "Tomorrow Belongs To Me", a chilling song sung by a group of Nazis and patriotic Germans. It starts off with a young man singing, and he eventually leads the surrounding Germans into singing the song with violent nationalism. All the musical numbers are excellent, and are all different in their own ways. Bob Fosse's choreography is also excellent. The only problem I have with the movie is that, upon first viewing, I didn't really like it much. But some of the songs grew on me, and I watched it again; now, it's one of my favorite films of all time. I highly reccommend this movie, although it may take two or three viewings to truly appreciate it.
