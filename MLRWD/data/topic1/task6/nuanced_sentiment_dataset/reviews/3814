Also I would like to warn all people on MGM special anniversary editions to movies. I picked up Pride of the Yankees for the dvd art work eventhough I knew it was the exact same movie transfer of the film as it the cheapest mgm Gary cooper movie at only 7.99. I found out why it is the cheapest. Be warned that MGM while quite good at releasing basic movies are the worst at releasing special anniversary editions to any film that they own. Pride of the Yankees 35th anniversary edition comes in a cardboard sleeve. Upon removing this cardboard sleeve, I discovered that the actual artwork on the dvd case is the same as the previous release. In fact it is the previous release with just a cardboard slip case over top of it. They were too lazy to update the artwork to the actual inside dvd case. I am not sure but I don't think they have ever restored or given any extras to any classic movie they own. It is all an evil marketing sceme to fool the customer on their latest anniversary releases where they only update the slip case and not even the dvd case inside.  This is a very unerhanded practice that I will never support again. Despite the 8 Gary Cooper releases last year, I do believe that MGM is the bottom of the barrel for movie companies releasing dvds.

This is a five star movie and one of Gary Cooper's top five movies in my opinion, but will not rate it any higher than one star for the rip off dvd from MGM.
