I caught this when it was first on The History Channel and thought it was a mixed bag.  When I saw it had come out on video I decided to check it out in more detail.  I have to say that mixed bag is a very good term to describe it. The modern computer renditions and graphics are stunning to put it mildly. I also appreciate the emphasis on the first day as well as the battle for Culp's Hill which is almost always left out.  The views of soldiers as well as commanders is a smart idea and one which helps to drive the narration.

Still there are glaring errors and inconsistencies in the story.  The multiple montages of flag bearers being cut down is just gratuitous.  Yes we get that flag bearers were great targets, we don't need to see hundreds cut down. While the stories of the lesser known aspects of the battle are well done, they do cause great harm to the overall story.  It makes the story disjointed and confusing.  Key stories which should be told are ignored and the attempt to move less known stories to the forefront falls flat.  Lastly, the story about the soldier who died with his children's picture in his hand is just wrong.  We don't know if he lingered and he was from upstate New York, not Maine.

All in all this is an interesting and unique telling of the story of the battle but it does not tell the story well and wastes a lot of great opportunities.  It is worth watching but should not be seen as a primary source of information.
