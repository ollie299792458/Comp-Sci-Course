It is commonly known by Moviegoers the world around that some films are not really appreciated until years after they leave the box office. Psycho 1998 is one of those films, It received a bad reputation way before it even came out. I regrettably was one of those people and I admit I was wrong. Most people just jumped on the "hate a remake" bandwagon and that's because the original was such a coveted classic. I remember watching the original with my Grandmother and my cousins back when I was 7 years old. Many people can tell a similar memory of when they saw the original so it wasn't a matter of the remake being bad it was more a matter of no one wanted to see they're memories tampered with.
PSYCHO 1998 is a frame for frame update and that is all! Seriously take the original version and play it next to the 1998 remake and be amazed. The 1998 remake made me appreciate and want to watch the Original even more. So, in the end don't give too much flack to the remake of PSYCHO it really is worth watching.
