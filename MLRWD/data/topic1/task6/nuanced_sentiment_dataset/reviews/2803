It's long.  And that's not a good thing, but probably a necessity in its  "made for TV" mini-series form.  But, while it doesn't thrive on  its length, it does survive it.
I do blue-water sailing, and that  probably biases me in favor of the movie.  But, at the same time, I do  science/engineering.  And I found myself wondering how many people came  away from watching this film convinced that the astronomers who proposed a  "celestial clock" were just jealous and nutty.  They also  happened to be correct, and that notion was suppressed to the point of  turning an enterprise in knowledge into a good-guy/bad-guy triviality.  There's something inherently distorting to having "a hero"  anyway, but this went beyond distortion, and into pandering.  A step too  far -- the importance of the chronometer doesn't need to be shouted;  with  the emphasis on the "bad-guy" character of the astronomers, the  possibility of learning something about the era (the human beings of the  era) was lost.
Note to movie-makers.  You don't have to hit me over the  head in order to get me to see where you're going.
Nonetheless, I can't  fault the flow of the story, the acting (damn -- if this is for Television,  then the folks in Hollywood are a bit without a clue) the direction, nor  the filming itself.  It survived the four hours, an amazing feat given the  subject matter.
It does make me wonder, though, whether it might not have  become a shorter and better (much better) film, if the Jeremy Irons  character had simply been cut.  Oh, the cut film could have been saved for  use as acting lessons -- this may have been the best performance Irons has  ever given, and that's worth a lot.  But, if something has to go (and, the  film is long) then better to cut ruthlessly than to nibble away  fearfully.
Rent it -- it's worth that, well worth the price to avoid the  loss of continuity from TV commercials.  Don't buy it because you won't  watch it more than once or twice.
