In 1990, NASCAR was still a southern sport.  Feuds were downplayed, race coverage was still in its early days, and drivers respected one another.

Days of Thunder exploits the access they were given to NASCAR, and presents the sport in one of the lowest extremes possible.  Although some incidents are inspired by actual events (A similar event to the ice cream segment in the movie happened to former driver Benny Parsons in the late 1980s), the idea that drivers would smash into each other, and the pace car without reccourse is unrealistic for the time frame in which the movie was shot (although, I wouldn't be surprised to see such an occurance these days), and only enhanced the sports images as a "redneck" sport.

The movie does have its positive sides, such as cameos by Rusty Wallace and the late Neil Bonnett, as well as some driving done by actual NASCAR drivers (Greg Sacks, Bobby Hamilton, and Hut Stricklin).

Longtime fans of the sport may note resemblences between former driver Tim Richmond and his crew chief, Harry Hyde.
