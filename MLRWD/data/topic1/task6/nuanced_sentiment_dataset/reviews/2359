This is a classic sci-fi movie with two GREAT actors: Charlton Heston & the last appearance of Edward G. Robinson, plus a very sexy Leigh Taylor-Young. This movie is considered a classic, and even with their limited SFX, there's still a well communicated sense of crowding, systemic failure, and human degradation. The plot is an interesting mystery, and the relationships are complex and interesting, especially between Heston's and Robinson's characters.

This movie has some of the classic lines that have been repeated in spoofs and parodies. It's also given us a metaphor for the environmental damage that results from overcrowding, and the harmful effects it has on the humans that create it.

I'm not going to lie, the movie does have some scenes that feel dated. This was more about what the 70's thought the future would be like, then how they are or (probably) will be. From the clothing, the furniture, and attitudes about sex and women ... this definitely feels like a movie of it's time. Even so, it was fun to watch with my wife, who had never seen it, and it was interesting to see how much I remembered and how much I had inferred but was not specifically stated. For this price, and for the influence this movie has had and the performances involved ... it's definitely a good purchase.
