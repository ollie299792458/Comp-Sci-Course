First off I do recommend this Blu-Ray Book Set.  I am no fool.  Blue Ray is better than dvd and dvd is better than VHS.  Having said that If you compare certain scenes of the all 3 formats like I have done you will see the limitations of the digital blue ray.  DVD's hate fog.  Blue Rays hate fog even more.  I assume you are familiar with this movie.  Think of the scene where the captain, the movie director, Fay Wray, and Bruce Cabot are leaning on the railing of the ship at night IN THE FOG as they near skull island.  You can hardly tell who Bruce Cabot (first mate) is during this scene!  Because for the Blue Ray to look great you need a good high contrast image to start with.  During this particular scene the VHS looks the best, then DVD, and the Blue Ray simply looks HORRID.  But..... when you have bright scenes with sunlight and high contrast the Blue Ray clearly looks superior.  This is very ironic but try it yourself and you'll see what I mean.  The same phenomenea occurs with the Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes movies.  I have the complete set in VHS, in DVD, and now on Blue Ray.  On a high contrast scene the Blue Ray clearly is best.  BUT WHEN there is a scene with little contrast between light and dark such as in the FOG, (Rathbone/Bruce Sherlock Holmes movies have a lot of London fog)then the BLUE RAY looks like black and white peppery SAND everywhere.  In my opinion, special remastering techniques should be employed during such scenes as these.  Look at it from another perspective,  in VHS the tiny FAY WRAY doll in KONG'S hand looks believable but with the resolution of BLUE RAY the little doll looks much more FAKE.  I love this movie and I'd pick blue ray if I could keep one instead of all 3 but compare scenes in the fog and you will see that Blue Ray looks very bad trying to "make sense" of the fog.  Very IRONIC.
