Why can't George Clooney find a decent script, you really have to ask yourself.  He keeps getting trapped in clunker after clunker.  "The Descendants" is no exception.  This is basically a thinly written family soap opera set against lush Hawaiian backdrops.  And it's made worse by an endless, cloying, folksy Hawaiian falsetto crooner who no doubt is expressing deep island sentiments, but who I really must remember not to invite to my next luau.  There is annoying light guitar plucking too -- a seemingly endless stream of it as the movie lurches toward its climax.  These musical accompaniments are supposed to add seriousness and significance to the proceedings, but they seem at odds with very thin material, not to mention the inexplicably hostile atmosphere provided by Clooney's two daughters, who are angry at not just their mother, although they never truly explain why, but against you and me and the world.  Clooney never seems to connect with them in any true emotional way.  And some of their reactions, indeed Clooney's as well, and motivation seem dubious here, the more so because we never actually get to know what their mother was really like.  How can you make a movie about the death of a woman who has betrayed her husband, and not devote at least a modicum of screen time to her when she was actually alive, so that we might get to know what kind of a relationship they actually had?  It makes absolutely no sense.  It's bizarre.  Clooney is angry that his wife betrayed him, blindsided him, and yet she's comatose and can't defend her feelings. When all is said and done, we only get to view these characters and their motivations in a superficial way.  It's the feature film equivalent of a mediocre Hallmark Family Channel drama.  I'm amazed that an actor of Clooney's stature can't come up with better material than this.
