I'm not the biggest fan of Japanese animation, but this film is absolutely beautiful.  I don't see how anyone could not absolutely love this film.  
Grave of the Fireflies is a powerful anti-war film that will touch anyone, no matter what culture or country you live in.  It is one of the greatest films I have ever seen, animated or live-action.  The story revolves around a brother and a sister, Seita- 14, and Setsuko- 4.  It shows the brother, Seita, as he tries to get enough food for himself and for his sister, and food is not an easy thing to come by in post World War II- Japan.  The ending is powerful, and had me crying like a baby...
I watched this movie 3 days ago, and I still cry whenever I think about it.  Many of the scenes I feel will be haunting me for a long time.  Every time Setsuko started crying, I felt like crying along with her.  The director did a very good job of portraying the characters and making them seem real.  It is an extremely powerful, yet beautiful film depicting the evils of war.  The animation is great, and the dubbing is pretty solid, although not perfect.  The soundtrack is also excellent.  It is a must for any DVD collection, and just begs for repeated viewings.  
The movie would probably get a PG rating, it does have a little bit of violence and blood, but I honestly wouldn't want to show it to anyone under the age of 12.  The overall story and message are too depressing for many.  I am 23 and I was bawling by the end of the movie.
