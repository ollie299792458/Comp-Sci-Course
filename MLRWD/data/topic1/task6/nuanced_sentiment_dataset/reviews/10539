This film is a great life lesson for kids and adults. Ms. Hamilton proves that the obstacles that can truly defeat us are the ones that we create ourselves. When My kids saw it the first time they wanted to see it again. That was O K with me because I got more out of it the second time. The kids immediately wanted the book. I found it Amazon and they have both read it. My Little girl is 10 and my boy is almost 7. I wasn't sure if He would be O K with the shark scene. It was really amazing how quickly it occurred. The scene was realistic without being gory.  In a split second this young girls life was changed but not altered.
 My kids often refer to Bethany Hamilton when they are faced with challenges. She is a fantastic gift to humanity. In a time where kids are subjected to any number manufactured role models, here is a true spiritual giant. Her faith, grit and perseverance are a reminder to all of us that, regardless of the hand life deals us, faith is our ace in the hole. Soul Surfer is a valuable message for tough times.  The CD gets a lot of play when the kids have friends over. Well done.
