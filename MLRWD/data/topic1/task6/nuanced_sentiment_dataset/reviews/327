Elizabeth Banks is a pretty good actress, which is a suprise after she was basically only eye candy in the movie 40-Year-Old Virgin.

Just a basic movie of people finding themselves, that for a change is not presented in a cheesy way.

The movie and characters are well written. Banks is presented as one of those cliche, born to privledge photographers who is so intrigued by the human condition and the inanity of everyday life and the affections of the poor and downtrodden. A typical, I am special and trying to find myself character. Like "look I am so deep, unique and artistic" kind of a character. Her interactions with reality and other people and their ability to sift through her carfully manufactured BS, is what makes this movie interesting. She is basically shot down and called a phony for her persona.

This just kind of mirrors with what is happening with the other characters in the movie. They seem as if they fit a stock character mode of what their character should be and the world in subtle ways rips that apart and exposes them.

It is a pretty good movie.

This is worthy of a purchase. Banks, Marsden and Close are all solid.
