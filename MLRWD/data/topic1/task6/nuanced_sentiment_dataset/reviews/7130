Here are the pros. and conts:

Good:

* A character use a gun pretending that his hand isn't holding anything (this idea inspired johnny Depp in One Upon Time in Mexico).

* There is blood and gore but is not THAT intense. (very similar to the movie Naked Prey in 1965).

* The wind blowing while Yojimbo walks inspired many japanese animations.

* The village setting inspired the videogame Way of the Samurai. (The village is the only setting in the movie)

* Cool moves by Toshiro Mifune.

* There are many suspense scenes.

Bad:

* No colors, just black and white.

* There are like 3 action scenes and only two were memorable, most of the movie is blah,blah,blah.

* No sword-sound when Yojimbo slash his enemies.

* There was NO snow-battle in the movie as I expected (I saw this calendar called Yojimbo showing a rabbit dressed up like a samurai with his sword fighting in the snow, I though that would appear in the movie.)

P.S: This movie didn't have to be in black and white, the movie Samurai in the 50's also starting Toshiro Mifune was made in good colors and the movie is also a classic like Yojimbo but if the director Akira Korusawa liked black and white then "bummer!".

Adios!
