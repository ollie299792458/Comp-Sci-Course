My first memory of Dark Shadows was staying up late to catch reruns on a local TV channel when I was younger.From the early B/W episodes(the creepier feeling ones) to the later color ones I couldn't stop watching .Even though most of the stories are right out of the classic horror/thriller novels that never bothered me .It was the quick pacing of the stories and tragic fate of the characters that I liked most.Yopu knew that bad thing were in store for the family but they were most of the time powerless to stop it.No storyline was endlessly drawn out to where you would lose interest in it. Now the powers that be have decided to release the series on DVD. I'm a little dissapointed that it doesn't start at the very beginning with Jossette's ghost and the Phoenix ,but when they did the VHS tapes they started with the Resurrection of Barnabas also .I hope that the DVD run of the series will go to the very end with the story of 1841 PT with the final voice-over telling the fate of the Collins family .I will look forward to each new wave of Dark Shadows DVD like I used too for each new episode late night on TV.
