3 stars might be a little generous. The movie started off with state of the art special effects and high suspense. Alien invasions in the form of city-sized spacecraft had everybody very interested in the beginning. Too bad that after about an hour and a half or so in the movie the writers decided to wrap it up before the movie ran too long. I guess the writers figured that since we've already impressed the audience enough with our special effects, let's just tack on a quick and happy ending where our heroes easily fly into the mother ship, blow it up, fly out and then crashland the same ship that killed three aliens back in the fifties by the way. Then walk away smoking cigars without a scratch on them. Okay, everybody's happy.

Well not me. In a movie with so much build up in the beginning, I like to see a more intelligent and well thought out conclusion. But this is hollywood. We've already sold our tickets, now let's just sell out. Mainstream America will enjoy this film. There's not a lot of thought, just impressive visual effects.
