**Spoiler alert**

I greatly enjoy classic films, but something went wrong with this one. I agree with most of the glowing reviews of the fine acting, casting, music, and even the Christmas nostalgic feel.  But what ruins the enjoyment for me is the lack of finesse and attention to details I've seen in classics like "It's A Wonderful Life", and "Harvey".  "K-Pax" was far better at showing the fantastic, with some subtlety.

The miracles are blatant, not subtle. Dudley calls everyone he meets by name, and no one reacts appropriately to this, or any of the other supernatural ocurrences.  The continual filling of the sherry glasses happens too many times, and refilling of the bottle is overused. The skating scene is ... without director restraint and almost silly. So was decorating the tree. Typing the sermon (pressing the keys from across the room?) made no sense, other than to show off.

Obvious wizardry like we see in this film ... leaves no room for faith, for the viewer or the characters. And all the players that act as if these events are just strange, not fantastic, come across as dunces. Despite a fine premise, the groups of writers that reworked the story for film dropped the ball. I feel they wasted a superb opportunity with an intriguing plot, wonderful actors, and very good direction.  The only way I can recommend this film is like a shipwreck being a warning to other ships where the reef is.
