blood feast 2 is the sequel to the 1960's film blood feast directed by herschell gordon lewis. i havent seen the original but i'm aware of its reputation of being the first splatter film ever made. blood feast 2 is the only film i have seen of mr. lewis and after being very entertained and my thirst for gore being more than quenched i will probably seek out his other films. this film is very entertaining and very, very, very gory. the plot involves the grandson of the killer from the original blood feast inheriting his grandfathers catering buisiness and after being possed or hypnotized or something by a magic statue of the godess ishtar he begins murdering and mutilating the bridesmaids of a wedding hes catering and using their flesh to prepare the wedding food. this may sound campy and it is. the whole film is campy and corny. some of the acting is pretty bad, but the actor who plays the killer does a good job at being demented, charming and funny. also the 2 cops are funny to watch. the film is more of a comedy than a horror film. the only thing that makes it a horror film is the extremely graphic carnage and gore. the film is filled with disembowlment, eye gouging, throat cutting, scalping and many other forms of mutilation. the gore scenes are long and very graphic and the special effects, while not 100% convincing are pretty good. this is, as the bach of the dvd states, a gorehounds wet dream. this movie is almost buying for the splatter alone, but the entire film is fun and never gets boring. as i said before, the film is really a comedy and if it took itself seriously than the gore would be some of the most gross and brutal stuff ever(not that it isnt gross or brutal, it is). the comedy works, the gore is amazing and the whole film is very enjoyable. any gorehound should pick this up, just make sure you get the uncut version.
