The movie itself is 4 stars.  Unfortunately, the dialogue on this Blu-Ray is, particularly in "quiet" scenes often unintelligible.  It is almost as if the characters are whispering.  Then, out of the blue, in some cases, the whispering goes to "shouting" for a word or two, when the characters are certainly NOT shouting.  I've never encountered this on Satellite, Laserdisc, DVD, or Blu Ray before; using multiple versions of components.

All the reviews I've looked at (on review site) all declare the dialogue to be entirely intelligible, so perhaps I have a bad pressing, but I can't imagine that is possible.

This audio issue prevented me from hearing a good chunk of dialogue (and yes my volume was set so high the "action scenes" were theater-ish) so I really could not appreciate the experience.  Leaning forward, upping the volume when a dialogue scene came on, then lowering it when it looked like the guns were starting to blaze was entirely distracting.

As such, I can only give this DISC 2 stars.  And that was a stretch.
