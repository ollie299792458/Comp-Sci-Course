Once in awhile a film comes along that is well made, but vile in concept and execution.  "Leaving Las Vegas" is such a movie.  While it is hard to argue that the performances of stars Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue are not first rate, unfortunately they serve a plot which is misogynistic, exceddingly unpleasent and utterly pointless.  Don't get me wrong, there have been some excellent movies that have portrayed destruction through drugs and alcohol.  "Less Than Zero" and "The Boost" are two examples that immediately come to mind.  But "Leaving Las Vegas" not only glamorizes Cage's self-determined destruction through alcohol, but manages to thoroughly degrade Shue's character at the same time.  There is one scene for example , in which Shue is gang raped in a hotel room, that is completely gratutitous.  It doesn't advance the plot and seems to serve no purpose other than showing the filmaker's contempt for her character.  The relationship between the two of them has some tender moments, but ultimately come to no apparent point.
Going to the movies ought to be an enjoyable experience, or failing that, it at least ought to be enlightening.  "Leaving Las Vegas" is neither.  It is a degrading peep show of a movie.
