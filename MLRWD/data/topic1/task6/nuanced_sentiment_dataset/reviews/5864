Miami Herald Pulitzer-prize winning collumnist Dave Barry wrote this frantic farce that plays off like a Saturday Night/Sunday Morning hangover, leaving you confused and looking for answers of Who, What, When, Where, and most importantly, How.  Ok, maybe not...but it still is pretty weird when it comes to comedies that try not to be comedies of that sort.  In reason, director Barry Sonnenfeld does only two-types of movies: funny ones (i.e. "Men in Black", "Get Shorty") and movies you're embarassed to admit you saw ("Wild Wild West").  This goes down the middle line of Sonnenfeld's genre.  To be frank, the film is a Deja Fu of "Get Shorty" without the funny twist and clear plot...actually, it goes without plot.
There really isn't any plot to "Big Trouble".  However, many talented directors have made one singular mistake in their career in at least one of their movies...the more celebrities, there is much less need for a plot.  Steven Spielberg learned this lesson harshly with his God-awful unfunny comedy, "1941", and Rob Reiner too, with "North".  But what can you say?  It works...very little of the time.  Being virtually plotless, it showcases a different approach to the average zero-to-hero story without any theatrics.  It's not really Good vs. Bad, but more like a race of who is the Goodest and who is the Badest.  Some characters aren't even fitted into the story, but are still shown copously for no apperant reason.  It's still funny though.  I suggest at least renting it.  Other than that, stay away.  This one is just looking for "Trouble" (Pun intended)
