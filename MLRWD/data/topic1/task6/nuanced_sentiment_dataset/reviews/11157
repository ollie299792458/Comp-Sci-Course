I was drawn to this movie after perusing through some of the John Carpenter movie lists here on Amazon. The customer reviews tended to be generally positive so I figured I'd give it a try.

There were many parts of this movie which were laugh-out-loud funny and there were others which were almost painful to watch. There were parts of the "alien" sequence which were completely hilarious but I felt that the whole sequence was about 5 min too long.

As long as the viewer can ignore the gaping plot holes and the no-budget wardrobe doesn't detract too much, this movie can be enjoyed for what it was - a student film by a future master of the genre (sci-fi, horror, suspense).

There were parts of this film that can be recognized in more modern films with much larger budgets (the light-speed sequence for one - eat your heart out G Lucas LOL).

Buy this one if only to complete your Carpenter library but rent it with one of your buddies and a few beers to enjoy this brief glimpse into the formative mind of John Carpenter.
