Was it the long polka-dot hot pink shirt with the belt around it? Was it the leotards? Was it "The Time of My Life," Johnny's final number? I can't remember, but at some point you remember that this isn't really the '60s. Oh, it was Baby's hair. Nobody puts her Aqua Net in the corner!

I watched this flick for the first time ever, after having some weird compulsion that told me that everyone else in my generation had seen it. Now I know why I should have seen it when it came out - when I was in elementary school.

Can anyone actually call this a good movie with a straight face? Now, I know I risk getting "unhelpful" votes because of my unpopular opinion, but you gotta realize that a 25-year-old man in 2004 may not have the same sort of feelings a 14-year-old girl would have in 1987.

This movie is silly, unrealistic, and lacks any real conflict. I waited almost two hours to hear Swayze's most famous line. I was surprised that Baby was literally sitting in the corner. Maybe she likes to see everybody. I always sit in the corner in restaurants.

Anyway, I'm giving it 2 stars for 2 reasons: 1)I respect a man who can dance without seeming a little light in his big black boots and 2)"Love is Strange" is one of the sexiest songs of the '50s.

Biggest Laugh: Patrick Swayze mouthing "Owe it all to you," in a very dramatic number - right in front of Baby's parents! She's grounded.

By the way, how long were they at that camp? Was it the whole summer? Because Baby got good fast!
