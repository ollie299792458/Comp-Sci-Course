Since I really enjoyed the first Blade, I was excited about the sequel. This film was a terrible disappointment. Instead of utilizing traditional filmmaking tools, such as actors, plot, and character development, director Guillermo del Toro throws in one lame action sequence after another. Don't think that this endless action is a good thing. Half the fighting is uninspired and full of pitiful CGI.  Where the final showdown in part 1 was a classic kenjutsu duel, in part 2 it is a stupid brawl, replete with ridiculous wrestling moves. I'm using the word stupid a lot because that is the word that this entire movie reeks of. It is as if the movie was designed to deliver cheap thrills that would only satisfy the stupid. I was insulted by this movie, as if the director was suggesting I was stupid and trying to take my money by tricking me into seeing this trash. It is obvious that  Guillermo del Toro was not affiliated with the first Blade, as there is an absence of complete stinkiness in that movie. The first movie was by no means perfect, and so I thought that this one would expand on the first and continue an entertaining and noble franchise. Sadly, this movie did not do so. This is the kind of sequel that makes you ashamed that you saw the first one at all. Pure filth.
