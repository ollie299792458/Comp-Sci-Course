I think this is 235 or something. That alone should be enough to tell you something about the power that this movie still commands to generate controversy, to offend, to hypnotize, and to shock. And if you don't enjoy films that can do that 60 years after they were made, you should probably be browsing the music section.
There are a lot of folks who will tell you this film "sucks" pretty much because of where it finished in some poll of snobs. They don't like snobs. So they trash the film. That's missing the point.
Some others try to outsnob the snobs, by making hyperarcane references to camera angles, cuts and lost films of the 1910s and 1920s. They miss the point too.
But, if you can get past all the social and personal problems of the many unedited reviewers here, and simply plug in this film with a bowl of popcorn and a beer on a Thursday night -- and somehow manage to watch withut prejudice -- you almost can't help but be entertained. "Citizen Kane" is still maybe the most watchable movie I've ever seen. Dark, mysterious, glorious and wistful. You don't need a PhD to see what kind of man Kane could be and the kind of man he becomes. However, if you DO happen to have a PhD, there's more intellectual meat the the bone of this film than many smart folks can digest in a lifetime.
Bottom line: "Citizen Kane" is going to be as close as any film will ever come to being all things to all people. Which is still a long way from actually being that -- thus the controversy -- but getting even this close is an exhilirating trip.
