I liked the idea of the film because of the 'car wars' reference. The movie apparently is a remake of a book or movie called 'car wars 2000' though i was interested in the concept because of a game called 'car wars' by a dice game company.

The movie has a very simplistic character development and you don't feel the characters so you don't really get into the film. A lot of the film is quickly moved on. Again no development.

The Plot is written to move quick and like the characters pretty blah. so you can predict its every move.

As for the action, it is alright though if you want to actually see the action it is a bit like 'daredevil' in that the camera bounces around so fast you can't really see what is going on or get an idea. I personally don't like that as much.

The way it is shot, the taste of the grit look is nice and gives a nice appeal.

i give it a C- really. not a memorable one, nor really just fun, but just is. A let down for me.
