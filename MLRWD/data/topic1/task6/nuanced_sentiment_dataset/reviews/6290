Okay, I was actually at the video store looking for a copy of Drive Me Crazy and I found one for 26 dollars.  Then I found it in a double pack with First Daughter for only 15 dollars.

I got the double pack because it was cheaper and decided to have a look at First Daughter.

I had to turn off the movie after 15 minutes.  Katie Holmes's character had the personality of cardboard.  She seems to spend her time walking around with a fake smile plastered on her face pretending to have fun.

These movies are always the same - rich girl wants a real life, she rebels and falls in love with some handsome guy who looks like a model, he teachs her about real life, they fall in love, they either have a fight or betray each other, then get back together at the end.

Katie Holmes bored me and so did the guy she fell in love with.  I could see what was going to happen next.  The whole movie was so sickly sweet I literally wanted to throw up.

I think I'll stick to Drive Me Crazy and just forget that I own this movie.
