Oh my gosh, my entire family is hysterical because we can't believe we paid to rent this CHEESY movie!  It was so stupid,we couldn't believe it!  The ONLY good thing I can say is that our entire family was laughing so hard we could hardly breathe. This movie should not be rated; if there was a zero star, I would have give it that rating.  I could make a better movie myself using a lower budget and better acting.  "The Mariachi" had a $7,000 budget and it was a zillion times better.  How much did this piece of junk movie cost?  I'll tell you what, I'm so upset I missed "Stargate SG-1" show to see this nonsense!  Stargate SG-1 has better effects.

Rent this movie for the following three reasons:

1.  You are a film student and want to know how NOT to make a movie;

2.  You need a good laugh; or

3.  You have people over that you don't like and you want to get rid of them.  Believe me, they will all say "goodnight" early rather than being subjected to viewing this movie.
