I remember going to see this movie at least five times in the theater when it first came out. I was totally blown away. I realized what my father's generation must have felt like when they saw Lawrence of Arabia for the first time. The sheer majesty of this film is incredible and it's one that helped brought back the epic motion picture.
With the new DVD you get an extra hour of film and all of it is worth watching. There is more character development, shots of vistas that must have bought tears to the eyes when it did not make the first cut, and what really happened the soldiers that abandoned Fort Sedgewick. The picture quality was good and it does not take away from the film, but I agree with other critics when they say they were expecting something a little bit more vibrant coming from the DVD. Especially when MGM has done wonders when rereleasing their eye-popping musicals.
The behind the scenes documentary the typically formatted but very good. Fans will enjoy. The feature that the was most unneccessary was the introduction to the photo gallery. The Photos are great, however Ben Glass comes out with his dog and reads from a contrived script, making this feature very schmaltzy.
The feature I did enjoy most was the Costner/Wilson commentary. Very informative and worth listening to. Costner bounces between being self absorbed to being very gracious. But they manage to stick to the point as the movie plays. It's obvious that Costner and Wilson love this film. Points also go to them talking about the many names of the that appear on the end credits and where their careers went with as much emphasis as they did with the actors and film crew. Very classy.
If you are a fan of Dances with Wolves, epics or westerns, this is definitley worth having. Already considered a modern classic.
