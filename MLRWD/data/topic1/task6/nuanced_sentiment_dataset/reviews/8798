"The Happening" didn't.  M. Night Shyamalan's film rested on a strange premise.  While I liked the environmental message echoed in "The Day the Earth Stood Still" that man must be a partner with nature on the planet, the idea that a substance could abrogate free will and drive masses to suicide seemed preposterous.  If the plants had decided to go on an oxygen strike and people started suffocating, that might have made more sense.  Here we have wind blowing on the grass or the wind in a tree which is supposed to be a sinister event.  Shyamalan's image of people jumping from buildings was unique as was the car crash.  However, these moments could not salvage a weak premise.

The shaky premise was also complicated by the lack of acting performance.  This has to be a failure of Shyamalan as a director to elicit good work from most of his actors.  I did like two performances in the film.  Betty Buckley was the coach in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792839676">Carrie</a> in her first film back in 1976 & played a country singer in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005R246">Tender Mercies</a>.  She won a Tony award for "Cats."  As Mrs. Jones, she creates one of the creepiest characters I've seen in a long time, a woman who lives in the middle of nowhere, cut off from contact with the outside world with no telephone, television, radio or computer.  When she smashes her head through the glass, it is the crowning moment to a woman who slapped the girl's hand for reaching for a cookie and screamed with paranoia that her guests were trying to steal from her shabby old house.

Another good cameo was by soap star Kristen Connolly who played a confused woman reading on a bench.  Her confusion and odd behavior sets the tone for upcoming events.  Child actress Ashlyn Sanchez as Jess did an acceptable job with the little she was asked to do.  Her stoic stare as her father abandons her has to be Shyamalan's choice.  Alan Ruck who was in the great film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RFFI">Twister</a> as well as "Speed" has a brief cameo as the principal.

On the negative side, Colombian-born actor John Leguizamo was in a film I liked, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007W7I4W">Assault on Precinct 13 (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HRMAVS">The Groomsmen</a> now joins this film as two for which I did not care.  As the father Julian, I understand his concern over the fate of his wife.  However, his abandonment of his daughter in a stressful uncertain time was inexcusable.  And this was BEFORE he went nuts.  Leguizamo did what he was asked to do; so again the fault in conception is with the director.  Mark Wahlberg's cardboard thin performance as science teacher Elliot Moore may have one wondering if this was the same actor nominated for an Oscar for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M341QE">The Departed (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  In the scene where he's separated from his wife, his level of concern was very low.

For me the worst performance of the film, the real raspberry, is Zooey Deschanel as Alma.  This actress had received a Best Actress nomination by the Independent Spirit Awards for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ZPTY">All the Real Girls</a> and was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010DR4BO">The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</a>.  I have no idea what Shyamalan said to her to get such a wide-eyed vacant stare as a woman who thinks she may have destroyed her marriage and faces the lethal health crisis that threatens her life.

While the cinematography was good, the story and major performances preclude me wanting to watch it again.  Taxi!
