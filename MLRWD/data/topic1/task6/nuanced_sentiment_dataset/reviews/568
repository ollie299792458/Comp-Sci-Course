Each of the four stories that unfold and then converge in this film would have made, on their own, fine films: a desperate father trying to blindly rescue his deranged son, a depressed girl attempting anything to get her aloof mother's attention, even suicide who ironically fights to live in the movies climax, a sad-sack romantic jilted at the alter finding comfort in a childhood fantasy, a sci-fi superhero hunting down the killer of a little girl in a twisted and dark city of the future. It is the blending of the stories that leaves many viewers unimpressed. Those looking for a sci-fi thriller will be a bit disappointed by the measured pace of the present-day London scenes.  Viewers expecting a psychological character study will be put off by the violence of the Meanwhile City sequences. Those looking for simple, easy to follow story telling will be totally befuddled (like many of the posters here on Amazon). There is also a strong anti-religious undertone to the entire affair that might put-off some viewers.

However, if you are a fan of good movie making, outstanding acting (especially Bernard Hill as the desperate but bumbling father), and clever story-telling, then you should enjoy this film. Maybe it's not visionary or ground-breaking and some may think its derivative, but in the end, I found it to be very entertaining and eminently satisfying. And any film with the incomparable Eva Green is definitely worth watching.

Finally, fans of the sci-fi artist Brom will be delighted by the artistic similarity to his work in many of the customs and sets.
