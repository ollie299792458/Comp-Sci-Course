I'm not sure why other reviewers found this movie to be good, but I did not like it at all.  I usually love romantic comedies and would not consider myself a harsh movie critic at all. The previews were very decieving. This movie was not a comedy, rather a badly made drama.  There were some funny parts, but the main theme of the movie was supposed to be deep.  The dialogue and scenes did not support the deep, emotional theme that the movie was trying to go for.  There was way too much drama where it clearly didn't fit.  Most of the main guy's lines were cheesy or they tried to reach for depth where there was none.  The whole plot was random, too.  The focus is supposed to be on Debra Messing's character, but you get sidetracked by her sister's role.  Overall I found this movie to be odd, poorly edited (strange meaningless scenes i.e. in a limo cruising through London after the bachelorette party- you have to see it to know what I mean), and overly dramatic. If you like romantic comedies do not see this train wreck.
