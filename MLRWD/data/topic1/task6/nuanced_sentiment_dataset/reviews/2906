It's been ten years since Thunderheart appeared in theaters, and it is still holds up as a powerful, insightful, and eloquent film.
I have traveled through the Pine Ridge Lakota reservation and Badlands National Park in western South Dakota, around which Thunderheart was filmed. I've made pilgrimages there both around the time this film appeared and as recently as last week (I live in Texas). Anytime I am close to that area, Thunderheart is the first film that comes to mind, just as Dances With Wolves inevitably comes to mind when I'm in the Black Hills, just to the west. 
Thunderheart successfully combines the Lakota's modern 'Feds on the Rez' dilemmas with a wry, witty, ironic, laconic sense of Native American wisdom and mysticism. The film loosely and hauntingly combines the Leonard Peletier story (see "Incident at Ogalala" and/or read Peter Matthiessen's book "In the Spirit of Crazy Horse") with implications and memories of the Wounded Knee tragedy and the plight of a dispossessed and plundered people.
Kilmer and Sheppard get top billing, and both are good, but really, Graham Greene steals the show. His sassy, kick the dirt, Lakota Charlie Chan detective is priceless. Thunderheart conveys the sinister reality of the present along with a triumpant confrontation for which those of us who care about the plight of the Plains Indians certainly hope. "This land is not for sale. This land is not for sale!"
Buy this movie, and show your support and your sympathy for the people who once lorded over the plains.
