There are two main reasons why this film is a failure, despite being graphically very attractive.

1) The writer/director simply poured into it everything he could think of: space aliens, aliens from extra dimensions, portals to unknown worlds, hybernation, space ships, flying cars, lasers, mutants, gods...

2) Nothing is explained and apparently no character has a motive to do anything they do. Why all Horus wants is to have sex, instead of escaping or clearing himself of charges (that are never explained)? Why did the pyramid come to Earth, since those "special women" are mentioned to appear all over the space? Why did the pyramid leave Earth and where did it go? Why it sometimes teleports, and sometimes moves slowly? Why did they suck in the fat guy? What did Nikopol do to deserve being frozen and why he didn't continue to do it after getting alive again (or at least ever mentioning it at least once)? Who/what is actually John and where did he go? What is the point of barriers around Central Park since they stopped no one from entering and leaving? What was inside killing people, except it wasn't later? What was that sparkling thing there?

Simply... we know nothing. Since we know nothing - how and why anyone got here, what are their goals, what they expect to gain by doing anything they do - we don't care about any of characters.
