What can you say about a film like this - and all 155 minutes of it?  I am surprised that Tinto Brass had his name removed from the outer packaging credits, although it is still on the actual movie itself.  The comparison between this and the heavily cut version speaks for itself.  Chiefly it is the imperial bordello scene where Caligula makes the senators wives available for sex that stands out purely on a sexual level.  To be honest, it is no-holds barred sex: fellatio, cunnilingus and actual sex, as one of the actresses mentioned during the documentary sequence from the DVD menu.  Yes, it happened in Rome and that is the reason for the inclusion of graphic sex.  All that aside, the film does accurately deal with Caligula's life, and portrays the character of this evil emperor well.  Malcolm McDowell is well supported by Helen Mirren, Sir John Gielgud, Peter O'Toole et al.  The darkness of the time comes over with a sense of menace, and this is portrayed well by the opening bars of the soundtrack too.  One earlier reviewer mentioned that most, if not all, the women were very hairy.  Well, considering the film was shot in 1979 when underwear that one might say preferred women to shave their intimate parts was not readily available, if at all, then that comes as no surprise.  For me, I much prefer hairy women anyway.  I would imagine that this version of the film, given its content, would only be available in the UK directly in licensed sex shops, but that is another matter.  If you can take what is served up, then you are in for a gripping, thrilling but rather unnerving evening.
