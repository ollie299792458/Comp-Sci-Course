If you are a Brit mystery addict, there's never enough mysteries to watch.  Well, here's another one--cosy in genre--to entertain you.  Two women of a certain age, one a horticulturalist and the other a former policewoman, meet up and garden and solve crimes together.  Conveniently there's a murder it seems everywhere they pull weeds.
Skeletons often come up with the weeds.

One of the primary pleasures of this series is to get into the gorgeous English homes/cottages and visually stroll around the gardens.  I'm not a gardener, unfortunately, although this series is motivating to do some, so can't speak to how much gardenese is offered up in a segment.  But I imagine any one who loves gardening, England and mysteries will find this a delectable treat.

If you're not crazy about the first show, keep watching, as the characters warm up to each other and to the scripts.  They seemed to be having a jolly time and their joy is infectious.  I love to watch mysteries while on the treadmill as I get so involved in solving the crime, time flies by quickly which helps when you're on the treadmill.  The scenery and sets are exceptionally breathtaking in this series, compared to some of the gritty background for other English mysteries like Inspector Frost.  The scenery fairly blooms in this series.  And it helps that the murders are more genteel--if they are too grisly I have to get off the treadmill and recover.

These are a little bit of fun and frolic with flowers with a mystery to solve--should please most English mystery aficionados.
