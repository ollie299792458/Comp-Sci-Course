This is the funniest Allen film ever, bar none.  I first saw this film when it was released when I was 14 and it has stuck with me ever since.  I've seen it more times than I can count and still am in tears every time.  I love the juxtaposition of modern life with 19th century Russian society (the black Russian DI is as funny as it comes).  While far from a student of Russian lit, the reference to the Karamozov Brothers is hilarious.  A laugh a minute which never fails to get me rolling on the floor.  Allen is droll and insightful, Keaton takes the role and delivers the dialog with an understanding and wit it deserves.  Best scene (among many) is the play and NY Times worthy review of this sad educational warning.  Other highlights are the philosophical panderings (Keaton delivers these brilliantly with a subdued importance that parodies the importance of the content), which are delightful as intellectual stimulous as well as word play.  Maybe as funny a movie as has ever been made.  Well worth the time.
