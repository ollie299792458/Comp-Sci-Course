I love David Fincher. To me, there is nothing better, more exciting, visually interesting than a David Fincher film. He is a stylistically distinct and consistently innovative storyteller and filmmaker. Zodiac is David Fincher's sixth film and is the story of a cartoonist, a journalist, and a cop. It is not necessarily the story of the pursuit of a serial killer. It is more the story of the lives, careers, and marriages destroy by those obsessed by the pursuit of a serial killer. This is a serial killer movie devoid of chase scenes, shootouts, cliched confrontations and confessions. Jake Gyllenhal plays Robert Graysmith, a geeky guy who finds himself obsessed by the cryptic letters the Zodiac sends to the San Francisco Chronicle. The letters also intrigue rarely sober veteran crime reporter Paul Avery, played by Robert Downey Jr. Over the next several years, the two newspapermen and a San Francisco cop Nick Toschi, played by Mark Ruffalo, find their lives consumed by their efforts to determine the identity of the Zodiac. Zodiac isn't a typical serial killer movie in which the focus is on the blood and carnage. The focus here is on the lives of the people who are inadvertently touched by the killer. Fincher again proves himself a masterful filmmaker who has delivered a classic crime drama that unfolds slowly over the course of nearly three hours and refuses to pander to a bloodthirsty, attention-deficient audience.
