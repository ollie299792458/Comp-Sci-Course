First off, don't think I didn't like this movie from my 3 star rating. I did enjoy it.Now, with that out of the bag, The Funhouse is a great B-movie horror flick by Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre). It's somewhat dark  tone of the circus world is without a doubt creepy at best. (This is coming  from someone who hates clowns and the circus!) The lighting and angles  realy make the film work.It's pretty much the same premise as the good 'ol  80's horror movie. 2 boys and 2 girls want to have fun, so they decide to  sneak inside a funhouse to spend the night. One by one, they get axed. And  dare I say the ol' cliche'd "view through the mask" scene was  quite familier..(uh...Halloween? ).All in all, it's a fun movie to snuggle  up and turn the lights down on a rainy night. The only problem was the disk  itself. NO EXTRA'S!  Not even a trailor! Why?  The one good thing is, we  see it in the beauty of the 2.35:1 widescreen, which looks great.  Soundwise, it's decent. For true horror fans, pick up a copy.
