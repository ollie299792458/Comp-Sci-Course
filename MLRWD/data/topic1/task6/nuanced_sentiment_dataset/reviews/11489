It's difficult to know where to begin in critiquing this movie.  Perhaps its most glaring failing is its predictability.  It's a "thriller" that is completely lacking in suspense because the major plot twist is telegraphed within the first fifteen of the movie and painfully made increasingly obvious as the plot plods along.

And it does plod along, at a glacial pace that increasingly made me want to reach for the fast-forward button.  The cinematography and lighting are polished and intriguing, but the director is a little too in-love with them, and they become tedious after a while.

All of this could be forgiven if the characters were well-developed, but they are not.  At best, they are cardboard-caricatures placed in an unusual situation.  Considering the caliber of the actors, I can only assume that the fault lies with the script (the dialogue is spartan and unimaginative) and the director, who never really seems to want us to get to know them.

Even the brief, but explicit, sex scene between Seyfriend and Moore is not enough to gain this movie a second star.
