I'm not allowed to refer to another person's review here, but at the time of this writing, Amazon.com was posting a review of this movie that was clearly written by a person who was raised in Disneyland.  This is one of the best movies ever made.  Chicago Reader calls it an Acid Western and rates it "masterpiece".  It compromises to no filmmaking convention.  It's hardly possible to review it without giving away important aspects of the film the viewer should experience for her/himself.  The movie is not a story, even though it's told through a story.  The evolution of William Blake from innocent Cleveland accountant to a symbol (for English-educated Native American reject Nobody, played by Gary Farmer) for poetry itself; the tiny little worlds of late-19th-century white Western of-necessity survivalists, and the effects these little worlds had on Blake; the hilarious campfire scene with Iggy Pop and Billy Bob Thornton (and a third person -- can't find out who), and the dying beauty of the natives; the brutal innocence of the disenfranchised Nobody whose illusions (or were they?) propelled Blake to his -- future ... I was completely immersed.  There is only one thing wrong with this movie.  I love Neil Young, but, unless I'm missing some important symbolism, his score could have been more, well, varied.  There are not many movies I want to own but this is one.
