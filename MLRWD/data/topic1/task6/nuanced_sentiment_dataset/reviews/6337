Planet Earth has set the standard by which all nature documentaries will be judged for years to come. Although the Galapagos offers up some stunning scenes and footage of creatures not found in the Planet Earth series, it falls short of that high bar for a few reasons:

1) The content is not very rich: there is a lot repeated footage and narrative which makes everything feel stretched. Recreations of Darwin walking the islands as well as of whaling ships and pirates detract from the overall experience in my opinion.

2) Attention to detail and quality: There is some spectacular footage on the DVD, however, in comparison to Planet Earth there is a lot more mediocre content. I'm not sure whether the used different camera equipment or if it's just a poor transfer, but the image quality does not compare as well.

3) Lack of focus: The DVD is divided into three parts, yet I found myself wanting more detail at every stage. For example, the first part which starts by focusing on the formation of the islands geology seems to fizzle away from that and leaves it open and incomplete. For a documentary about the Galapagos I was disappointed I did not get more focused information about the Galapagos.

Despite it's short comings this is a great DVD for someone interested in seeing more of their home planet from an arm chair. But if you're only going to own one then buy Planet Earth - and if you're expecting the same level of detail and quality as Planet Earth - don't.
