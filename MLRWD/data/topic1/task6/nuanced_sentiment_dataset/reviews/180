Old and flabby Charlton Heston is trying to look sexy in this movie which artistic direction is just as flabby as the old Chuck.  There is always something exciting about post atomic situations when the hero is the last man on earth and is living besieged by creatures in a fortified luxurious apartment (thus the two stars).
The only problem in this movie is that the creatures are not so much creatures but men with a bad complexion in laughable middle-age frocks.  Therefore, it start to feel very strange that our hero is trying to exterminate people who talk like normal people, eat (junk) food like normal people, and who even have the feelings of regretting some of their own kind being killed by Chuck.  
It would be easy to say here that the NRA spokesman is just too happy to massacre all these unarmed poor souls (because on top of everything, these "creatures" are part of a sect which prohibits the use of firearms and other modern technologies which destroyed the earth).  In addition, the black woman of the movie is of course coming from Harlem (you know, that country in the North where all the black people come from) whereas Chuck is describing himself, in a scene when he is giving his blood which will save humanity, as pure Anglo-Saxon.  I will pass on the last scene when the Messiah who saved humanity (still Chuck) is symbolized by his US Army cap (like the saviours of humanity are our brave soldiers.  But did they not destroy it on the first place?).
Well, despite being laughable and ideologically stinky, it is still watchable on a rainy evening with your kids like a good old Starsky and Hutch episode.
