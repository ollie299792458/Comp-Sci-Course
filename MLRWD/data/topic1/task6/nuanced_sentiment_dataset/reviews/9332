It amazed me to see so many 1-star reviews for this film, so I thought I'd offer my two cents worth. "Young Adult" is not a rom-com. It's a cruel dark look at the life of an emotionally fractured person (Charlize Theron) who thought she had it all figured out in high school, only to be confronted with real life after graduation. I don't want to spoil the film for anyone but I will mention how heartbreaking it is to watch a person struggle beyond her means to even comfort herself. There is no transformation, no salvation, things do not get better. It is not hopeful, and does not pretend to leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling. Letting you off the hook at the end would insult the viewers as much as it would insult the honesty of the form in which the characters were written.

If you want to be entertained, anything Jennifer Anniston has produced would be able to amuse you without altering your sensibilities. However, if you want to see what happened to the prom queen and are prepared to watch a film that has the potential for testing your emotional response, you've come to the right place.

Bottom line: This film is unconventional and defies strict genre classification; it is not just a `black comedy', it is a `black comedy spending the holidays alone'. Having stated that, no film-lover should miss the performance Theron delivers, as well as the supporting cast - Patrick Wilson & Patton Oswalt.
