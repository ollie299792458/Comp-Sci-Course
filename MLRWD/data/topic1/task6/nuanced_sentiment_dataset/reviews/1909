I saw the play and the movie - and I enjoyed both - regardless of the reviews, I admire Tyler Perry for stepping out and doing it himself without the help of Hollywood.  He put his own money in the movie and the production, thank you Loin Gate Films for trusting him and getting it out to us - he filmed it at his house - all 16,000 sq.ft., in Atlanta.  He had great stars in it - and he went back to his play "Madea's Class Reunion" and picked from his cast some great singers, put them in the movie too.  This shows that he appreciated their hard work in his plays and their faithfulness.  With God guilding him through this process - Tyler's territory was enlarged greatly, the real people loved it came out on February 25th - that weekend and made it the #1 movie at $22.7 million.  I think coming from sleeping in his car (homelessness) to $22.7 million in 7 years is not a bad thing, regardless what the reviews say - they don't know everything and they don't know what people will spend their money to go see.  Tyler Perry has got my vote - I will go and spend my money on every movie he makes and every play he creates and I will buy all of them the right way - not bootleg.  Tyler, enjoy your life, love God and keep making movies for me and my mother to enjoy, forever.
