First of all, the movie is all downhill once the title is explained.  The fat sheriff points out that, "They were going to call it Lake Placid, but the name was taken."  So then we ask why you would call the movie Lake Placid?  I would much prefer Lake Dumb, it would more appropriately describe the sequence of events that follow.
Almost all dialogue between characters is completely ridiculous.  None of the characters seem to have any intelligence whatsoever.  Every character finds it necessary to use an excessive amount of sarcasm for every statement.  Perhaps the worst line of the movie comes from a supposed museum expert.  She says, "She's mooing."  This in reference to a cow, which seems completely ridiculous that a cow should ever moo at any point.  I now realize why she was so surprised.
So in the end, what we find is a bunch of crazy characters, many of which are eaten by a lake creature which turns out to be a giant 30 foot crocodile from Asia in a lake in Maine.  Some how the crocodile has managed to migrate that far and in turn reproduce with no mate.  It's simply a miraculous feat of nature.  Unfortunately, this movie would be better served cleaning up after people when nature calls than pointing out miracles of nature.
