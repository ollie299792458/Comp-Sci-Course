I originally saw this movie in the theater and was just really glad that my date (and not I) was paying of us to see it.  Boring, derivative, predictable.  The whole premise is bad to begin with.  If you're going to make a movie about people behaving badly (or isn't betraying your fiancee any big deal anymore?) then at least have the courage to let them actually behave badly.  No, this movie is all tame sexy (she gets drunk and rubs up against him like a cat in heat - he turns her down, (and my memory is fuzzy here) I think because she's drunk, not because of the nice girl he'll be marrying in a few days.  Or does she kick him out?  Who cares?  In real life if the man is on a date with another woman who knows his fiancee, he's certainly not going to turn into a gentleman at the last minute.  Everything in this movie is kind of half-hearted and weak, including the acting.

But this movie does get two stars.  You know why?  Do a web search on either star and look at them for a while.  An hour and a half of that is worth at least one star.
