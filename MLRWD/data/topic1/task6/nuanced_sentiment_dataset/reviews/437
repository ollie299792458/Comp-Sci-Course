I don't have the Criterion Collection DVD, but from all the reviews I've read it doesn't sound like that big a deal.  So for now I will watch my video tape, and maybe get the regular edition on DVD someday.  Robocop is such a great movie.  I saw Robocop 2 first at a drive-in movie theatre, I  guess it was the summer of 1990.  I have to admit, i didn't know about  Robocop and I wasn't too thrilled to go see 2, but my friends wanted to go,  so I went.  The good thing about the drive-in (which has since been torn  down, btw...last one in NY too I think) was that you could party in your  car, know what I mean?  Anyways, long story short, I LOVED Robocop 2!  LOVED IT!  So I went home and the next day I rented Robocop and I loved it  more than 2 and it was good to see Robocop to get the history in order.  I  love the humor, it is bleak and sarcastic.  The effects are amazing.  The  dingy, dirty look of the city.  It just feels so...tacky!  My boyfriend  thinks it is so funny that I am such a RObocop freak.  I recommend it to  everyone, I make my friends watch it if they haven't seen it.  I wonder,  are there any other female Robocop fans out there?  (...)
