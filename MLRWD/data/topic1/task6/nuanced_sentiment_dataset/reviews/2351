This movie, although I thought it was decently put together was nothing more than a historical disaster and a complete "slap in the face" to the people of Peru and of Central America.  The first 3 Indy movies had a lot more truth to them, as far as the regions they were shot in and said to be taking palce than the "Crystal Sull".  The myth of the Crystal Skulls is 100% in the Mayan culture of Central America, and in NO WAY made its way to the Inca who controlled the entire area of Peru, Chile, Equador and parts of Colombia...You do NOT go to Cuzco to get to Nazca...why would you go to a city that is 10,000 ft in the Andian Mountains to go to an area that is 4 hours south of lima, in the desert?  The places they went, the things they claimed were part of the "Crystal Skills" was nothing but pure stupidity.

For those who say a lot of the other Indy movies are far fetched...the Temple of Doom: there is evidence that native tribes of Peru did much of that was done in that movie... controlled people with the use of drugs, tearing peoples hearts out to appeal to the gods...things like that happened (although not with the bare hand).  This movie would have been MUCH better if they would have had SOME historical fact to it, other than the Crystal Skull themself.  They have been found, there are no "tool markings" on them and they are exact in every way to a human skull.  Key work phrase "humen skull", NOT an alien.

I just do not see how people can watch this movie, think it is an equal to the last 3 and think that a movie has no right to uphold some historical value and in the least should show respect to the cultures of the people of the country they film in.  I have many friends in Peru, and they all, as well and their friends are VERY angry about the way this movie was done and the things it claimed.
