Ahh, another movie build over a computer game, this one have to be good. We all still fondly remember a masterpiece like Streetfighter, that made us all dance with joy. And now comes Tombraider. A movie obviously tailored to profit from the success of the game. Angelina Jolies body is perfect cast in the role as Lara Croft, and I am sure that alot of teenage boys will agree with me on that one.
The story is about Lara who is going after some artifact that have been split in two, many centuries ago so it could not be used again(one have to wonder why they did not destroy it instead of using energy on building vast underground dungeons to place it in). Whoever holds this artifact got the power to control time. Her opposition are a group of bad guys called the Illuminati, that uses all means to get to the pieces before Lara.
The plot could have been taken from an old Indiana Jones script, although it is full of holes. The movie seem to take itself too seriously, and not much acting is actualy involved.
Tomb Raider seems to me like a (take-off) from Indiana Jones, but where Indiana Jones often handle situations with wit and charm and elegance, Lara usualy just pull out her twin-mounted automatics and blast the obstacle to pieces, which make the movie seem alot less charming and a lot less fun. But what do you expect from a movie build over a computer game. One have to wonder about how smart this Lara girl can really be since we see her wandering around an icy Siberian plain, in only hotpants and a tight t-shirt, or earlier when marching through a muddy field in a white trench coat. But I guess even tomb-raiders have to put more emphasis on the fashion trends and less on practical details these days.
The movie will most certainly be a hit, and I do admit that Jolies body looks fine in the role.
