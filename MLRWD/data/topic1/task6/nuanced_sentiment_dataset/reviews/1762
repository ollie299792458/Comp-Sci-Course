I couldn't finish this disc although I did get through three episodes.  The main reason I dig anime is for the fantastic artwork and stylistic animation.  I know this is a series of episodes and not a movie, but the action is very stilted.
In one scene when two characters are dueling with swords on top of a hill, their blades lock and they freeze-then there is a watercolor painting of the same scene while you hear the sound effects of swords clanging in the background.
Maybe I'm spoiled by other anime I've seen, but this is just not what I'm paying for.  I want to see actual frame by frame movement, not still frames with only a mouth moving on a character's face.  I know that anime has it's own tricks it employs and usually does so to great effect, but this looks lazy or rushed.  The poor overall presentation really distracts
from the story which is itself predictable and slow.
Two stars for the efforts of the dialogue team to put english voices to Berserk.  They at least breath some life into...but not much.
