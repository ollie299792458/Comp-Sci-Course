Theoreticians have determined that capital punishment is not a deterrent to crime.  I submit that if the convicted offender were locked away and required to view this movie once a day, for a year, it would be a fate worse than death.
This is one of the worse movies I have ever seen.  It makes Gigli look like a contender for best picture.  It is filled with long and boring scenes of personal introspection as the lead characters, one of whom is Matt Damon, stare endlessly into the desert wherein which they find themselves hopelessly lost. The dialogue, when there is any, is stilted and chopped.  It is, or so the producers would have you believe, filled with alleged wisdom and insight, as only those who are hopelessly lost in the desert can enjoy.  The opening scene, a long and tedious view of the desert expanse as seen through the windshield of a car, should have been a significant hint to the unwary viewer.
In conclusion, I didn't like this movie, as if, dear reader, you couldn't tell.  This film certainly has no social redeeming value, as I suspect the director and writers would have you believe.  In reality this movie has no value at all.
