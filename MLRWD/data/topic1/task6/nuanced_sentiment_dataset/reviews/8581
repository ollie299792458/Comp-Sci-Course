The trailor for "Wicker Park" would have you believe that this is a "Fatal Attraction" kind of film. A crazy stalker type who is obsessive from afar at first and then takes matters into her own hands, which is partly true of this film minus the intense climaxes, and endlessly deep characters.

The audience never really gets a feel for the true Matt (played by heart-throb Josh Hartnett) we don't connect with his background or his personality. The audience is just thrown into the middle of this chronilogically deficient love story, thats why we aren't too concerned with how hurt he is in the numerous scenes where he's left weeping.

The direction by Paul McGuigan is confusing and scattered. It didn't seem like he was sure of where he wanted to go with the film as judging by the complete disarray of the scene sequencing. The audience is left in a frustrating state of perplexity thoughout the entire film due to its constant flashbacks. Flashbacks are a technique often used to give background but mostly seen in a different cinematogaphy to differenciate their meaning, i.e. black and white or fast forwarding a narrated scene or slow motion with a previous monologue as used in classics like "Momento".

The inadequate soundtrack was best fit for a film with more intensity and detracked from what was actually appealing. Finally the only redeeming quality this film possesses is its impeccable choice of casting for the part of Luke, Matt's best friend, played by the always reliable Matthew Lillard, who gave his usual comic relief perfomance and yet captured the audience with his schoolboy charm.
