This is a simple story of a country youth trying to survive in the new China with little more than determination and hard work.  At the end of the film you get the impression that Director Wang Xiaoshaui's verdict is that this is not nearly enough in a fast changing modern China and I'm not sure that he's incorrect.

The film itself is enjoying although the style is derivative.  The film has a quasi-documentary feel because of the lack of name actors recognizable to Western audience.  The denouement is unsatififying and leaves me wanting more in terms of resolution, although I do not normally consider such de reguer in a movie.

In the end, one can view the film as a snapshot of the modern youths of China if so inclined, as the director may have intended it to be.  But it lacks depth viewed in this context and the theme could have been developed with more subtlety and nuance.  That said, I do look forward to Wang's next effort in the hope that he can find his own voice.
