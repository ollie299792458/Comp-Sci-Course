This is one of the most articulate documentaries ever produced. There are some who suggest the archives are slanted simply because Yoko Ono was a primary source of those archives, yet it stands to reason that the woman who shared his bed, raised his child, recorded music with him, and in many respects fought the world with John would be in a better position than most to portray Lennon accurately - and as he would have wished. The Imagine video rings with authenticity, affection, rebellion, resolution, bitterness, and biting humor - qualities Lennon was famous (and controversial) for. I have always been impressed with the movie for a personal reason... I marvel that the famous and controversial woman, the wife of a pop-icon and trend-setter, somehow had the strength to persevere against great social resistance in order to collaborate with her husband's former wife, and son by a previous marriage. In an age of "equal time" for multi-marriage families, Yoko's generosity was extraordinary. Cynthia Lennon, too, is to be commended for her candidness and perception. The movie is ultimately fair. Bitterness is mitigated by humility, and forgiveness is engendered by the ability to "let go." John &amp; Yoko made mistakes, together and separately, but both, I think, would plead for tolerance, as they expressed for others. Yoko's final comment in the movie is the she and John had fought in a war together, for peace, and for acceptance, for themselves and for others. This is the driving influence behind "Imagine"... not exploitation, but about a re-release of private revelations regarding a public entity who sacrificed his own privacy to be a voice for the people. Lennon spent the latter half of his lifetime fighting his own fears, and the rabid paranoia of the cultures around him. He won. We still remember, and we imagine.
