Imagine if a company made a film about why it was a good thing that fugitive American slaves were captured and whipped--something like The Birth of a Nation, with the KKK as heroes, but a film that advocated and depicted brutal violence against what history clearly shows were victims of oppression.  Enter Black Death, a movie that takes all of the religious gobbledygook that served as reasons to torture and murder women accused of being witches in the Middle Ages and defends it with an absurd story that suggests (albeit as a fiction) that there WERE enclaves of evil witches who would torture and murder the servants of God--something for which there is absolutely no evidence in history.  This film takes the victims of a state-sponsored crime and makes them deserving of the crime, justifies the misdeeds of the perpetrators, and then cloaks it all in theological bull puckey about how devout the murderers and torturers are--they're the REAL victims here, the holy martyrs true to their faith, not the thousands of innocent women the church slaughtered.  This film, regardless of its nice cinematography and good performances, cannot be excused for rewriting history in the most deplorable way, even if one argues that it's just a premise for a horror story.
