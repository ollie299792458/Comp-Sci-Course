Hey folks, don't get me wrong, I love Rodney Yee, but if you are relatively new to yoga this video is probably not for you.  I am not a raw beginner, I know a lot of poses, have attended a few classes, etc. I got this video because I have used Rodney's AM/PM Yoga for Beginners with Patricia Walden.  I only ever did the A.M. portion with Rodney as I personally find Patricia annoying.  However, the section that I did was actually a bit too easy for me.  So, I went on the hunt for something else.

This video appealed to me partly because it's for 5 days of the week, the workouts are pretty short (I like to do yoga and then something else or vice versa), I liked that it focused on part of the body each day, and it said GENTLE ENOUGH FOR BEGINNERS.  I find this to be a big fatty lie.  As other reviewers have noted, particularly for the morning, it's fairly intense.  There is no warm-up or meditation, it launches straight into the practice.  Part of the reason I do yoga is because my flexibility is terrible.  This video moves quite quickly, and while I do enjoy a challenge, I need to know modifications on poses. This video offers no modifications - except periodically to tell you you can use a strap which I usually knew already anyway.  Fortunately, I have Rodney Yee's book 'Moving Towards Balance' which shoes poses and their variations so I could pause and look stuff up.  However, had this not been the case I probably would have given up on the video.

Also, the backbend section of the video - I could easily see someone hurting themselves with this if their abdominal muscles are not strong enough to adequately support their back.

I give this 3 stars largely for just the kind of false advertising.  I just don't think it's a good choice for a lot of beginners.  I think if I was further along in my practice I would probably enjoy it.
