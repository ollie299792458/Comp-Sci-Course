First of all I must say i have loved this movie ever since it was released back in 1977. Second, I am disappointed in Universal's re release of this classic. I have Anchor Bay's version of this classic, and it is a great version. The problem i have with this re-release is the fact that they seem to have forgotten to put in some of the sound effects on the audio track on the disc. The remastered picture quality is better on the Universal release, than on the Anchor Bay version, but the lack of the sound effects leaves something to be desired. When the car is in the garage with James Brolin, revving the motor and trying to kill him, there are no screams or dialog, with Margie or the kids screaming. Yet if you switch the audio to the French version, the dialog is there, I just dont get it. Personally, i would save the money if you already have the Anchor Bay version, I am also disappointed that this being a Universal release, that there was nothing hiding in the Universal vaults, like added footage, or any bonus material. This just seems like another attempt to re-release something just to make a quick buck, Please Please try to improve on these in the future. Thanks
