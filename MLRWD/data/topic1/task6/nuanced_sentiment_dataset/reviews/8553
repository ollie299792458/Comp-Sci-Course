Ben Stiller did an excellent double-role as a determined dad and a museum night guard in this adventurous film about a museum that comes to life every night. My favorite character is the Easter Island Head because of the way he rhymes his words in a James Earl Jones-like voice:("You new dum-dum. You give me gum gum.") In addition, Robin Williams gives a great portrayal of Theodore Roosevelt that you can't even tell it's Robin. He serves as Larry's pointer of advice, despite the fact that he calls him Lawrence. Rex the dinosaur skeleton, is a creature that will have both young and old laughing their socks off, while Dexter the capuchin monkey always gives Stiller a hard time by stealing his keys again and again. Several artifacts actually exit the museum, which causes chaos. But despite the commotion, Ben eventually realizes that it is his job to keep everything in the museum, thanks to the help of Egyptian pharoah Akmenrah. The second disc informs viewers about how the movie was made, the characters' roles and why they were chosen, hilarious outtakes, trailers and even an interview with Stiller and the film's director Sean Levy that makes this two DVD set worth having.
