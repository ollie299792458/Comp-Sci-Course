I was surprised at the ending of this film that I didn't see the above caption at the beginning of the film. This movie to me was comparable to American television movies where something terrible happens to a family and how they cope with it. It was an Italian film, but on the whole it was of the same viewing quality as these movies, maybe a little less slick in appearance.

Also some of the scenes were so banal. Like just before the boy drowns a sense of danger is created by the girl on the moped kicking one of her friends on another moped, the close passing of a truck as the father drives to his patient etc. Or when the boys' casket is nailed shut and is screwed shut interchanged with images of the mourning father. How fat can you lay it on?

Especially the beginning of the movie is excruciating. A very one-dimensional portrait of the family, if they were black, they would be called the Huxtables. This is of course to offset the second part of the movie with the first. First routine and happiness, the second chaos and sadness.

The above are just some things I noticed about the movie which didn't make sense to me. I won't even go into the storyline which is rather unplausible at some points even though it is completely predictable. What bothers me most though is that all of this must have been done on purpose, but why? The end result is a bland film which may have been made with a lot of care, but just doesn't come across. This is the first movie I have seen by this director. I have heard that his other movies are better. I hope so, because this film hasn't made a great impression on me.
