TRICK is a delicious, delightful farce-romantic comedy that came out of nowhere to be a film to be cherished.  The trick, here, are the extraordinary performances of John Paul Pitoc and Christian Campbell who play two gay young men who meet with lust on their minds...and whose characters grow into warm and sensitive ones.  TRICK carries the unique ability of creating a fine love story without the usual angst of gay love stories. Campbell has a winning personality and a gift for comedy, and PITOC gives a career boosting performance. Pitoc has the rare  acting skill of being able to say nothing...and still conveying the growth of a character.  He is a find!!  The supporting cast is likewise excellent.  The story revolves around two young men whose meeting leads to a series of zany and bizarre events that prevent any chance of their being alone.  Tori Spelling is surprisingly good as Campbell's ditsy, no-talent off-off Broadway actress-singer friend.  TRICK is a welcome breath of romantic comedy.... and its charm will be felt by everyone regardless of sexual preferences.  Out of the blue comes TRICK...and don't miss it !
