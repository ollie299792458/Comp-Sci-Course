HAHAHA this movie is simply laughable!! i could sit here all day and tell u about all of the funny parts but i would be here to long! This movie was stretched out as far as a horror movie could go and u could def. tell that they tried wayyyyy to hard to make it scary witch, therefore made it non scary and laughable at! It was also the most predictable movie of the year(and the year isent even half over yet u can just tell these kind of things!) me and my friend were sitting in the theatres laughing the whole time and telling eachother wat was going to happene around every twist and turn....and u know wat? we were always right! U can also tell that when the DVD comes out its going to have all these special features like-cast and bio, commentary by directore, makeup, legacy of the tooth fairy, legacy of darkness falls, deleted  and extended scenes, making of, its going to have everything just as a last resort to get u to buy this. so all in all this movie was pretty bad and i wouldent spend the 20 dollars on the DVD i would, at the most extreme rent it so i can have something to laugh at.
