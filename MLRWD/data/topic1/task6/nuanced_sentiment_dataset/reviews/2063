The very first time I saw SILVERADO I knew it was great.  Some of my most favorite actors are in this film.  Men who can make you feel you're a part of the movie.  Men like Brian Dennehe, Kevin Cline, Scott Glen, Jeff Goldbloom, Danny Glover, Kevin Costner, and others of their caliber.  What an awesome film.  I've always enjoyed a quick draw character with a brain, and a master slueth smarter than the corrupt sherif, and a good plot to go with it all.  Of course the ever voluptuous Rosanna Arquette is the girl most every one is ever after, almost in any movie.  This film has it all.

THE QUICK AND THE DEAD.  What can I say, it's all about the quick draw with more of my favorit actors. Russell Crowe, Leonardo Dicaprio, and Gene Hackman who by the way, plays an excellant bad guy in most of his movies, I do believe.  Then the gorgeous Sharon Stone is a must for this movie, probably before Hollywood even came up with the idea of The Quick and the Dead.  I puchased both of these dvd's at Amazon.com
