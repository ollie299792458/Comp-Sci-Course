"Waking Life" is probably not like any other film you've seen before: the majority of it consists of philosophical monologues that express different perspectives on the loosely connected ideas which the main character is trying to explore. On the whole, these monologues range from the fascinating to the obnoxiously trite, and even though this film expresses some wonderful concepts, it also manages to present the cliche ideas in a completely serious fashion.

Having said that though, "Waking Life" is still a unique cinematic experience worth watching. Even though the plot line has very little continuity, it's the ideas that really matter. In some ways, the main character is almost irrelevant; it's not so much about him discovering these concepts as it is about us discovering them. Unfortunately though, at times the philosophical monologues are thrown at us in such a haphazard manner that we have very little time to absorb, much less intellectualize them. Although many scenes are truly valuable, others are just jarring or distracting (for instance, in one scene a stranger walks past the main character and simply says, "Kierkegaard's last words were, 'Sweep me up'!").

On the other hand though, I feel like in a way we are meant to be confused, just as the main character is. The animation technique is certainly a good choice for this effect, and is very well-done. Another very positive aspect of this film is the soundtrack, which is superb. Overall, I think this is a pretty decent film, even if its moments of brilliance are broken up by waves of generic pop philosophy.
