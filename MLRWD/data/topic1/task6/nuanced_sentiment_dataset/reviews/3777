This movie has a lot going for it: good actors (Jennifer Ehle is fantastic), good cinematography, and good music.  So why was I dissatisfied when the movie ended.  Let me count the ways while trying not to reveal the (surprise?) ending: plot lines never resolved, e.g. smudged photos; silly scenes such as the girlfriend shearing off her beautiful long hair and swimming down a river (usually she uses the much cleaner school pool) to no purpose except somehow to bond with her dead non-lover who drowned in that very same river; trite scene in which good cop (Edward Burns) turns in his badge and gun (don't all good movie cops do this sooner or later?); previously secret lovers openly smooching with muted reckless abandon at a very public school gathering; mood music growing toward a climax that seems only to be signaled by the credits.
After watching the movie I discovered that it was based a book by Alice Hoffman, author of the execrable "Here on Earth"  (see my review "Morbid, Depressing & Pointless.")  Since Ms. Hoffman doesn't burden herself with such niceties as character development and motivation, this movie is right in synch with her style.  The secret to enjoying The River King is to allow yourself to drift along with the moods and enjoy the wintry cinematography without thinking or expecting too much.
