I watched the trailers for this movie, and instantly I was in love. Sadly, that feeling didn't last very long. Now I'm not saying this movie was terrible, but it also didn't rise to meet my expectations. On the plus side "The vow" had likable characters, a solid plot, and AMAZING chemistry between Tatum and McAdam's. Aside from those positive points I was still disappointed.

The first half of the movie pulled me. I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed the romance between them. A big plus were the flashbacks, I felt that it showed the TRUE love between the couple.

The second half is where the disappointment started. For a long period of time the movie was basically at a stand-still, you didn't know what was going to happen to the couple. Would they stay together, split up, would she ever remember? Then, after all the back and forward between them, the movie just comes to an end. It happens unexpectedly, and basically leaves a lot of unanswered questions.

Basically this movie had the makings of an everlasting love story, but fell short somewhere during the second half. Although, it wasn't one of my favorites, everyone should be the judge for themselves.
