Having never heard of this movie, I rented it based on the acting talent. I didn't know what it was about or heard any reviews so didn't expect anything, really. Liam Neeson plays a funeral director who has a "gift" of being able to speak to the newly dead. Christina Ricci is his latest "body", Justin Long her boyfriend with whom she's having trouble. After a fight, Ricci is involved in a car accident and finds her on the slab at Neesons funeral home.

The twist is that you really don't know if Ricci is alive or dead. Neeson plays a lovely balance of creepy and endearing making you second guess what is going on right to the end of the movie. It's nice to see Long as a character totally different than what he usually plays, and he plays it very convincingly. Ricci plays pretty much the same character she always does, her acting range isn't very wide in my personal opinion, but I enjoyed her performance all the same. Her look and style are perfect for this genre.

There is quite a lot of nudity in it, but honestly, I was surpirsed there wasn't more seeing as she is supposedly a dead body getting ready for burial.

Is it the best thriller out there, no. Is it perfect? No. But it was surprising in its ability to give you enough clues to keep you guessing but not give away the ending.
