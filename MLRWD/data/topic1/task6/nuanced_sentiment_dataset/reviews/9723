First let me start by saying you can avoid this title "The Clone Wars" (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTSCZI">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a>) altogether and instead watch the 2003 series "Clone Wars vol 1"" (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006Z2LMO">Star Wars - Clone Wars, Vol. 1</a>) and "Clone Wars vol 1"" (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BCE8Q4">Star Wars - Clone Wars, Vol. 2</a>).  Note there is bound to be confusion between the former and latter considering the only difference in title seems to be the work "The", and this it seems is exactly what Lucas is counting on.  In the remainder of this review I will refer to the work reviewed here as "TCW", and the superior  2003 series as "CW".

CW was an engaging series of cartoons shown on Cartoon Network.  The writers were given great freedom to work with the characters and universe to produce a work reminiscent of the original Star Wars Movie.  Specifically the stories were clean and straightforward, and the action was intense and well choreographed...in other words CW was fun!  Specifically lacking from CW were drawn out exposition of complicated political sub-plots, and wooden "romantic" dialogue between Anakin and Padme.  Now contrast this with the current work TCW.  The dialog is wooden, the action is repetitive and boring, and the storytelling is not engaging.  The final death blow for TCW is the introduction of side-kick character Ahsoka Tano whose inanity and banality rivals that of Jar Jar Binks.

In summary, stay away from "The Clone Wars", enjoy the 2003 series "Clone Wars"
