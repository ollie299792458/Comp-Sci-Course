"CSI: Miami" is a good show with a lot of problems that could and should be easily solved.
First of all, the characters are never really as defined as the ones on "CSI." 
Secondly, the show occasionally veers away from the mystery/whodunnit format of "CSI" and becomes a cop show with a dab of science thrown in. 
Another standard, un-"CSI"-like plot line has Horatio Caine disliking a suspect and spending the rest of the show finding evidence to convict him/her. When there's a twist and a 2nd suspect emerges that Caine doesn't like, I find myself not liking Caine. 
A third problem is David Caruso and his character. Horatio Caine is someone trying to be cool but isn't. His brooding is excessive, and his constant staring off into space is predictable.
Then there's David Caruso's inability to find a place for his hands. He's constantly putting them on his hips or putting on/taking off his sunglasses. After about 5 episodes, this gets alternately annoying and hilarious.
Another aspect of Horatio Caine is his repetitious dialogue. There are shows where his lines are exactly the same as in last week's show. For example, he's constantly saying, "OK, this is what we're going to do."  
As for the episodes on these disks, there are additional problems. 
Beautiful Emily Procter is a little too made up. 
The shows on these disks include the episodes with Kim Delaney, who didn't fit in and was totally unconvincing as a crime scene investigator. The show improved immensely when she left.
I don't mind these problems when "CSI: Miami" can present you with a good plot twist, poignant story, or last-minute piece of esoteric evidence. But when it fails to deliver, which, during the 1st season, was about every 3rd or 4th episode, the problems become obvious, and the show becomes uninteresting and campy.
