or I might be so pissed off at PT Anderson for releasing this version that I might stop watching his movies.  But I am a PT Anderson fan, and while he may have to change his act somewhat after 'Magnolia' to maintain a sizable audience, you can still hark back to the good old days in 1997 when 'Boogie Nights' was first released with this superb New Line Platinum Series Two Disc DVD. Back when Mark Wahlberg wasn't the star of every other movie released,before Juliane Moore became Hannibal's love interest, when Burt Reynolds looked like he might have a future. 'Boogie Nights' dances from one dazzling sequence to another (the party scenes at the beginning of the movie are my favorite), we periodically check in on all the characters, and their lives in and out (no pun intended) of the underground world of pornography.
Then apropriately, the eighties begin, and it all starts to get nasty- the advance of videotape threatens to cheapen the sex industry, Wahlberg and buddies begin doing too much coke to perform on camera, and ego and greed finally begin their long downward spiral.
Great director/cast commentary and extras, (there are enough deleted scenes to cut another movie with) make this a must have for those who didn't already invest (money) in this DVD.
