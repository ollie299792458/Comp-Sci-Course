This forgotten drama depicting a conspiracy behind the assassination in Dallas covers some of the same ground as Oliver Stone's J.F.K, but seems to have elicited none of the hysterical controversy, perhaps as it was released to a jaded post-Watergate audience.  We see the famed image of Oswald with his rile being created in a sequence that definitely foreshadows one of the best parts of Stone's film.  There are also similar scenes of Oswald being set up around Dallas as a patsy.  (Stone may have learned what to avoid when studying this picture as well.  His theories about Oswald work better when our frame of reference is an actor in the role. Here we see so much footage of the real Oswald it's easy to buy him as a lone nut.) Unfortunately, much of the rest of this picture is taken up with target practice and about a full third is the main characters watching images of the President on T.V.

What's most remarkable though is the completely un-ironic manner in which the right-wing conspirators are played. They could be the local Chamber of Commerce or the leads on a network lawyer show from the 70s. There's nothing menacing about them and they're allowed no pat commentary or agonizing about what they're doing. In fact, when Robert Ryan discusses his racist theories he sounds like he could be amiably plugging a book on Fox News.  (Stone would never withhold judgement like that. Similar characters are portayed as so evil they give even Nixon the creeps in Nixon.)

The lone extra is a documentary around the time of the film's making where the filmmakers discuss what they're doing in kind of lofty terms.  (This is punctuated by bracing insights from Ryan.)
