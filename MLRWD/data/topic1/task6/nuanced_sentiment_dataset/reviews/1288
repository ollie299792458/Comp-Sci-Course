I am an animation buff so I'm happy to see these on video finally. A bit of history. Cartoons that pre-date ol' Mickey.

But I'm also a huge football fan and I just wanted to tell you a bit of trivia about this. When Monday Night Football left ABC and went to ESPN last year and became a so-so match-up, NBC was awarded the marquee game of the week for its Sunday Night Football. Naturally NBC wanted to keep the Monday Night "feel" with the hosts John Madden and Al Michaels. They got Madden but Michaels was under contract to ABC.

So where am I going with all this? Well Disney owns ABC (and ESPN). And NBC owns Universal. And Uncle Walt made Oswald for Universal back in the 1920's and when he left to start his own studio, he couldn't take Oswald with him. Essentially Mickey was a clone of Oswald.

And for 80 years Disney has wanted them back. So when NBC came to ABC about getting Al Michaels for Sunday Night Football, a deal was struck. "You can have Michaels if we can have Oswald."

Some might be offended or shocked by this unlikely trade but both made off pretty well. I would estimate these cartoons are priceless in the eyes of Disney but they'll still generate millions in revenue. And so will Sunday Night Football for NBC.
