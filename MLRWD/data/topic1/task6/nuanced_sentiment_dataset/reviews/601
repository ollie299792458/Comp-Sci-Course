I saw this movie when I was about ten years old and it scared the hell out of me. I saw it agian about a year ago and it is in the top ten of the worst films of all time. As a kid I loved all the nudity and gore. Now it's is really tedious.
 The story is about a killer who escapes from a mental hospital and finds a bunch of girls at a slumber party. Befor getting there he kills a few people.
 First the killer is using a long wall drill that turns very slowly but somehow can slice threw people like a knife. The killer is a short man no more that five five and all of one hundred and twenty pound holding a brick. He is as far from scary as you can get. Forget the fact that every horror movie antic is used in this film, like never calling the police,or leaving the party in a group,tripping women, dead flashlights and the ever popular "Let's split up.
I am not one to look for 5 star movies all the time and I can enjoy a good slasher film but this one really tests even the most staunch supporter of slasher films. I do wonder who was there movie aimed at? I know that anyone over the age of fourteen will find this to be a foolish film and under that age should not be watching an R rated movie anyway.
Of course this movie is not a new idea and really started with Halloween where a mental patiant escapes from and institution and goes on a rampage. That however was a better film
This movie is good for one thing however. If you are looking for a movie to watch with buddies, or at a party just to laugh at than you should look no further. You have found you'r waste of film......
