Okay, so the documentary is unusually good. The only problem is that the only cast member is Anna Falchi, who somehow looks even better than she did during the film. And she's wearing little make-up and has regular-sized lips! What? Where is Rupert and Gnagi? I'd love to know what Gnagi is up to!

It was nice to see Michele Soavi and learn more about him - he's not an easy fellow to research in the states.

The transfer is really nice, however, some shots are wicked grainy. The first pull out from the skull comes to mind. Other shots are clean as a can be on DVD, which means they must be source-based issues.

They also used the American "Cemetery Man" titles on the print, which is fine. It would have been a neat extra to have the Italian titles, as well.

There's some other features, like the original making-of, that aren't here, which is a bummer.

But, in all truth, it is a pleasure to finally have this in a good, legitamate US DVD. The booklet that comes with it is great - although it repeats a lot of information from the documentary.

Also, no subtitles! How weird is that?

In all honesty, fans of the film will always want MORE - but hey - Anchor Bay, thank you for this!
