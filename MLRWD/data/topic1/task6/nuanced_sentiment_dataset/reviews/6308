This is an odd film which appears to attempt to turn a rather flawed human being -- an unstable liar and cheat -- into a hero.  I can appreciate the fact that Donald Crowhurst's family want to think well of him, but the film makers really owe us a more balanced picture.  The film says at one point that Crowhurst had tried other careers, but it doesn't tell us that he was asked to resign from both the RAF and the Royal Army for conduct unbecoming, etc. He was a man who never really grew up, and to say that he was a player of games as an excuse for what he did (attempting to fake a voyage around the world) really doesn't excuse his basic dishonesty.  A classical hero is a good and great man with a single flaw.  Crowhurst was a weak and flawed man with a few good qualities (he appears to have loved his wife and children).  Paranoid Schizophrenia (which reading Crowhurst's logs clearly reveals) is not, I believe, something that happens to a person who is psychologically reasonably strong.  So trying to present Crowhurst as a sort of hero is, at best odd, at worst a misrepresentation.  Far more interesting to me are the brief bits in the extras sections about Robin Knox Johnson and my own favorite, Bill King.  Buy the film if you can find a cheap copy; it's rather nicely edited; but beware of an odd agenda running throughout.
