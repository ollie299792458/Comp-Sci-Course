This movie is amazing. I'm against the slaughter of whales, dolphins, and porpoises completely.

But I think it should be made clear that this movie lies to all of its viewers. Places like SeaWorld have nothing to do with this slaughter. Captivity is not the reason why Taiji slaughters dolphins. The reason is simple: pest control. The man who made this movie, Ric O'Barry, is very anti-captivity. He has had revenge on captivity since he was denied a training position in the late '80s. Instead of blaming the slaughter on the real cause - pest control, he blames it on places like SeaWorld. Which is false.

If you don't believe me, I suggest you YouTube search "Dolphin Show = Dolphin Kill? An Investigation of The Cove Part 1"

This 'documentary' is good, but it fails to tell people how we can all work together to stop the horrid dolphin slaughter. Instead, Ric O'Barry exploits the dolphin slaughter to make people boycott SeaWorld.

The good news, you can still visit dolphin shows! The bad news? The only way the dolphin slaughter will end is if the Japanese boycott seafood. Dolphins are killed because the dolphins eat the fish the Japanese fishermen catch. We need the Japanese people to speak out! This movie does not give you a real answer, it just LIES to you.
