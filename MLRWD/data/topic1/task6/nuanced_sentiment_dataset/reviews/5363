Just terrific! I loved this movie when I first saw it on TV, just bought the DVD and it's even better, since you get to see the whole movie with nothing snipped to make room for commercials -- and of course the video quality is better than TV.

The disc is double-sided, full screen on side A and widescreen on side B.

Some reviewers here have complained bitterly that it isn't really widescreen, it's just "pan and scan" with the top and bottom cut off. That isn't true. Yes, the widescreen version is the same as the full screen version but with the top and bottom of the frame cut off -- that's the way many widescreen movies WERE MADE, folks! For example, ALL of Stanley Kubrick's movies after "2001: A Space Odyssey" were made this way. It isn't pan and scan. You're not missing any part of the original, you're seeing the full frame as it was before it was matted for theatrical showing.

It's the same as the "panorama" feature in many point-and-shoot 35mm cameras. The "panorama" mode doesn't really give you a wider angle of view, it just looks wider because the top and bottom have been cropped off and the photo is then printed on paper with a wider aspect ratio.

Not all widescreen movies are made this way, of course. But DVDs that are widescreen on one side and full screen on the other are usually if not always this way in my experience. "The Searchers" is another example. Compare the widescreen and full screen sides and you'll see the full screen side is really just as wide in angle of view, it just shows more of the top and bottom that you never saw in a theatrical showing because it was matted out.
