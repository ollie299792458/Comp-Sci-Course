I know I am kicking a sacred cow when I say this, but the preaching and pontificating in this film went on and on.
There were many good moments, but Network seemed never to end. When Faye Dunaway's character would not stop talking about the show, while walking with William Holden, while eating with Holden, and even before, during, and after sex with Holden, I wanted him to tell her to "Shut the Hell up!"

This is a classic film for its time, and I liked it when I first saw it, but now, in 2009, seeing it again made me want to say, "Do something, if you are mad as Hell."  Sticking heads out of windows and yelling about one's angst just unifies everyone in his angst. What if we all stuck our heads out windows and yelled,m "I'm thankful to be here, and if there is anything you need, just call me."? That's a good thing. The film got a response out of me.

I know this is a satire on the power of the media and its negativity. I was raised during the era it depicts. Walter Cronkite (his photo featured in the film) is one of my heroes. I thought that Face in The Crowd and Quiz Show were more entertaining.

I was considering showing this film to my English classes, but I am afraid they would be bored, and that I would lose them. I just wish there were more story and fewer long meetings, discussions about the meaning of media, and repetition.

Maybe I will change my mind upon another viewing, but that will not happen soon.
