First off, this is an easy movie to criticize. Most small budget horror flicks are. I mean, really, how much can a director do in a dimly lit parking ramp? Quite a bit, I found. Don't over-analyze and you're in for a good time.

This is the type of fun romp that originally got me interested in the genre while I was growing up in the '80s. There's no overly complex plot, amazing effects or numbing backstory here - just a psychotic guard, a mean dog, a killer Cutlass, a busty blonde, the chase and 85 minutes of run time. Think of it as Duel confined to an underground ramp and you pretty much have the basic concept. Convincing and talented performances by the two leads are just icing on the cake.

Obviously meant for a Christmas release (I can't find the reason why it was pushed back 11 months or pulled 1 ahead), this movie was rushed out of most Minneapolis-area theatres the week following its arrival. I had to scramble just to catch it on the big screen a second time. Yes, it's that good. In fact, I'd put it right up there with Grindhouse and 28 Weeks Later as one of the best horror releases of 2007. The blood splattered image of a hip-swivelling Wes Bentley miming "Blue Christmas" into a mop handle alone is worth the price of admission.
