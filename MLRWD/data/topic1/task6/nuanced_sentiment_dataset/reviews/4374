ZOOLANDER is the greatest movie ever made.  It was, and is, so far ahead of its time that it's no wonder the American public was unable to appreciate it during its theatre run.  Zoolander's epic journey through self-discovery and actualization should serve as a lesson for us all that really, really, really good looking people can have a hard time in life as well - even though they will eventually triumph.  
Some people, all of whom are ugly, say that Zoolander is somehow lacking as a film.  These ugly people are unable to surrender themselves to the magical glory of this fine art.  Naturally, this is another instance in which ugly people are so very wrong; as ugly people so often are.  People who don't enjoy Zoolander are also not fully developed personalities, and are clearly jealous.  Of Zoolander.  Or Hansel.
I urge you to buy this movie.  Not only will you be supporting the arts in general, but you'll be supporting the really, really, really good looking people with perfect body structure and chisled abs and thick hair who may not have it as easy as you imagine they do.
