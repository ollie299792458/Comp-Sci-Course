I really tried to watch this movie with an open mind, and tried really hard NOT to compare it to Jesus Christ Superstar.  
I found it VERY dated.  The costumes were freaky.  I'm sorry, Jesus Christ was scary-looking.  A guy in a 'fro with a Superman shirt?  I'm not sure what they were trying to do with this.  Were they trying to make him seem more human and approachable?  I think I'd run the other way.  
The setting was fine.  Walking around NYC seemed fine, not at all dated.  In fact, the city is probably the ONLY thing that isn't dated.  
The tunes were acceptable and catchy.  Some of the lyrics were less than...imaginative.  The crucifixion scene was laughable.  Not because of the "chain link fence crucifixion," but because of the singing (Oh God, I'm dying!.... Oh God, you're dying!)!!! That seemed very...forced and totally fake.  
I wonder if I would feel differently if Godspell was updated and re-done.  New interpretations do wonders to aged musicals.  Come to think of it, I DID see this performed by a high school years ago.  They updated it and used modern clothes.  I remember thinking it was excellent and wanted to see it again.  
Overall, I did not feel particularly touched by this movie.  I did not think that Christ was any more tangible.  On it's own, I'd say it was "decent, though dated."  But then comes the inevitable comparison: Jesus Christ Superstar.  At least with that musical, it was written from Judas Iscariot's viewpoint.  It took some creativity as opposed to taking passages right out of Matthew and sticking them between songs.  
While the 1973 Superstar movie is dated as well, the 2000 version with Glenn Carter is much better.  Give it a shot!
