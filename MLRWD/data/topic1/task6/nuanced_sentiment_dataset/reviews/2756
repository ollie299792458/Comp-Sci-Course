When I rented this movie I thought I was in for a comedy treat but having watched I know why it's not been out too often!
The film starts off fairly slowly and doesn't have too many funny parts, I'll admit that there are some laughs but nothing that I could really pick out as being memorable.
The fun only starts when Jim's other personality comes out and he begins to interact with the other people. My personal highlight is after he confronts the mom and he's driving back, if you've seen the film you know what I mean.
Once he is ordered to escort the prisoner the jokes start to fall a little flat and you are wanting the evil personality to come back to inject some much needed comedy into the film. The film trundles along to the obvious climactic finish but we have to suffer the obvious fight between the good and bad personalities which might have been good apart from the feeling of Jim milking it for all it's worth.
I found the film to be a little muddled and by the end of the film I was wanting to see more of the evil personality as Jim was excellent with that part of the role. The less said about the three sons the better. I'm sure they were very funny for some people but I found it hard to understand what they were saying sometimes as their dialogue was very fast.
I would say that this isn't one of Jim Carrey's better films but if you are a fan of Jim then I'm sure you will enjoy it. I've given this film 2 stars because without the evil character it would only deserve 1.
