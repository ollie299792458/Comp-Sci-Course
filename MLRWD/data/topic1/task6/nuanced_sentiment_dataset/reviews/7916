Rocked! Totally rocked! I love any movie that can give me a great visual representation of the gulf that separates mass humanity from the isolation of a few survivors. Especially if NYC is the setting. Nothing to me is a more potent display of this than a deserted NYC.

It's foolish to directly compare this to The Omega Man or the Vincent Price version. This was a rendition of the tale shaped to fit our times.

Will Smith showed the most depth as a character that I've ever seen from him. He did a great job depicting how one might feel and act in that situation. He lost all, he's totally alone, he's up against unstoppable forces knowing help will never come, but he feels compelled to do the right thing and keep on fighting. As a Marine, I can severely appreciate that!

Special effects were outstanding. I'm a big, big fan of the whole "one man against all odds" theme and this was a powerful example of that. Even the animated shorts in the special features were mind blowing. If anything, they were even more intense. Great DVD!
