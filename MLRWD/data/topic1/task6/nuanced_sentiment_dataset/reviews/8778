This isn't just an updated Carrie. In fact Carrie isn't in this film! And the young woman isn't her daughter but half sister. As you may know, Ralph White left Carrie's mother. Rachel the telekinetic teen in this film is his daughter. Her mother is schizophrenic. Seems our pal Ralph loves mentally disturbed women and then leaves them. In this movie, Rachel has more going for her ona stable psychological level then Carrie.

She is taken from her mom at a young age, and raised with foster parents. As we all know, puberty couldn't be held off forever, and neither could her powers. Her powers begin getting out of control when her best friend commits suicide, after being rejected by the jock she just lost her virginity to. It appears the football team has a points system going for every girl a guy sleeps with. They are basically hunting down these girls for sport, as sexual predators. This probably goes on at alot of schools.

One of these guys on the football team, Jesse cares about other things in life besides football. It just so happens he's the best looking. He and Rachel are in an English class together. THey start dating, much to the dismay of his former girlfriend and friends. Rachel has also given the police information about what the players are doing.

  You know the guy loves Rachel in earnest, but she has an unfortunate cynical streak.  Under the guise of apologizing to her, the "in crowd" invites her to a party. They play a video of her and Jesse they taped, unbeknownst to her or Jesse when she lost her virginity. They also show her their points book. Unfortunately, she believes them instead of checking with him first and her rage turns into a revenge-frenzied massacre.

  Jesse shows up and she realizes the truth of Jesse's love too late. Revenge by killing only allows the bad guys to win.
