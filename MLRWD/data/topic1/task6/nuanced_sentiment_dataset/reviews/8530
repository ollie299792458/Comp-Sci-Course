As a HUGE fan of the original Donne Darko, I was very excited to see that this movie had been released, even though I really should know better. Great movies don't need sequels. (I ignore the second and third Matrixes also.)

I will say I actually enjyed it when I viewed it on its own merits. The acting was decent though the direction was weak, the cinematography was very pretty indeed, and if you like coming of age stories, you might like this all right.

However, if the first movie happened as stated, then this film could not have occurred. Sam possesses Donnie's copy of Roberta Sparrow's book, with his drawings of Frank's mask in it. Um, No.

Also, the general flavor of the movie is so very different that it cannot but fail to create a franchise. While Donnie Darko was funny and insightful throughout most of it, S. Darko is tenaciously unwilling to amuse.

Overall, I really wish the writer had explored his own ideas, for they were present, and saught to write an independent film, leaving the heavy handed Donnie Darko-isms at the door. The movie is so busy tying all the Donnie Darko flavored time travel stuff into the story that every single original plot point goes unresolved. This is why people should use the work of others as an inspiration, and not a springboard.
