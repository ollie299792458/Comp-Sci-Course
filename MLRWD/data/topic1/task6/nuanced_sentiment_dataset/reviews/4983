Entering this season, you need to know only one thing: this is not going to resolve seasons 1-3, this is now an entirely different show and though it references seasons 1-3, you need only have seen the recaps in order to be up to speed.

I did not like season 4.

I'll admit, it got exciting in the middle, but in terms of this season on its own, there were a number of pacing issues, inconsistencies, and unexplained/plot-hole-like elements that dragged it down. Fringe has always been guilty of introducing a number of exciting things midway only to change their mind on a lot of it and introduce something else towards the end, that suffers from not having a sufficient amount of set up.

Every season of the show is guilty of this, and with the exception of season 2, has never truly paid off.

Now, in terms of season 4 and its place in the series as a whole; I hate it. I feel insulted, as an audience member, cheated, to now know that everything I had followed in the first three seasons; the characters, the plots, everything I had invested in, has been abandoned. There are those that will argue that season 4 could not have existed without seasons 1-3, and I understand this, however, season 4 is its own entity and the universe, the story, the characters of the first three seasons are gone - inaccessible, and the further season 4 goes the more it solidifies this fact, ending the debate once and for all with 'A Short Story About Love'.

Here is my warning: for those who have watched seasons 1-3 for the story and characters and wish to see that resolved before anything else, my advice is to treat the season 3 finale as the end of that series, and consider season 4 its spin off. For those who just want entertainment, by all means proceed.

I unfortunately will not be tuning into its fifth and final season, for one simple reason: the show I began watching and became invested in ended in 2011. This latest incarnation represents nothing else but a "what if?".
