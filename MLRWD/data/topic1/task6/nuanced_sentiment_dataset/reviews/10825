Being a fan of John Carpenter, I'm familiar with most of his work. However, I recently saw this film for sale in the mall, and I had never heard of it before. So I decided to buy it. After doing some research, I realized why this film is somewhat obscure. It was a made-for-TV movie written just before Halloween. And up until a couple of years ago, it wasn't available on DVD. After viewing it for the first time, there's really not much I have to say about it. It's a combination of "When a Stranger Calls" (for those like me, who saw that one before this one) and "Rear Window",the Alfred Hitchcock classic. And its easy to see the influence that Hitchcock has on some of Carpenter's early work. However, this is a made-for-TV film, so there is hardly any violence or language in this one. In some ways, I think this hurts the film, because I do find that the film is a bit un-eventful and bland for the most part. And though the ending is somewhat climatic I suppose, it just doesn't really do much for me. All in all, this is a decent little movie, definitely worth viewing a few times, and probably worth owning as well, especially if you're a Carpenter fan. But it isn't quite as memorable as other work of John Carpenter.
