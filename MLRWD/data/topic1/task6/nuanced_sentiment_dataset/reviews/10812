There is not much I can say that other reviews have not already said.  I, too, am a serious fan of JMS' words and have all of the Babylon 5 DVDs, but after getting this one from the library, I am enormously relieved to not have purchased it for myself.

It is hard to give the actors some slack knowing that they usually grow into their roles and that most pilots are bad, but this was indeed painful.  The disgraced Ranger captain is far too Hollywood, with the chin and the slightly dimpled smile, to sell being a complex, flawed individual with a past, which I'm sure is how JMS wanted to write him.  The weapons expert is too much the one-sided warrior woman who is closed off emotionally (a cliche).  The only character (other than G'kar) who resonated with reality was the Minbari second-in-command.  He saves any scene he's in.

As for the plot, while I like the fact that the fight is never over, I think we as fans of the universe are just not ready (after years of the Shadow war) to see a bigger baddie than the Shadows.  Their offspring such as the Drak, sure, but something that is supposedly capable of kicking the First Ones about the galaxy?  I just can't accept it.

To summarize, JMS is a god but not infallible, and this, unfortunately, was a mistake.  I give it 3 stars mostly out of some stubborn loyalty to the franchise, but also for the Minbari and for G'kar, masterfully done as always.
