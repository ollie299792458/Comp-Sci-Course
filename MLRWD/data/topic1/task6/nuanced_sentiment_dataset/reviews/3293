The second APES movie is not as good as the first. But the last 45 minutes are explosive! The problem is that they waste the first half of the movie catching up on stuff -- a new astronaut lands, finds the luscious Nova, she takes him to meet Zira and Cornelius . . . it's even more tedious than it sounds.

Things only start cooking when Brent and Nova discover the underground passage that leads to the city of the mutants. Not only is there a chilling series of scenes with the mutants using mind control to make Brent fight with Taylor and even try to strangle the sweet and gentle Nova, but intercut are some really effective scenes of the apes marching on the mutant city, and overcoming some interesting visual effects.

On balance, the movie fails to maintain a high level of excitement. Too much time is wasted early on. But the ideas presented in the mutant section are interesting. On the ape side, the balanced portrayal of Dr. Zaius as both a prejudiced old fool and an ape of integrity who cares for his people and believes in his Lawgiver sincerely is quite thought provoking.

James Franciscus is probably the worst thing about this movie. Not that he's a bad actor, just that his character is a lame carbon copy of Heston's Taylor. He has to make the same lame speeches about "we blew it all up" and he never even has a real love scene with Nova. Brent the astronaut is a real nowhere man. Doesn't have a point of view, knows not where he's going to . . . but Dr. Zaius and the mutants still make this one worth watching!
