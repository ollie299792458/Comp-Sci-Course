Frank Herbert's Dune is one of the best stories EVER.

I loved the David Lynch version (included); the extended version (also included) is not directed by David Lynch. Being that it is LONGER and a little bit more intense, it is harder for some folks new to Dune to appreciate.

If you are new to Dune, I'd recommend watching the original (Lynch) version first, after reading the book of course!

The extended edition shows lots of newly restored scenes, and provides additional background and nuance to help you understand the story. Some of the new scenes are very cool -- the best one being where they show how the Fremen get the Water of Life.

However, it is 3 hours long, and it takes away the sexy narration by Princes Irulan, replacing it with male narration. I would have given it 5 stars if they had kept the Irulan narration and if they had done a better job explaining the origin of the extended version.

Even more scenes are available on Disc1 as "deleted scenes". These are also very much worth watching too! There is also a documentary that is pretty decent.

The snap case is awesome. The 5:1 Surround Sound works great.
