I have to say that I seriously respect rob zombie now.  This movie kicked ass.  They kind of pick up where the last movie left off and they are like wearing armor in a shootout with the cops.  That was a nice touch.  But the thing that really sets this movie apart is the level of detail that went into every scene and every shot for that matter.  There is a scene where a girl gets hit by a semi.  So we go to the next shot and see like 10 feet of blood and intestines.  They could have gone overboard on this, but it does actually give you a realism of what this might look like.  But don't worry, they don't dwell on it.  And there is a scene where they are in a room, hostages and bad guys together.  I will only say that this scene is not for the faint of heart.  Youwill cringe if you don't like these intense, killer, psycho type scenes.  But I was really on the edfge of my seat.  And mother fujer that is what a movie is supposed to do!  And I also have to say that being a kung fu fan I thought the fight scenes were really good.  They don't go like mantis against tiger claw but it does give you a sense of what a real fight would be like and what it would come down to.  Survival.

The sound is pretty  good.  The music is good too.  i didn't exactly like the movie too much to watch a documentary that is like twice ass long as the movie but did listen to the director's commentary and thought that was very enjoyable.  Rob does a good job of pointing out a stunt that I think he says the real actor did that would rival pretty much anything in hong kong I have ever seen.  So don't get me wrong casue i'm a fu fan, there isn't really too much fighting in this, but a very intense movie.
