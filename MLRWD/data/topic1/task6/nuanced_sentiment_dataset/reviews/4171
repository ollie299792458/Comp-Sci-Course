straub's book is a classic and any attempt to scrunch it down to a 90 minute to 120 minute film would be problematic, as is the case with this movie.  the only way to bring the book to true visial form would be to make a mini-series out of it.
in any case, the cast was outstanding, the acting was fine, alice krige was great as both alma and eva (i'm not in the same warp as that reviewer who must be suffering from some kind of krige-mania), and the overall feel was pretty eerie.  so long as you approach the film with the right mind set (knowing that going in you are about to watch an under-two-hour movie which needed to be a 6-hour movie, and that the film would leave out some of the cooler moments in the book, such as the barnes' party where young peter meets the evil anna mostyn), you should enjoy what the film does have to offer.  the ending was weak (obviously nothing like the book's ending) but overall it's a good scary watch if you're in the mood for less blood and more tension.
