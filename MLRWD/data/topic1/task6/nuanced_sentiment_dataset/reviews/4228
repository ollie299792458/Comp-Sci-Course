There is a curse throughout horror movie franchises (or franchises in general) condemning the fifth episode to mediocrity at best, or unfocused, mundane nonsense at worst. The fifth episodes of the following franchises: Friday the 13th pt. 5 (the "Jason imposter" episode), Halloween 5 (that corny man in black gimmick), Star Trek 5 (the lame Shatner directed ep), Leprechaun (okay, that series sucked to begin with), Hellraiser 5 (Craig Scheffer as a debauched cop, while Pinhead is over on the sideline), Return of the Living Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street... the list goes on and on.

Saw V is no exception to this rule. After a cool opening involving an fbi agent ingeniously beating a jigsaw trap, we get scene after scene of Scott Patterson walking around with an angry look on his face, Costas Mandalor in an exceptionally stoic offering as Jigsaw's apparent heir, flashbacks that make no sense (the chronology of the Jigsaw/ Hoffman link is especially convoluted), drab photography that lacks the flair of the Wan/ Bousman directed offerings, and an ending that is telegraphed from pretty much the opening scene.

Even the relevance of the "game" is not explained until Kevin Greutert's superb Saw VI. As it stands, the subplot comes completely out of left field. People looking for ingenious traps better stick to the other sequels as Saw V hasn't a single interesting gadget throughout its running time. And if you're a Saw fan the plot developments are not so germane that subsequent films would be confusing if you haven't seen this one.

Saw V is about the only entry in the franchise I don't like, and further proof that the number "5" should be omitted from the franchise index.
