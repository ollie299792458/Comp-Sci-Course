A few weeks ago I saw this movie and I wasn't expecting much.  As a matter of fact I was expecting a dud because in my opinion I think Nicholas Cage's career has been on the downturn with some of his latest movies.  I was suprised with Matchstick Men, it was very enjoyable from beginning to the extremely suprising end.  It is a humorous movie that is also a smart and slick con movie as well.
Nicholas Cage and his partner Sam Rockwell make a living off of being con artists.  They are quite successful at their line of work.  The two of them make a great team and they have great chemistry.  Cage's character also has obsessive compulsive disorder and he is always cleaning stuff.  He can't really function without his meds. and that plays a role in this movie as well.  Part way through the movie Cage's character finds out he has a teenage daughter he had about 15 years ago.  To cut things short.  They reunite, shes happy, they argue, she thinks he's a bad father, he tells her he makes a living is a con artist, shes intrigued and wants to become a con artist as well.  I will leave the rest to you to find out what else happens in this suprising and twisting movie.
I like some of Ridley Scotts movies but this one really stands out in my opinion.  I enjoyed movies he made like Alien &amp; Gladiator but Matchstick Men is another great movie that when you think Ridley Scott hopefully this movie will come to thought as well.  There are alot of con movies come out every year but Matchstick Men stands out in that crowd.  If you enjoyed other recent movies like Confidence or Oceans Eleven you are going to love this movie.
With all honesty I mean it when I say Matchstick Men is one of last years best movies. It combines humor, a bit of action, and plot twists along the way.  Give this movie a try if you like Nicolas Cage in what I think is one of his best roles and movies he's played since Leaving Las Vegas.
