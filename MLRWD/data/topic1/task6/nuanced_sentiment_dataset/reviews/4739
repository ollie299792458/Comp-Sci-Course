I never write reviews but I feel compelled to review this one. I'm pregnant for the second time, in my 8th month, and have been doing this DVD for a few months now. I regularly practice yoga and did prenatal yoga throughout my first pregnancy as well, both at studios and on DVD. I needed an alternate to the Shiva Ray DVD, which was good but not advanced enough for me. So I bought this and the Vol. 1. Both are challenging to follow, with the screen switching between what advanced exercisers should do vs. beginners. Also, neither lets you know in advance what props you need, so I often find myself scrambling to find what I need.

For the yoga DVD, the instructor often gives the wrong direction, screwing up right with left. And while the video is fast-paced, I worry that it's too fast for those of us who need to be a little extra careful about overstretching, balancing, etc.

Perhaps my biggest concern is all the moves done on one's back toward the end of the video. Every OB/GYN, book and exercise instructions I've heard or read caution pregnant women to avoid being flat on their backs for any length of time after the first trimester. I think it's careless and perhaps dangerous to have pregnant women doing pelvic tilts/bridge and baby cradle.

Pregnancy is short and fitness is important. Don't waste your time or money on this DVD. There are better ones.
