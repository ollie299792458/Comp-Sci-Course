This movie is on right now and i couldnt stop laughing. I use to watch stephen king's SLEEPWALKERS back in the day when i was young, the preview made it look like a romance but then it quickly turned into another horror, or so they claimed it to be. I don't remember it being this funny? I mean come on those lines are hysterical, MY MOTHER IS GONNA KILL ME, WHEN DID I START LOSING YOUR TRUST, COP-CABOB!!! NO VEGETABLES NO DESSERT, TANYA I DONT THINK YOU'RE GETTING INTO THE SPIRIT OF THIS? This has got to be in the comedy section at the video store even though there are some graphic violent scenes but this flick is so cheesy it's comical. The acting is herendous, and in many of stephen king movies nothing makes sense like when he killed the cop and tanya sat there on the radio calling for help and watching the cat claw charles eyes out? Hello? Getaway car? She was in the police vehicle, how about driving away, since he already killed the cop? But whatever, what do you expect from old cheesy stephen king movies. Some of his books and movies are good, but we can never forget these kind, the cheesy funny ones that could never pass as  a HORROR.
