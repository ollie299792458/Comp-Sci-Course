The first thing I watched was Preservation Officer Robert Gitt. This was about a 10-minute introduction to the Basil Rathbone/Sherlock Holmes collection on Blu-ray disc. He stated that the efforts to compiling this collection began about 12 years ago and took 10 years to do. He stated that they took about 1 year per film in preservation efforts.
Having said that, I give a one star because I paid $100 for this collection, and it took 10 years to complete this collection, but it cannot be viewed on widescreen television. There are big black bars on both sides of the movie and it is very distracting. Almost every television being sold in these modern times is going to be widescreen. I think they could have done better. Ten years and no widescreen? Wow. I should have read the other reviews. No wonder the regular, single-movie DVD Sherlock Holmes movies sell for a higher price......because they are better!!

To you who are reading this.......would you like to buy my Blu-ray collection from me?
