Ok, if it was just me, i might have given it 5 stars.  I loved the movie.  I admit, the first 1/2 hour were painful to watch.  My husband said this was the kind of movie he would have walked out on, but stuck with so we could watch it together. He still didnt like it.

But i loved this movie.  I loved the imagery, the way he gives a feel for the harsh life in new york, of people living on the edge crammed right up against those who arent . . . i love the way i could almost feel the cold, the way it drove me nuts that everyone closed the garage door by putting their hand thru the missing window pane -- in the winter.  Why didnt they patch the darn window?  The scene of her sitting under the tree by the lake, reading the letters.  Without any comment, you know how cold and hard that ground was, but she stayed until it got dark, discovering for the first time the love that was the foundation of the unhappy life she grew up in.  That scene was so intense for me in its silence, and my husband didntget anything from it at all.  My husband said he disliked the cinematography, and i'm not generally one that likes a movie for its cinematography, but i loved this one.

Its not for everyone, but for those who appreciate the depth of silence and dont flinch at real pain, its beautiful.
