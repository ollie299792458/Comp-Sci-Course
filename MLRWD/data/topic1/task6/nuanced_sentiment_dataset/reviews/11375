If you're expecting originality you'll be disappointed. If you're expecting a faithful adaptation of the superb book this is based on you'll be let down. If you just want to sit down to enjoy a entertaining movie, that is well-acted (the supporting cast (Bridgette Wilson in particular) do as good a job as Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Philippe & Freddie Prince Jr.) you've come to the right page.

Four friends run over a man & dump his dead (?) body into the ocean after their drunken 4th July celebrations. One year later almost to the day, one of the friends receives a letter & the game is on. As it draws to 4th July the letters escalate to hair cutting, disappearing bodies & hit and runs.

I must mention that the main `stalk n slash' scene is gripping, edge-of-your-seat stuff. I wouldn't really call I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER a slasher though; it's more of a suspense thriller. The film focuses revenge.

The film relies on tension & building suspense instead of blood and gore, like classics such as HALLOWEEN. I'm not saying that I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is on that level, but it is well done. The film is better then it's chief comparison SCREAM because it seems more realistic.

One observation; I'm quite sure that the film had an 18 certificate in cinemas, while the DVD is certified as a 15. This makes me wonder over missing footage. I don't want to give anything away, but the killer has collected newspaper articles that detail something that seemingly has very little to do with the given plot. Just little things like that are winding me up. It doesn't spoil the plot or anything like that, so it isn't really important I guess.

Also, Anne Hecht has a seemingly pointless supporting role. So where has any left out footage gone? It's not included as an extra. Are they going to bring out 50 DVD editions of this or something?
