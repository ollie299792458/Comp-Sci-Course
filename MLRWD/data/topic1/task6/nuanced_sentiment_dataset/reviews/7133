So, we have another hack 'n slash thriller series on our hands. After watching the Halloween series fall into decadence, I'm loath to even think of watching Scream 3 when it comes out. However, while not on the same par  as the first two Halloween sequals, Scream 2 isn't that bad. While not all  of the long list of stars are talented actors, I must admit that most  aren't particularly bad. This movie's script does not do many of the actors  justice, though. They attempt to suprise you by killing the untouchable  actor/actress(Yes, you KNOW who I am talking about), but all they do is  take away my interest for watching Scream 3. If you want to see vintage  Neve, watch Wild Things. For the best Sarah Michelle Gellar, watch the  Buffy the Vampire Slayer series. Cox fits a lot better in a Friends format,  than a horror film. Also, don't hang on your seats for a blow-out ending.  It's an average one, if that. Still, just for an interesting view into the  mind of a serial killer(s), watch this movie when you have the time.
