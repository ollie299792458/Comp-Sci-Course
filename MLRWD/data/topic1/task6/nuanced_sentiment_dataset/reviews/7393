After the first few minutes of "the Legend of Zorro" it became apparent that the film should have been titled "the Legend of Sorrow". The acting is terrible, the plot is retarded and the action sequences are as believable as the Bush administration. While watching the first scene where Zorro snatches back a chest from the evil priest I was awe-struck with the unrealistic physics relating to a movie. I couldn't understand what sort of Director would think that an audience would be ignorant enough to believe that a horse and carraige could so easily take out a brick pilar but in turn be so easily destroyed by a piece of rope. I found it to be most insulting to my intelligence that I am supposed to believe the character of Zorro (Sorrow) could be able to keep up with a carraige drawn by two horses while running atop a wall as wide as two bricks. I found the evil priest character to be insulting to religious people, and have not ruled out the fact that the cast must have been devil worshippers who probably started each day with a Satanic ritual before starting filming. That would certainly explain Sorrow's supernatural ability to be able to pull off the incredible (and most unbeliavable) acrobatics in this film, the dark lord must have granted him the power. Needless to say that I do not recommend this film to anyone unless they want to experience the feeling of having your brain cells melted away by a piece of cinematography that is guerunteed to lower your IQ. Disgusting, they have ruined the prospects of a Zorro franchise with this load of garbage, and the Director was obviously unaware of the fact that the character of Zorro is supposed to be more like an old-days James Bond that can get out of sticky situation using realistic solutions rather than the far-fetched overblown disaster that we have here before us.
