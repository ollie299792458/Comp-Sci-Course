I watched this movie late in the evening, after coming home from my son's 14th birthday party. My festive mood quickly turned responsive and contemplative. My son watched part of it too but fell asleep due to exhaustion. Thin Red Line is a fascinating view on a dark and cruel chapter of WWII, the bitter, relentless fight over Guadalcanal in the Pacific theater of war. What struck me most about this film is the fact that man's conflict is set against the overwhelming background of nature and the elements. Although the fighting is intense and without mercy, nature is in large part undisturbed by it and uninterested in the outcome. The fighting scenes are intersparsed by scenes of tranquility and peacefulness. American GI's and Japanses Imperial troops are both depicted as accidental heroes and victims. There are exiting vistas and images of nature, animals, sunsets and sundowns, clouds and the omnipresent jungle. You hear the rustling of the wind in the grass and the trees. Like it must have been for the soldiers most of the time. Although there are parallels with Saving Private Ryan, it is an altogether different approach. The acting is great. Especially Jim Caviezel's and Sean Penn's. The actors doing a cameo (John Travolta, Nick Nolte)in my view are far less convincing.

I recommend this movie to anyone who is bored by the average run of the mill war flick with brainless heroes who rampage through the movie shooting everything that moves without being hit or hampered by remorse. Mr Terence Malick did an excellent job. I look forward to his next movie, whatever that may be. An intelligent, philosophical and artful anti war-movie depicting the cruelty of man and the senselessness of human conflict in all its degrading details. I was truly impressed by it.
