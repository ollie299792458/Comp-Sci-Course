The video presentation is pretty great, I have to say. There is an unacceptable flaw that makes the only reasonable recommendation to skip purchasing this bluray: Dolby Digital 1.0 audio.

There have been several releases of classic movies from Warner Brothers, most notably westerns, that contain a dump of the audio track from previous edition DVDs. The most infuriating aspect of this laziness is that a lossless track *must* exist as the basis for the Dolby Digital lossy track! If that track already exists, why not just put it on the disc as LPCM 1.0? Laziness is the only reason I can possibly think of, as it surely isn't endearing any discerning consumers toward Warner Brothers' catalog releases.

Warner Brothers came out of the gate very strong, especially with titles from New Line cinema, but now seem to have gone quite sour. Between the extremely poor audio quality on this disc, and the low video bitrates/quality on the Fight Club special edition due to the lack of two discs, I'm avoiding Warner Brothers catalog releases unless I read many reviews that state otherwise.

I suggest everyone else avoid the same irritation by making sure there is a lossless track on any blurays you buy, or at least avoiding the dreaded Dolby Digital. If you're looking for classic films that are given a proper treatment, I recommend Criterion and Studio Canal.

I sincerely hope that WB offers a trade-in program like Sony had done for The Fifth Element. It is a crying shame that this classic film has an inferior release compared to other great films of the same era from other studios.
