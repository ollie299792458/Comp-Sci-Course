Social Security has a 2.7 Trillion dollar surplus.....even this film explained that the government is taking from the "Social Security Fund" for their own projects.
Sorry, but Social Security is not the problem and isnt an entitlement progam.

Medicare, Military and Taxes.....these are the main issues.

Miliarty spending is a joke and we now spend more than the next 15 countries combined......and 13 of them are our allies.  Cut Military spending and issue a tax next time there is a war.....if the war is worth it, a tax wont matter.

Medicare needs to be fixed but first we need to just elimate the Medica Prescription plan passed in 2003....like the film explained...it was passed to gain votes.

Taxes.  Anyone who is serious about not leaving this debt for our children will have no problem accepting a tax increase.  Go back to the Clinton era tax levels at a minimum.

This film was good, but it should have done a better job by showing our Military spending and should have left Social Security out of the conversation.
