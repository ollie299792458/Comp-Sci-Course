When I started watching this DVD I thought it was a parady because the acting and the writing was so bad. As it continued it became apparant that the movie was meant to be serious. The entire production is like a high school production written by someone who cannot write but who thinks that the disjointed, off-the-wall, dialoque makes it artistic.

The monolog that is interspersed between the hilariously bad acting is unbelievable. At one point, the woman who owns the cafe and who was having an affair with the main character's brother (Obviously not a very successful affair, as she is complaining about their sex life as he is on the bed masterbating in front of her). The woman has to be in her 60s and looks like she has been through the wringer. The monolog at this point in the movie is, "Her mind was clouded by the extreme, precise indescribable melting of these two muscular, sinewy bodies. She tried to force the soft, dissolving mass of her own sumptuous body between them". Meaning, the two brothers.

The main character has a fantastic body and that basically ends his contribution to the film. Most of the characters are not appealing physically and are older. Many look like dissapated patrons of a leather bar.

In referring to someone else in the movie the monolog goes, "But, thanks to Querelle, he would be adorned with a true murderer".

"For the first time he was going to meet another criminal, a murderer of his own stature with whom he would be able to talk business. Now in this abandoned prison Querelle was to meet a young fellow who had killed. The thought filled him with tenderness. The murderer was an awkward kid--a murderer for nothing. A fool!".
