I didn't know what to expect, but was thankfully impressed by this film. Some might be dispointed with the movie, in this day and age of movie after movie that goes deeper and deeper into ultraviolence in place of real tension and raw emotion of say hitchcock movies. The scary part of the movie is how realistic and identifiable the plot is. If your looking for lots of blood guts you'll be disapointed. But I liked the movie a lot because it had lots of essential elements for a good movie: gets better with repeated viewings, well shot, expertly acted, good locations, several funny moments weighed in with dramatic parts showing the movie and creators didn't take themselves seriously, and the ending kept my friend and I discussing the movie well after it had finished. The ending goes by very quickly. I haven't seen the original, but I understand the movie is different enough to have added an additional character (perhaps they made it a remake so as not to be accused of ripping off the original.) I look forward to getting the DVD for the extras and whatever else is on there. Emily Browning and Elizabeth Banks are so punk rock. Definatley worth a look, and in contrast a great little film overlooked in favor of countless garbage movies the industry is endlessly churning out. Gimmie a break...
