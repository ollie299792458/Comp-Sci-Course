If there was a movie this year that epitomized homoeroticism, this film would win hands down.  While trying to bill itself as a modern day Karate Kid with a little bit of Fight Club and the O.C., it fails but not for lack of trying.  The movie is filled with so many cliches (bitter but good-hearted martial arts master, mean bully who is from an abusive family environment, a blond who who tries to pass herself off as smart, etc) that if it weren't for the eye candy in Sean Faris and Cam Gigandet, it would fail miserably.  What gets me is that it was really two stories that could have been intriguing combined into a slugfest.  Tyler's story could have been told more as a drama about a kid losing his parent and not forgiving himself.  McCarthy's story would have also been interesting as a kid who takes out his anger on everyone around him, except perhaps the person who deserves it: his father.  But I have to give credit where it's due.  The fight scenes are nothing short of incredible, especially the final bout between Jake and Ryan.  Kudos to the stunt coordinator for a sequence extremely well done that even the bouts in Fight Club pale in comparison to this movie.  Overall, I think Faris needs to polish up his acting abilities so he'll get more serious roles.  He isn't bad but he needs to work on how to show his emotions better.  Yes, he's extremely good-looking but good looks for a male actor can only go so far in this industry.  Gigandet, on the other hand, is an extremely talented performer who deserves to be a bigger star than he currently is.  He reminds me a bit of Channing Tatum but not as rough around the edges.
