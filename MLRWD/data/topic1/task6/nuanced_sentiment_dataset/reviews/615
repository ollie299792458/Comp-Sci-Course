As has been stated by other reviewers, this is a no frills package.  Since Season 1 isn't my favorite (the show hadn't found its stride, nor had the Phoenix Foundation come into existence), I wasn't expecting more than being able to fill in some back story.

For that, this set is terrific.  The episodes are full length, not the shortened for extra commercials episodes that you get on TV.  Anderson is good and conveys a real sense of delight and wonder without seeming either naive or stupid.

I like the character, and I like the way he thinks his way out of problems.  It's nice to see a good guy with a complex and personal morality.  Too often, we end up believing that a character is the good guy because we're told he is.  With MacGyver, seeing him in action is believing.

My problem is that these are three steps below bare basic.  There are no close captions or scene selection options which I thought were standard these days.  Worse, the first disc throws the viewer into commercials for Happy Days and its spinoffs.  The only thing those shows had in common with MacGyver is Henry Winkler.  They are impossible to get past, too.

I haven't run into the color correction or compression issues that some other people have noted.  But I will say that the Avid is only a decade or so old.  These were not edited by computer and some of the older techniques and effects can look a little cheesy compared to the bare basics that can be done on a good computer today.

I'll be first in line for the season 2 episodes because I like MacGyver and the reruns are so chopped and washed out.  Here's hoping that Paramount will give us better quality and maybe an extra or two.
