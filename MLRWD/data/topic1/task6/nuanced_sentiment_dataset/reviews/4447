I never watch a movie more than twice, but this movie I watch almost every evening with my little girl before her bed time.  There is so much artist diversity I cant get over it.  From the old fashioned hand drawn characters to the artist painted mountains and other backdrop to the computer generated grass, trees and its hard to tell at times what else.  I think the lack of english dialogue is wonderful.  My daughter is just over one and she reacts to the body language as though she understands what is going on.  When baby Spirit is born my daughter smiles and laughs each and every time she sees this part, she loves it when he makes his little noises and his mom welcomes him into the world.  The music is fantastic, Brian Adams and Hanz are amazing together, not that my growing up with Bryan Adams blaring in the background most of my young life has anything to do with it :)  This movie has not been given the publicity and credit it justly deserves.  I encourage anyone who gets this DVD to watch all the special features as well because you wont believe the work put into this movie. I recommend this movie for any age.
