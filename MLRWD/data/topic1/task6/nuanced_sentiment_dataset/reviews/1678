The above quote is from the only Stephen King book I have ever read ( On Writing is a non-fictional account of how King developed his writing craft). I liked it so much that I bought Storm of the Century.
Boy what a dissapointment!! Storm seemed like a poor crossing of Cape Fear, Perfect Storm and Sophie's Choice. But what really let me down was the crass disregard for credible story telling. Two examples: 1) The bad guy freezes a door in order for the blood-stained, gunshot-carrying hero (can a hero be this dumb?) to be "forced" to escort an ultra dangerous psycopath killer through a supermarket aisle crammed with mesmerized island people ( who can't keep a safe distance); conveniently nobody thinks of even shielding a child in the room from facing the murderer nose-to-nose--- at that point, I said to myself, this scene is so unnatural, so forced ( not truth) that this child has to be the eventual victim. 2) Later a young woman horribly and openly kills her lover. Do the town-people take any precautions against further maniac actions by her? Island people could not think of such logic; instead they actually put her in charge of safe-guarding the same child!
Mr. King can ask 200 islander (and their children, acquaintances, visitors,etc.) to forever keep this farce a secret, but I am one viewer that cannot.
Okay, Mr. King, I will excuse you on this one, inasmuch as this was made for TV. I will see Shining and report back, hopefully cheerfully.
