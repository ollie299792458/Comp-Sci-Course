If all you are after are some great SFX, some tough-guy action scenes, and a gorgeous Pontiac GTO, then by all means, buy it - this is the movie for you.

If not, well, stay away.

The reason it gets 3 stars from me is that there were plenty of opportunities to make this movie a real winner.  But like the Scorpion King for The Rock, the producers relied a bit too much on the up-and-coming-replacement-for-Arnold status of Vin Diesel to make this a hit.

Several story development lines fell flat - Vin was like every other typical hero, even though he was presented as a "bad guy".  Give him a tux, and he could have been James Bond.

IMHO, they should have taken his baddie act further, and tried to distance himself more from James Bond - if not in effect, then at least in character development and through his actions.

If there is ever a third installment of this - it will be because Hollywood throws us more of a bone in the sequel: a believeable main character whose motivations and actions make sense.
