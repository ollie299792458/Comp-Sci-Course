Wow - I had heard this film got mixed reviews, but this was worse than my downgraded expectations.  Meryl Streep's performance is, of course, up to her usual standards.  Wonderful work, and I'm glad she was recognized, wondering if her award also hints at her body of work that's been "un" awarded.

That said, I give a big thumbs down to the approach the writers/director took to telling Thatcher's story.  A previous post suggested that perhaps those who made the film strongly disagreed with Thatcher's politics.  I think they're onto something.  There was no emotional connection, little attempt to humanize or show a believable personal struggle beyond a silhouette of Streep resting head on clenched hands at a desk.  There's simply no evidence that the filmmakers liked any part of this woman or her story.  The nearly two hours was little more than snapshots of historical moments that are already known...no insight or revelation about her, her cabinet, her family.  It felt like watching a lazy book report that basically retold too much of what we already know.  And yes, love or hate her, I think it disrespectful and odd to anchor the story in the present day -- while she's still alive -- with the assumption that she's wandering around her home passing her days in dementia-induced flashbacks being whispered and worried about by caretakers.
