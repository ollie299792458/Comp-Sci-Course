I notice that in all of these Indo-Eurpoean biased documentaries they will rarely speak of the great civilizations of Africa. They throw Egypt in after the actual original inhabitants (blacks)were "wiped out" by invaders and the culture ruled by Indo-European ideas of patriarchy, racism and brutality. The cities of early civilizations didn't even have walls because there was no fear of attack. They were dependent on each other and everyone had a duty to contribute to the society as a whole. The "true barbarians" who lived "hand to mouth" in the deserts have written history in their favor, yet they cannot prove anything  they acomplished (other than slavery, killing and bloodshed) with the today's actual archelogical truth about their origins. Africa's great civilizations predate any of the Islamic or Indo-European so called civilizations where people of color and women served as chattel under their oppressive regimes. The "Middle Eastern" beginnings of man and civilization has already been proved a lie and implausible. As usual,follow the DNA and people migrations you will find the truth! So called documentaries like this one and others like it should be labeled what the are, racist propaganda!
