This remains one of my favorite films for a variety of reasons.  The cinematography, beautiful soundtrack, great acting are among these.
Fly Away Home is based on a true story, and let's face it, audiences love true stories.  From Finding Fish to Catch Me if You Can to The Pianist, real sells.  And why not?  It's familiar, it's heartfelt and it's touching, as is the case of Fly Away Home.
The story is that of orphaned Amy's attempt to live with her father, and raise a flock of geese.  She eventually teaches them to migrate.  Anna Pacquin is stunning as Amy and Jeff Daniels displays surprising skills as her estranged yet caring father.  The relationship between the two of them and Amy and the geese is hauntingly beautiful and so vivrant on screen. Mark Isham provides a sweeping soundtrack that will resonate in your mind for days.  It's a shame Columbia never released the CD, but the DVD contains an option for the full score. 
As well as the score, the Special Edition DVD contains enough features to hold your attention for hours.  Documentaries, commentaries, featurettes, trailers and production notes bring together a fitting package for a captivating film.
