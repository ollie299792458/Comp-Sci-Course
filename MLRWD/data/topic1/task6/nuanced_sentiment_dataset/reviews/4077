Welcome to The Dollhouse has to be my favorite movie of all time. Basically becasue it has that charm that makes anyone feel good about themselves. After what "Dawn" the main charecter (Matrazzo) has  to go through, (with the whole school hating her, and her family life in  shambles) you gotta feel better about your self when in comparison to her.  You can see through the movie, that Matrazzo is really beautiful lady. This  just means that Matrazzo gives a blockbuster preformance, because her  charecter, Dawn, is a really ugly girl. The direction is decent, but what  really puts the movie over the top is Matrazzo, and Brendon Sexton the  Third. He plays another sad teen going through hard times, your average D  minus poverty stricken pot head, who is really believable as his charecter.  And the chemistry of the two together is magnicficent! The ending of the  movie is a real mystery and i'm not gonna give it away, although you'll  probably be disappointed, but i will say it makes you think about Dawn's  life. It's a little shock for the oblivious overprotective parent, but just  right for a teen who is in Dawn's position, or has been there before.
