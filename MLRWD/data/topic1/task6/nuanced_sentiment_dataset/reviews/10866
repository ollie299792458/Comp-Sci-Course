There is one thing that even the most jaded viewer must admit about Dancer in the Dark; Bjork's performance was outstanding. She puts her heart and soul into every moment of this film. She is a singer not a trained actor and she certainly doesn't have a movie stars looks but in a movie like this that is all for the best. What she lacks in technical craftmanship she more than makes up for in spirit.

When the man who loves her discovers that she is nearly blind she sings "I Really Don't Care"; a powerful paen in which she tells us that she has seen everything she wants and has no regrets even though all around her the world is turning black-- she is content to simply dance in the dark, she has found joy. I watched the film today on video for the first time and I must have replayed that scene a dozen times it is a moment of sheer Platonic Beauty. Unfortunately, right after that the movie, for me at least, falls apart.

The next sequence of scenes, while amazingly well acted and directed-- particularly the death scene-- are so illogical and absurd on so many levels that I lost my "suspension of disbelief", without which the magical meditation of cinema cannot produce transcendence. So close and yet.

The film also would benifit from a judicious cut or two it seems at least 20 minutes too long.

This could have been a great film a true masterpiece. Even so it is well worth watching particularly for old souls with an open mind and a taste for symbolic films that are off the beaten path.
