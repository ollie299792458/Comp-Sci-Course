I saw this late last night and have to say, I watched it knowing I wouldn't be able to sleep afterwards and wanting to stop watching. Hard to do though, such is the grip the director exerts.

Of course, the story itself is so deeply compelling that even if it had been badly made it would have been dificult to switch off.  The sense of "this could just as easily have happened to me" is overwhelming.

We all have memories of that day, and one of mine is of a little snippet of the confusion: at one point the media was announcing that a bomb/plane had hit the State Department, a story that disappeared without trace within hours. That confusion, when it is not clear what is true and what is not, is well-captured here - particularly among the air-traffic controllers.

After the second plane hit no one knew whether there was just one more to come or fifty. Of the thousands of planes flying over the US, any number could have been potential missiles. And clearly, no one had ever envisaged the possibility of something like this happening, so for a moment all the experts and professionals were lost in a "what do we do now" helplessness.

The sheer courage of the passengers in rebelling should never be underestimated.  It would have been remarkable even if there had been previous, similar hijackings, and from the beginning it had been obvious what was going on. In the heat of that terrible moment, in which almost everyone else was dumbfounded or paralysed, it was truly extraordinary.
