I recently saw this movie for the first time.  Compared to other disaster  movies, Airport 1975 is rather one note.  There aren't any twists and turns  that keep the plot suspenceful.  Once the disaster occurs, the rest of the  movie is literally on auto-pilot until the end.  The film also suffers from  a drab, low buget look that is similar to a 1970s made for TV movie.  That  said, this movie is still worth watching as a time capsule of the period.  The clothes and hair styles are always fun to look at, and the cast is  often filled with many familiar faces.  It is also interesting to see that  the flight crew can openly lust after the stewardesses.  In this age of  sexual harrassment awareness,  this can be somthing of a shock.  Many of  the gags in the movie "Airplane!" are direct take offs from  Airport 1975.  The singing nun, the sick kid and the replacement  pilot/stewardess relaionship are all here.  The DVD edition of this movie  is in wide-screen.  For the most part this is a good transfer of an older  film. There is some production notes, but not much else in the extras  department.  If you are a fan of 70s disaster movies, this is required  viewing, but, it is not the best example of the genre.
