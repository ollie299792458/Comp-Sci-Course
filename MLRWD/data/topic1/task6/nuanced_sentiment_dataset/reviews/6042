I'm surprised there aren't more 5(or 4) star reviews of this. For those who DO get Italian horror(as well as thrillers, crime,etc.) this has all the qualities of a classic. And to me a movie that I can watch several times must be a five star movie for that reason alone. And I just watched this for about the eigth time. To me it sort of bridges the gap between the good cannibal flicks and the really bad ones. It's got the hilarious dialogue delivered in hilarious dubbing, cool soundtrack, characters that do dumb inexplicable stuff,excellent overacting courtesy of John Morghen, and even one of the good guys slaps a chick (not once but twice!) to calm her down. And of course the gratuitous violence. Anyone who knows these types of movies knows you sometimes have to slog through some boring parts to get to these moments but that's time to enjoy all the other great qualities. I still sometimes turn away during the animal stuff though. I accept that it's in the movie but have never found it enjoyable in any way. But hey leave it to the Italians. So, those of who "get it" will have probably seen all the other "classics" as well of some of the more obscure titles..... as well as several of the REALLY bad flicks that make Cannibal Ferox look like Citizen Kane! Anyhow I'm just surprised there aren't more positive reviews of this classic. P.S..... I added this after reading several more reviews... I guess some of you DO get Italian horror but just don't care for this. I  was just surprised...I mean they all can't be Cannibal Holocaust. I just thought this was an excellent example/mixture of the good/bad thing..... and why do they always go for the guts first... is there more nutritional value....zombies seem to know this too..... although they liked eyeballs and genitals too so what do I know.
