I saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out back in 1993. I loved it then, when I was 12, and I still love it today when I'm 21. This is a story about a boy named Scott Smalls who just moved to town and has no friends. He is also interested in baseball but has never played. His stepfather keeps promising him he'll teach him how to play catch but never seems to have time until one day when Scott's mom convinces him to take a few minutes from his busy day to teach him. It is not easy at all because Scott seems to not have much, if any, athletic talent. 
The next day after he is taught how to throw and catch he's tested when the town superstar athlete, Benny "The Jet" Rodriguez, who also just happens to be his next door neighbor, invites him to play baseball with him and his friends. They are eight kids who are just awesome at baseball. They just play for fun all day long, every day. This story is mainly about an incident that these guys get into that is started when Scott steals a baseball from his step-father's trophy room. This is no ordinary baseball, it's a ball signed by Babe Ruth! The Babe Ruth. And they actually play a game with it!  That is until Scott happens to hit his first ever ball over the fence and into the yard of the biggest, meanest dog in the town!  I won't give anything else away, you'll just have to watch and see if they get it back or not and if so just how they do it. I highly recommend this for people of all ages but especially for those 12 and under who love the game of baseball.
