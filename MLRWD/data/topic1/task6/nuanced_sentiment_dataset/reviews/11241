I've been searching for the horror movie that would keep me up at night for a couple years, watching on average five horror movies a weekend for the last 2 years. One was able to keep me up for a grand total of 3 hours. Then, one Friday, I watched "The Last Horror Movie." After watching this movie, I was unable to sleep until 4AM on Monday morning.

There were several things that made this movie different than the others. It avoided the four things that tend to lessen a serial killer horror movies effectiveness.

1. The killer is some unknown monster that you never understand.
 - Max is very humanized. You follow him to his sisters home, watch him play with his nephew, watch him at work, and watch him kill.
2. The movie is a gore fest
 - There is very little gore in this movie. I can think of two scenes off the top of my head that involve any blood at all
3. The movie focuses on the victims
 - The victims in this movie don't matter. That's all I'll say on that
4. This couldn't happen to me
 - Because of how humanized Max is, and his method for choosing victims, I can easily see this happening to me.

Although I loved this movie, it is not for everyone. From other reviews I've read on this site and other sites, you either love it or hate it.
