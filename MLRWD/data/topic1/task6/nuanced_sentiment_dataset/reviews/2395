Beautifully filmed, principally in Virginia, not far from Jamestown where the actual events took place.  The production budget for this film is reported to have been $30 million, while the worldwide grosses are only slightly more than that, which means that the movie tanked.  Nonetheless, it stays close to the historical facts relating to John Smith; and Pocahontas, John Rolfe and their son Thomas Rolfe, whose descendants are said to include President Woodrow Wilson's wife.

Native Americans participated in its filming; and as the special features indicate, the production crew did everything possible to make the film authentic.  Indeed, whoever fancies becoming a moviemaker needs to watch the DVD's special features, to realize how much work went into a film that did not break even.  The cast was superb, especially newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher, who was 14 when she was chosen to play the lead, and was graceful, lovely and did a fine job.  The film is slow at times, but the times were slow then too.

The film should have been titled "Pocahontas," because it is the amazing story of one woman's life.  Instead, its actual title--which is innocuous at best, and probably did nothing to sell the movie--was probably chosen because Disney's cartoon epics by the same title were released in 1995 and 1998 (with the second one being subtitled "Journey to a New World").  Yet, that change alone might have increased its grosses, at least among women.  It is only a slice of the story about the "New World," but it is a wonderful and quite complete portrait of Pocahontas' life, and Kilcher truly did it justice.
