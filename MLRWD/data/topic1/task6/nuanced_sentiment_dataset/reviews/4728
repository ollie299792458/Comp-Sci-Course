I was really looking forward to this movie. I am from Australia, and saw this movie advertised when i was visiting the US back in December last year. I didn't get a chance to it at the cinemas while i was there, so i planned on seeing it in the cinemas when i was back in Australia, but the movie doesn't come to the cinemas here until the end of June!! Australia sucks for films, games,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015ET3YY">The Orphanage [Blu-ray</a>] well everything.

Anyway, i just got the movie on blu-ray, and watched it with a mate. The picture quality is great, one of the best blu-rays i have seen, but the film was extremely disappointing. It is very well paced, slow, but seems to keep building towards some freaky ghost like moments, and whilst there are a few cool ghost scenes, and a few jumps and chills, the film finishes with you wanting what the trailer hinted at.....a freaky ghost story. Overall the film is worth a look at, it is well made, with great cinematography and beautiful locations, but rent it, dont be an idiot and buy it, cos i can tell you that you will do what i will be doing - putting it on the shelf and leaving it there.
