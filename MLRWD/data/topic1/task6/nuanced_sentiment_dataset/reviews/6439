In "Flame and Citron'" resistance members seem to have unlimited access to automobiles. We were in Norway during the war - not Denmark, but I can't believe that gasoline was easy to get. My father had a small Fiat and a gasoline ration at the start of the war because he was a physician, and made house calls, but the ration soon disappeared. I would think a Dane driving around in a car would be subject to constant checks. Trucks with Norwegian drivers were not unusual, but cars, other than official ones, were not. Then there were all the shootings. The Norwegian resistance (in which my father played an active role,) tried to avoid acts which might trigger too much attention or retaliation against civilians. I can't believe the Danish resistance acted differently. This was like a "Bonnie and Clyde" movie, in which the resistance members ride into town, hold up the town's only bank,shoot and kill a dozen people, and ride out again, as if there were no marshall or deputies to be concerned about.
