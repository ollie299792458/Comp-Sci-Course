I really wanted to like it. In fact, I was smitten with the character of Pumpkin, and his scenes with Brenda Blethyn and even Christina Ricci.

Unfortunately, I was completely underwhelmed by Ricci's performance. I love looking at her. Her features are eerily romantic and ethereal. But like many other actresses these days, her acting ability isn't be improved by her appearance. I'm reminded of Keanu Reeves, or Keira Knightley. I watch them, I tolerate them, but I am incapable of taking them seriously. I find that when they start talking, and are trying to invoke an emotion, they just take me right out of the moment, and I suddenly just don't believe in things.

Yes, parts of the movie were intentionally campy, which was fun, and Ricci can get away with her lackluster performance by overdoing it and batting those huge eyes of hers. But when the movie then plunges erratically into the dramatic, I find I only believe Pumpkin, who seems not to be retarded, but to have some sort of palsy.

I also disliked the fact that they OBVIOUSLY didn't cast any actually disabled people, only actors who seemed to have an awesome time imitating mental disability. Two of them I think were in the Mighty Ducks.

And that ending, with Ricci looking back at the camera in some ort of attempt at a post-modern end note, a la Orlando or Secretary. I get it! She's wiser. But unlike Orlando or Secretary, I have no idea how the Ricci's character learned the things she learned. She just seemed to believe one thing and then change all of a sudden.

I feel that the movie was badly edited, heavy handed and unfocused. In other words: long, patronizing and confusing. But kind of fun, I guess. I think it's worth it to watch Pumpkin and his mother.
