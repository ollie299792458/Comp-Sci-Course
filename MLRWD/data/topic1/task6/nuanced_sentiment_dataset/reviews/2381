Personally, I enjoyed, & continually enjoy watching 'Under the Cherry Moon'.  Under The Cherry Moon from all aspects is no harder to watch than any Bing Crosby, or Fred Astaire movie.  Granted, Bing & Fred have been in quite a few incredibly memorable films, always though (I will remind you), on someone else's dime.  The storyline of many of either Bing, or Fred's films were all written by strict formula, very rarely straying outside of the "Tried & True."  Prince, on the other hand, if I remember correctly, directed the majority of the film himself.  Most who have given reviews of this film seem to have had some preconceived notion of what this film 'should have been' like before ever seeing it.  After viewing the movie, you will see that it can be likened to the vast majority of older films by Bing & Fred, nevertheless, on a smaller budget than any of their films.  Now, with all of this said, remember this, not everyone will ever like the same things.
For those of you out there who do not understand what I have written, just simply understand that I have not given my review in order to change the minds of those who disagree.  I hope that this will provide everyone something to think about.
