I haven't seen the movie, and not sure I want to.  But I do think this idea is pretty cool. All I see is more convenience...I'm missing how these things will overfill our landfills.  Comparing apples to apples, we should be more concerned about the waste much more common consumers goods create if we want to make a difference.  Furthermore, I worked in advertising and we used to ship out CD-ROM and DVD based direct mailers (strictly by request...nothing like AOL's approach). There was more than 4x's the weight of plastic (and subsequent waste) in the DVD packaging than in the actual disc.  These flexplay things come in cardboard wrappers, which may be made of recycled paper as far as we know. In the grand scheme, you guys are making a mountain out of a mole hill.  I'm all for the environment, but let's call a spade a spade.  And if you're that concerned...recycle them.  My office building has a "techno trash" box where you drop of disc media for recycling - which is the only way we dispose of non-rewritable CD-ROMs that we've accumulated over the years.
