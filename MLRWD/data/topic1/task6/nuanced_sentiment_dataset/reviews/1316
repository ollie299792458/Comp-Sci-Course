The Shadow is well done movie bringing to life the early radios' mystical hero "The Shawdow". Holding true to the original plot Alec Baldwin plays the Shadow whos early deeds as a drug lord, lead him to a  Tibetian mystic. There, he learns how to use his mind to control others.  Alec surprisingly is able to relay the angst and dark side of the Shadows  inner self, bringing depth to this dark hero. Set in 1930s New York the  Shadow becomes a vigilante fighting crime in the city. However soon a dark  visitor from the orient comes to the city. Knowing the the same mystcal  mind control as the Shadow, he sets forth his plan to control the world.  This is where the fun and adventure begin. Supported with a great cast.  Penelope Ann Miller as the love interest, Tim Curry as the back stabbing  inventor and Johnathon Winters as the Shadows uncle and comic relief to  name a few, Add great cinematography and score and you have a first rate  portrayal of the original "Shadow" radio show. The Shadow is a  must see for those who like mystical adventures. For who knows what evil  lurks in the hearts of men, The Shadow knows!
