I was able to get a copy of this DVD early prior to the Tuesday release date and instead of listing all the matches, as they have already been discussed in other reviews, I will point out one Very Glaring Omission.

THE ROCK!!!

Being a Big "Rock" Fan I could not wait for the release of this DVD, and for the most part is has alot of great matches, one-liners and interviews. Sadly the Rock plays No Part in the DVD other than being in the matches themselves.

The Rock is treated as if he no longer exists. Starting with just the back of the package which leads you to believe the Rock is no longer even considered a part of wrestling only someone who defined it. Instead of The Rock introducing his matches we get only narration through this DVD set. No Superstar comments, No Feedback from Vince or J.R., NOTHING, Just a Narrator. Hell, even Bret Hart came back just to lend his thoughts on his matches and the latest releases such as Shawn Michaels and Hardy Boys have great insights and comments through out. Even the Stone Cold and HHH packages have themselves going through each match with many insights and feelings which make watching the matches agian even that more special.

So while I appreciate this DVD set and love the package in whole it was a BIG Disappointment to find out it's just 19 matches,the one-liners and the "Original" interviews(Raw, Smackdown & PPV's) with Nothing Else but Chessy Narration and not a hint of the "Great One" himself offering us some insight!!
