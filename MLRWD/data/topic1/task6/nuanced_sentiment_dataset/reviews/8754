Although I got the Ultimate Collection Disc set a couple of years back on Ebay I am glad they are now releasing the season 1 dvd.  I may hold off buying this disc set but check out the future seasons that come out.  In the case of the Ultimate Collection my favorites are: The First, Rainbow's End, Death In The Family, Mystery Man, 747 and The Harder They Fall.

Like someone said in an earlier post it is a shame that older shows have to wait much longer to have DVD seasons released than tired, brand spanking new, not as interesting shows that have just finished up their first season and they are immediately rushed out to DVD!!  That happened in the cases of Lost, Grey's Anatomy and Desperate Housewives.

Another thing that is odd.  It is a bit baffling as a fan for Universal to rush a 6 Disc set of multiple episodes then go back into season mode to put the episodes out in sequential order by season. But oh well- with a company like Universal it's all about the money!
