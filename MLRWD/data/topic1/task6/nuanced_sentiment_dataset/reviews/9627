You probably already know the in's and out's of this, so I won't go into heavy detail on the film itself.  But if you don't see this magnificent documentary, you are really missing out.
The question is can 90 minutes of birds (mostly fowl) in flight hold an interest to the viewer ?  Simply, put - yes.  Not only are we treated to seeing birds in flight from a short (very short) distance away, we also can admire of how beautiful the world is viewed from thier point of view - and how ugly it can become because of humans.
Although the filmmakers don't dwell on the fact the dangerous obsticles these birds come across, they make a strong (sometimes sad) point.  Lets face it:  A real true to life documentary will not 'sugar coat' the world we live in, but show us reality.  This is done with care, without showing us bloody details.  
DVD extras include a 42 minute "Making Of" featurette, a short 12 minute "insight" from the meanings of the film for a better understanding, and a full commentary by the filmmakers (plus trailers). 
Since the film has little or no talking throughout, the commentary is a welcome addition.  Although this might seem as an annoyance, this should be viewed as a documentary of image, and little detail.  
Do yourself a favor:  Watch the film first - then the documentaries later.  We find out some of the birds were saved in their turmoil - and some of the dangers were staged.  This, in NO way, shape or form, does this take anything away from the wonderous impact this film makes on you.  
It WILL make you view birds in a whole different light - and just might make you change your ways.  This is filmmaking at its greatest.
