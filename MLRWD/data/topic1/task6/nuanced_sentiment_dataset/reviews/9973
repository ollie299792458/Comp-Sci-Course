Why do we have to wait so long for Season 2?

Obviously, the guys at Fox think that the second season of Dynasty is not going to be popular. How much mistaken they are...

First of all, as everyone has already mentioned, it's the first season that Joan Collins appears (Alexis, hello??) and this fact by itself guarantees that DVD sales are going to be much higher than for Season 1. In addition, I can't help but wonder who was the smart guy who decided to release the first 15 episodes of Season 1 separately from Season's 2 episodes. Weren't you expecting that it would not sell as much as the next seasons? (obviously you guys have never watched the series you had been producing some years ago..) Even Warner released Dallas' first 2 seasons on one DVD set and enjoyed high sales figures.

Anyway, it seems that all Dynasty fans will have to wait for Paramount to take over in November. Let's just hope that they will treat the most addictive TV Soap of the 80s as it deserves - with respect!

And let's just also remind Fox of the following: although Dallas may have been hugely popular in the US, I believe that Dynasty was more popular than Dallas in Europe. However, Fox only released the DVD Set for Zone 1, ignoring all its potential customers in Europe (Zone 2). Pleeease then don't be disappointed with Dynasty's Season 1 DVD Sales - you made a great effort to sabotage the figures yourselves.

A big Dynasty fan from Greece, impatiently awaiting for the Second 2 Dynasty DVD Set release that will prove that there is still a huge audience for Dynasty out there.

PS Paramount, please, do not forget:

1. to release as quickly as possible every one of the next 8 seasons.

2. to release the 2 Colby's seasons on DVD as well. I believe that many people would love to own them.
