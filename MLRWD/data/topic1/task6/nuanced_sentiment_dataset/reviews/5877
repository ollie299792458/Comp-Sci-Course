I must agree with another reviewer, what a disgrace to the highly regarded and much loved TV series that so many of us still cherish.  In no way can anyone possibly fill Elizabeth Montgomery's shoes.  She had that special something, that likability that turned the show into an instant classic.  Don't get me wrong, Nicole Kidman sure looked the part, and Shirley Maclaine did too, but maybe if they would have had a real script, an actual story about the characters instead of, 'hey, lets remake the TV show and mention every five mintutes that the audience is watching a movie about remaking a tv show.'  I mean come on people, is that even considered a plot by anyone's standards?  Not mine.  Scream 3's movie within a movie was one of the worst excuses of a movie I've ever seen (and I feel the first one was a masterpiece).  Why in the world would anyone want to even try to remake-or in this case, tarnish-such a beloved TV show.  This is definitely one they should have left alone.  Just how fast this movie was gone from the theaters and put onto dvd just a couple months later speaks volumes as to what a snoozer it really was.  And, it also should remind us all why we love the REAL Bewitched show so.  How can you possibly replace Elizabeth Montgomery.  Can't be done.  And characters such as Marion Lorne as Aunt Clara and Paul Lynde as Uncle Arthur, they were brilliant character actors and can never be replaced.  The same should be said about Agnes Moorehead's brilliant turn as endora and Dick York's Darrin (don't EVEN get me started on the whole Dick York/Dick Sargent fiasco!).  It's almost laughable and yet very sad and pathetic that anyone would or could think differently.  Let's just all know how brilliant the original series was and quickly forget this trainwreck of a movie ever happened.  Sorry Nicole, but I think even you would agree with me when I say that Elizabeth Montgomery was the one with all the magic.
