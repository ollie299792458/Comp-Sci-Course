Well, I think this movie is pretty darn good. I'm 14 and this movie DEFINETLY shows what life is like for some 13 year olds. But mostly 14 year olds. I know alot of girls in my grade who are exactly like Tracey and Evie. All of the popular people in my school. They get toungue rings, belly button rings, they smoke practically anything they can get their hands on,they cut themselves,steal things,they have sex alot. It's amazing how similar tracey and evie are alike to girls around 13, 14 and 15 these days. Believe it or not but,a good amount of girls the age of 13 do all of these things. Trust me, I would know. I was just thirteen last year. And I knew alot of girls that were doing all of this. Even more now. So I think that this movie is really good because it shows all of the girls how it may seem fun and everything now, but in the long run, it's not worth it at all. And what it will do to you. I believe that this movie actually could help stop teenagers from doing these kind of things. Because they don't ever really SEE what it does to you. They just hear "It will kill brain cells,it can cause heart problems.." Kids don't wanna listen to that. The health affects. I think all of you who are reading this get my point.

 So watch this movie. And it does actually have a point to it. You just need to think about it.
