I didnot find this movie as a romantic comedy...

But, for sure, I think that this movie is a disgrace to American women and to the French culture.

American women are supposed to be tough, smart, and able to file a lawsuit against anyone for everything...

I could not believe a housewife sooo naive that after knowing her husband cheated on her, she wouldn't file a divorce, still wanted him and loved him so bad she became suicidal... goodness !!! her husband came from a wealthy french family !!! so, don't get sad... get everything, baby !!!

Also, I might not understand french security system... but this movie made french people look bad... a policewoman, after being dispatched to a crime-scene, still cared enough to put some perfume on herself (she was on duty patroling in her and her partner's police-car) ???? A man getting in the Eiffel Tower through the exit door, but nobody stopped him, and nobody had any suspicion until that guy took a gun out of his jacket??? that's just impossible to believe... after 9/11, shouldn't security system be strict everywhere you go, especially in a well-known place like the Eiffel Tower???

This movie is even a disgrace to other chick-flicks...
