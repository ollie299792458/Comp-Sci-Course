In a word? "Good."

This is a very moving film, which touches on many things -- not least of which is the role of the press in times of war. This ethical question has not become any less important with the Iraq war, and will undoubtedly increase in its importance in wars to come.

Overall, this is a very well-produced film, with very talented actors indeed, that will definitely become one of my most frequently watched films. The one thing that could be improved on, however, and that could've pushed this to be one of my favourite films, would be the plot. Not the plot of the war, of course, that is a well-stated fact.

No, I'm speaking specifically about the plot of the journalist-wife who goes into this psychiatric state, yet is allowed to travel into a war-zone instead of being prescribed psychiatric help. I do find this a bit hard to fully believe, and this takes up a bit too much of the film, in my opinion.

But still, put the popcorn on -- a good movie, by all accounts.
