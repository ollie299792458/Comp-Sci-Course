This movie is horrible.  I simply cannot understand viewers who give it more than the lowest rating of one star.  This movie was bad in every conceivable way.  At least STTMP was trying to be operatic, without understanding that most people (I am not one of them) find opera too long and boring, so it became all that it was trying not to be.  I loved #2 with Khan, really liked #3 because it was a transitional film to explain Nimoy being back as Spock, I loved #4 with the Whales because of it's message and its role in Spock fully realizing himself.  This however was dreck so bad that I prayed that William Shatner stay in front of the camera (a major miracle given that even though I loved the series, I think Shatner's acting blows chunks).  Luckily the studio allowed them to do #6, which was excellent -- Christopher Plummer still rocks, and set the stage for the Klingons' new position as friend.

See this movie only if you must see all of the Star Trek films.  DO NOT HOWEVER BUY THIS AS YOUR MONEY WILL BE BETTER SPENT ELSEWHERE!
