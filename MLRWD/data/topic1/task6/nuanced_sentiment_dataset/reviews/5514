When I first started watching this movie, I really thought I was in for something that spoke out against the Fred Phelps mentality in a strong way... or maybe gave us a direction of attack to put those types of protests to rest without us having to give up our right to free speech.  Sadly, I got neither one.  Despite the other two reviews here giving suspiciously high ratings of the film, I really can't recommend it.

I'm also somewhat disturbed by how law enforcement is represented here.  It's pretty clear that someone involved in this movie had something against cops based on the portrayal.  Granted, I have a bit of bias here, as I used to work very closely with law enforcement myself, so I tend to side with them more than not, but this movie clearly went over the top to try to put them in a negative light and make them look like idiots.

The more I watched, the more I hoped that the movie would turn around at the end, but when I walked away, I couldn't help but think that I should have done something better with my time.  Maybe Kevin Smith wanted to finally end a movie the way he originally wanted to end Clerks.  If that was his goal, he achieved it, but very little else.  As someone who really does like a lot of Smith's other films, I'm really disappointed.
