Okay, come on, you didn't really expect a parody to be scary, did you? But neither was SCREAM, and it was still a brilliant movie. Right off the bat, I'm going to say that I enjoyed nearly every minute of watching SCARY MOVIE.
So why only 3 stars?
For a start, not all the jokes work. Many of them are hilarious, from the simple stuff like the first "fart joke" to the parody of "Amistad"/"Titanic", and the way the actors recite their lines virtually verbatum from SCREAM, but in a way to make you realize just how ridiculous the lines sounded. Others however, like the cheap "Matrix" spoof and the "it's like we're in a movie" jokes, are neither funny nor original.
The creators of SCARY MOVIE knew that not all the jokes would work. Their answer is to throw them at you so fast that before you can start to really hate one, they move you on to the next.
With regards to acting, the performances are corny, and they know it. That's what makes it so funny. The actors who play Bobby and Greg, however, seem to be taking their roles a little too seriously. Anna Faris, who plays Cindy, does a great job of treading the fine line between being ridiculous and being too sincere.
All in all, this is an enjoyable movie. The DVD doesn't contain that much in the way of extras, but it's worth the price. The nice thing about this movie is that you'll find something to enjoy whether you're a SCREAM fan or a SCREAM hater, because it both mercilessly attacks it and gently pokes fun at it at the same time.
