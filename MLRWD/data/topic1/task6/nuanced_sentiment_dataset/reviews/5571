Clearly you're watching a master of his craft deliver one of his best, if not his best ever performance, in this delightful film!  
Yes, I would agree with some former reviewers here, that it's slow of pace - but there is no other way, such a complex, deep and thought provoking film could have been made! 
Sellers pleaded for almost a decade to play this part, ...and it is a crime and a display of ridiculous incompetence, possibly bias, by the Academy Awards organisation that Peter Sellers did not win the Oscar for Best Actor in 1980 for this role - ...I believe that went to Dustin Hoffman for Kramer vs Kramer, enough said!!
During the film, a fairly lengthy one at that, Sellers could have so easily broken the spell that was his character "Chance" the gardener - he never did! 
He is utterly, utterly, compelling and simply superb during the entire portrayal, ...indeed the part of the film when the aged and dying Billionaire, played by the excellent Melvyn Douglas passes away, is one of the most memorable in cinematic history -...as the apparent, seemingly non-understanding Chance, chokes with emotion with the passing of his admiring benefactor.
The film's end, with Sellers walking on the water, offers several interpretations - certainly friends I have known that have watched this film, have differing opinions to it's true meaning -  and perhaps that was always intentional, &amp; therefore significant to it's charm? 
Whatever, ...it's a brilliant ending to a most brilliant film!
