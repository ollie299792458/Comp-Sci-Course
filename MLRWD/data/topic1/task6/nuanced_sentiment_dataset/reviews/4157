I can't believe I bought this video.  The underlying premise of the movie, a Chinese martial artist marries a Japanese women who exposes her breasts while practicing karate, knocks down walls and destroys objects in her husband's house, refuses to obey her husband and finally removes all of her husband's martial arts equipment and replaces it with her own.  Is this a joke?  In this time period a Japanese (or Chinese) women would do this?  Oh it get's better.  She leaves him and goes back to Japan for comfort from her long time Nina (male) friend.  The husband send a letter to purposes a contest with his wife to see which is better, Chinese or Japanese martial arts.  Her Ninja buddy takes this as a challenge, so he brings nine of his friends to fight the spurned husband.  He must be the first Japanese Ninja coward.  Nine on one.  One of the 'experts' he brings to China has a twitchy mustache, and behavs much like Charlie Chaplin.  It's definitely a "what the hell is this?" scene.
I watched about two thirds of the film, then took it out, and threw it away.
