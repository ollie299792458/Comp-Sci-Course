This could have been a great film if Coppola had paid a little more attention to detail. What makes the Outsiders work is that when you're filming a movie that is from a particular era the people and background in the movie should look like they're from that time era. When you watched the Outsiders you knew it was 1960's Tulsa. The hairstyles, the clothes, the cars, the extras,the accents.
  This is where this film falls terribly short. The setting is supposed to be 1960's or early 70's Tulsa. Many of the characters aren't even dressed like that time period. Nobody seems to have an Oklahoma accent. Matt Dillon's hair-do is circa 1981 and he's wearing this bandana like Olivia Newton- John in the Physical video. Steve is wearing these hidiously huge glasses that didn't come into style until the late 70's early 80's. One glaringly obvious screw up is the scene where Rusty James argues with Patty as she gets off of the bus and they break up. If you watch closely as they are yelling at each other in the middle of the street a late 70's or early 80's Toyota Celica-type car actually passes them on their left side! I couldn't believe it. Also, in the last part of the movie Motorcycle Boy and Rusty James are riding on the bike together and the bike is an early 80's Japanese bike! What the hell!
  Francis Ford Coppola put so much effort into making this movie as stylized and detailed as possible yet I can't believe that he could allow these mistakes. If he had the details down like he did with the Outsiders this would have been an awesome movie. It seems that the great soundtrack and photographic elements were all for nothing.
