In later years, Orson Welles considered "The Stranger" (1946) his most impersonal filmmaking effort. However, the actor-director imbues a haunting noir atmosphere into this postwar thriller, which emerges as a telling portrait of small-town America. Beneath the simplistic surface of the Connecticut community lies, in the words of War Crimes Inspector Wilson (Edward G. Robinson), an "obscenity [that] must be destroyed." The "obscenity" is Nazi fugitive Franz Kindler (Welles). In the guise of history professor Charles Rankin, the clock-obsessed Kindler loses all rationality as Wilson widens his net. "The Stranger" is notable for the perverse relationship between Kindler and his newly married bride (Loretta Young), who learns of her husband's murderous past yet chooses to protect him. Robinson captures top acting honors with his understated performance, but the film might have been more intriguing if producer Sam Spiegel allowed Welles to use Agnes Moorehead in the Wilson role - thereby resulting in an offbeat gender reversal. Some of the film's darkest moments are weighed heavily in the first half-hour, with cinematographer Russell Metty (who also collaborated with Welles on "Touch of Evil") creating a shadowy, menacing atmosphere. Fortunately, "The Stranger" has enough Wellesian touches to transcend its conventional framework.
