I think the typically Japanese setting helped in creating suspense, it also made the killing of the king have a greater impact because treason was highly unlikely in Japan. The forest also provided a good setting for the meeting of the witch/evil spirit, because the density and humidity in the forest made it earier.

The plot changes by Kurosawa made it difficult to follow the connection between Macbeth and the Throne of Blood due to the fact that Kurosawa left out many important scenes, such as the sighting of the dagger in the air by Macbeth, and in place had extended scenes of MIfune and a co-actor riding around pointlessly throught the forest. Kurosawa also changed the plot so that Mifune was killed by his own men instead of by the opposing force. One adaptation that was fitting and had a good effect was the changing of the three witches to one evil spirit, this was a good choice because Japanese culture doesn't speak much of witches but more of evil spirits.

I think Toshiro Mifune's portrayal of Macbeth coulld have been better, for the fact that he did not portray the internal struggles that Macbeth had in the early part of the play. He also did not have the air of almost psychotic arrogance that Macbeth had, when his forces start abandoning him Mifune tries to stop them, where as Macbeth said that he did not need his troops. Isuzu Yamada's portrayal of Lady Macbeth was also relatively poor, although she still convinced "Macbeth" to kill the king she was not as forceful and commanding as Lady Macbeth, she was also too timid and did not reprimand Macbeth as Lady MAcbeth did.

Kurosawa could have also used slightly more violence to get the full impact of the story across, and to show how truly evil the killing of the king was. With regard to the end of the movie it would have been more effective  to have the two armies go into battle and then have Mifune's troops abandon him in the middle of Battle and have the king of the opposing force and Mifune have a duel.
