I'm a caver. I have been for close to thirty years. So when an occasional "caving" movie comes out, you know I GOTTA see it. Not because I have ANY hope someone will actually do research, or heaven forbid, actually consult REAL cavers. (NOT "spelunkers" mind you). I'm just curious. (Drive past that frightful auto accident and try NOT to look!)  Sadly, but predicably, this one does not disappoint to disappoint. I will say I wish cavers looked like that! Cripes, we ARE a gnarley bunch! Heck, I wish "I" looked like that! But alas, reality being what it is.....sigh! In it's defense, I will concede there was some good cinematography and nice diving scenes. I just wonder if anyone involved in the sets actually went INTO a cave and researched formations. I think not! It was not the WORST caving movie I've ever seen. (That honor would go to "The Cavern".) At least "The Cave" was shot fairly decently. I will say it's worth a look see. As for fellow cavers, buy the movie, get your grotto members together, buy copious amounts of adult beverages, and get ready to have a HOOT of an evening. Just make sure you buy "The Cavern" to go with it. That one is a HOWLER! Enjoy! BEWARE HODAGS! Now they're in the water!
