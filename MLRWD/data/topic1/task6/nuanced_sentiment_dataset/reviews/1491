Kevin Kline proves he is the Cary Grant of modern comedy in the film, "I love You to Death", as well as in the films, "A Fish Called Wanda", "Fierce Creatures", "French Kiss", "Dave", and "Soapdish".  But the performances by Joan Plowright and Miriam Margoyles are equally as superb as his, if not funnier.

Not only does Joan Plowright have all of the best lines in the movie, but she delivers them perfectly, with subtlety and finesse, and supportive facial expressions.  Who could ever imagine a Shakespearean actress and a baronness playing Nadja so convincingly.  I've watched the movie now at least a dozen times, and roll on the floor every time listening to her deliver her lines.  The only question that comes to my mind after seeing her performance time after time is:  why hasn't she ever been given the opportunity to play comedy before?

And Miriam Margoyles plays the perfect Italian mother, smacking Joey in the head after he had a bullet removed from it, reminding me of how my mother used to bat me in the head after some misdeed.  Her scene in the hospital is priceless.

Kevin Kline, once again, proves he is the king of comedy, as convincing in his Italian accent as he was with a French accent in "French Kiss" and an Australian accent in "Fierce Creatures".

Don't miss this movie.  Why it never received an Academy award beats me.  And let's not fail to praise the screenplay and the director and the entire supporting cast.  This movie is perfect.  If you haven't seen it yet, go out and buy a copy now.  But be prepared for laugh after laugh.

Joan Plowright, where have you been?  I love you, Joan Plowright.  Move over, Laurence Olivier.  You've been topped.  Five stars for Joan Plowright's performance.  And five stars for Miriam Margoyles and Kevin Kline.  Great performances by all, helped by a great screenplay and direction.

Oh, don't miss the introductory confessional scene:  it's hilarious.
