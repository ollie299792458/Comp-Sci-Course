First of all,you really can't get any better than the actors in this movie. Kiefer Sutherland who was just starting out in the acting world,did a fantastic job in The Lost Boys,and he was by far my favorite character. That could be,because he is just so Sexy and charming. Am I the only one who gets bummed when David dies in the end? No matter how many times I see this movie,I always discover new little things about it. I know it was made in the 80s,but I was born in 93' and this is by far one of my most favorite movies I've ever seen! Both my parents love it,but even they didn't show it to me,I found it all on my own. So glad I did! No one should live their life without seeing the Lost Boys! What a sad life that would be.

I can't get enough of this movie and everything it has to offer,comedy,horror and some very sexy vampires. The Lost Boys puts movies like Twilight to absolute SHAME. This movie shows you what vampires are supposed to be,fierce creatures of the night,who have to hunt to survive,trying to take everyone and everything with them,not powder puffs who worry about girlfriends and proms..LAME! Thank you Lost Boys for making my life whole. :-)
