I write the title "A Sleeper Hit" because that's what I believe the movie to be.  I admittedly did not want to see this movie when I saw the trailers in the theatres.  The movie just seemed too unconventional for Disney for me to consider.  But I []decided to watch it and was really glad I did.  This movie was a lot of fun and I thought that fun was missing from a lot of movies these days.  (I will spare the plot recap because every other review includes one.)  I thought that it was a fresh breath of air that I've needed since there were very few good movies that came out that summer.  I would highly recommend this movie and if not as a purchase, as least consider a rental.
On the level of story development, I believe it was well done.  Some have said rather harsh statements regarding the characters and story, but for some reason or another they may have not connected to the movie like I have.  I am not an orphan and do not live in a broken home, but I don't think you need this history to feel the emotion and understand the characters.  And while many have criticized the film for being a little violent, remember it was rated as PG.  That should have given you some indication of how the movie would be.  Just lay back and try to not be too critical because you could just be missing out on a great heart-felt and funny film.
Surprisingly, I haven't read anyone talk about the extra DVD features.  I think they are excellent.  They give so much insight to the process of making the film that even if you do not like the movie, you may appreciate it more.
Overall, this movie was a blast and well worth it.  I only tend to buy DVDs that I would watch over and over again and this is definitely one of them.
