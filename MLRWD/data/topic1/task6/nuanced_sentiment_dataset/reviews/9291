ok, i'll get right to the point. this movieis without a question, one of the more unknown, and ignored movies made. But that dosen't matter. this movie definetly did NOT get the credit it deserved. the last movie in george romeros dead trilogy. don't listen to the critics, this movie is a wonderful piece of work, with an extrodinary musical score.
the story follows a group of humans, an army captain, other soldiers, doctors, a helicopter pilot, and a radio specialist, who are forced to sweat it out below in a florida missle silo, while the living dead regroup above on earth. The doctors in the silo study the zombies they catch in the underground caves, under strict orders by the army captain, Rhodes. After all seams hopeless, the army men kill two of thwe doctors, and force the helicopter pilot john, to fly them out, and leave the lady doctor sarah, and the radio man, mcderrmont in the caves with the zombies, to be eaten. But after one of the soldiers miguel goes above, he let's a very large group of zombies on earth to enter the silo. the climax ending is probably the best part of the movie, so i reccomend this movie to any person who likes to be entertained. the dvd is out of print, but Anchor Bay entertainment will come out with a new version in March of 2003.
