Yes, I know there are people that love this movie, but they clearly did not see the Broadway version or hear the music from the cd with Andrea McArdle. This is an action paced movie and it probably appeals to those who like that kind of stuff, but for those of us who know something about music and are familiar with the original know that this is inferior. Read the bad reviews of this movie and that is what I think. Should have not left out some of the songs, should have not taken place 4th of July. I love Carol Burnett and she does do a good job in this, but a little too drunk. I think the writers overdid it. Don't rememberher being so much in the play. I wrote a review of the Disney version and it the Disney version is better than this mess, but not as good as the Broadway Version with Andrea McArdle. I haven't seen it, but I was in a local production with the Broadway version. They should have made Bernadette Peters a ditsy blonde in this, but she comes off too smart. They kept her ditsy in the Disney Version. I will have to say that the Disney Version should have not had a black love interest for Daddy Warbucks. I'm not trying to be racist but it just doesn't make sense for the Depression era to have a mixed relationship.  They should have gotten Rebecca Luker(Miriam the Librarian on Broadway and a friend of mine. She would have been perfect for Grace.Not too impressed with Ann Reinking in this version as Grace. At least Audra McDonald in the Disney version can sing the way it should be. Ann is more of a dancer. If you have never seen the Broadway version or heard the original or seen the Disney version you might like this, but it is inferior to the original. So save your money and buy the Disney version and buy the Andrea McArdle version on cd. Too bad that version is not on tape.
