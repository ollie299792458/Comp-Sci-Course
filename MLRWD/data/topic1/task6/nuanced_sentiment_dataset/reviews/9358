First, if you are uninterested in religion as a background for a movie you would not enjoy this movie. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. With that said, you do not have to be religious to like this movie. I am not religious, but I loved the movie because I enjoy movies if they are well made with a setting of religion in the background. I would classify this movie more of a mystery/conspiricy than horror. The actors play this movie wonderfully, and the settings look like they are on site, not some hollywood studio. The only complaint would be that there is much more traffic/people in Rome in real life. Other than that, is was visually enjoyable.

The story itself has more than one twist and turn. All of which gave you a sense of learning from the start of the moive. It gave you a feel like you were part of the inside of the catholic machine, not a viewer from the outside. This was really well done. I highly reccomend this film. I wish there was a book to this to go even more indepth, or a line of sequals to it. Sorry if this review was a bit general, but that was on purpose to avoid any spoilers for those who have not watched it yet.
