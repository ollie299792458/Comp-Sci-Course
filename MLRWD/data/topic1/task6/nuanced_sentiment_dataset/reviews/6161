For starters, I went and saw this double feature THREE times in the theater: once with my cousin, again with my sister, and finally with my wife.  Each time, I loved these movies more and more and appreciated Rodriguez and Tarantino taking such a daring step on such a clueless and idiotic American public.  As a hardcore horror buff, I found necessity in supporting an already-dead, oversaturated  genre to possibly help breathe some new life into it for would-be directors and potentially renewed interest in GOOD horror movies in our society.

Well, did it work like they had hoped?  Of course not, look at we Americans: we're fat, lazy, whiney [...]!  To those who did go to the theater to see "the Grindhouse experience" reborn, it was awesome, wasn't it?  To those of you who are whining about the films not being released together, please shut the hell up (I asked nicely).  These films were grouped together only for the sole purpose of giving a nod to the scummy days of late 70's exploitation flicks for a new generation of moviegoers.  Most of those films from the 70's were originally supposed to be stand-alone films as well, but they were grouped together to draw a bigger crowd for a movie-going deal.

Planet Terror and Death Proof are completely stand-alone films and were awesome in their own right, but they also worked very well together as the double feature experience.  Buy both DVDs and stop all of your whining about the release.  There are bigger fish to fry than worrying about how a DVD is being released, right?
