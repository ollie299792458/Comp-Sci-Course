Let me start with saying that, despite the overall premesis of the movie which I found rather degrading, unrealistic, and a bit confusing, I actually found the acting to be decent(well . .they made implausible personas almost seem plausible . .almost) Second of all, I must admit that I did not the entire movie . . .I friggin LEFT after awhile (I stayed for most of it as it turned out....)...I just couldn't take it anymore. The main dude, the Spanish "artist" is pretty much is a hedonist aka "man-whore" aka "man who is self indulgent, cares only about his own pleasure, and only gives vague facades of actual caring...

Main characters I shall mention:
*the main guy whathisface aka the "artist" or "man-whore" [I apologize if this word offends you in any way but it's true....]
*the main guy's ex-wife aka "the bipolar chick" (this is Penelope Cruz' role that was nominated for an Oscar . . .I can't remember if she won or not...)
*Cristina - American girl who gets involved with the main guy aka "the wild child" (played by Scarlett Johannson)
*Vicky - American girl who also gets involved with main guy even though she's got a "boring" American boyfriend at home (I felt so sorry for that dude) . . .what makes it interesting is she's introduced as the "prude" of the two American girls . . .yet she still gets with the artist... Lord knows why . . .he never actually seemed that interesting to me throughout the movie . . .It's the girls and their personas that really made the movie at least slightly tolerable if you ask me)

Basic summary:
*Artist meets with two American girls and they "bond"/ he seduces them/wins them over/whatever and basically, they both end up sleeping him at different times . . .I wasn't surprised that Cristina did, but the fact that Vicky's character suddenly did a 360 for a brief moment (in that she slept with the artist) confused me . . .Why would you sleep with a guy who's involved with your good friend and who also has a crazy knife-weilding ex-wife with whom he as a love-hate relationship with? I guess it's because the guy's just "that" wonderful . . . .And there's drama, drama, and more drama until the very open-ended finish of the movie . . .Seriously, it leaves either confused, flustered, or hungry for passion that you can't ever get . . .Does anyone /really/ want any of those? I would say more but I don't really want to ruin anything for the (desparate) souls who want to actually put themselves through this tragedy (at least I think it's a tragedy .. with a tad bit of comedy that you kinda have to dig for or be in the mood for..) . .. Maybe I'm a prude for not liking this film, so I suppose if you like the intensely wild, free, and erotic lifestyle then maybe you'd be more open to this movie than be  . .. I don't know . .maybe you should watch the movie yourself instead of basing your opinions on others' reviews [sorry if I sounded harsh .  . . I mean . .I'm just saying that because, personally, I've loved a lot of movies that other people hated and I've hated a lot of movies that others have loved . . .Everybody has different tastes...]

Honestly,I wouldn't waste your time with this movie . .There many other Oscar nominated "fish" in the "sea" (Personally, I enjoyed Milk and Slumdog Millionaire . . .I like Australia too, but I can't remember if it was nominated for any type of Oscar or not) . . .

If You're looking for a good Scarlett Johannson movie I'd suggest the Island . . . .

*If You're looking for a good Penelope Cruz movie (though I did find her role rather "entertaining" in this movie) I'd suggest Volver [Volver is in Spanish by the way] or Blow

*As for Rebecca Hall (Vicky), I haven't seen any of the other movies with her . .same goes for Javier Bardem (the artist) . . . though I've been meaning to see "No Country for Old Men" for awhile now . . .

*Looking for a good Woody Allen movie (director)? Well to be honest, this is the only movie of his I've seen . . .I think . . .

P.S.: This movie did make Spain look beautiful though . .not that I ever doubted that Spain was beautiful....
