I love a good gangster story, but this was one of the worst-made mob movies ever with the possible exception of Mafia!, which was at least supposed to be bad (and it even spoofed part of this flick). The Untouchables was like watching a stage play with an awful soundtrack that seemed to upstage every scene -- perhaps on purpose. The acting was overly melodramatic, and most of the shallow dialog was delivered tongue-in-cheek without any sense of spontaneity. DeNiro, Connery and Garcia might as well have been cartoon characters while Costner bumbled and mumbled through his lines. The film is full of editing blunders, even. It's as if DePalma was afraid to reshoot scenes that were obviously bad takes. You can see dead guys breathing, for example. And one ganger's shirt is splattered with his own blood before the bullet even hits him. Plus, the whole slo-mo stairway scene was so contrived it was comical. And as for Ennio Morricone's lauded score, I challenge you to name one movie he hasn't ruined!
