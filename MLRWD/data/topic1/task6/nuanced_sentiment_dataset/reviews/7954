I went to see The Rules Of Attraction when it was out in theaters a couple months ago, and couldn't wait until it finally came out on DVD.  Boy was I disappointed!  First off the movie isn't all that great.  James Van Der Beek and Shannyn Sossamon were excellent and couldn't have captured their characters any better.  But as for the rest of the cast; what was Roger Avary thinking?!  And if you haven't read the book (which is amazing...thank you Bret Easton Ellis) I don't think the movie flows like it is supposed to.  The DVD itself isn't worth the money spent, no matter how little it may be.  No deleted scenes, no fun little tidbits that were promised in the DVD, nothing!  The only thing that makes this DVD anywhere near "alright" are the many commentary tracks.  But come on, couldn't they atleast put ALL the cast on one and the crew on another?  My recommendation would be to take some time and read the book.  The characters are more alive than anything you will see in the movie.  It's also a very fast read so you can read it again and again!  Once again; Thank You Bret Easton Ellis, you're a genius!
