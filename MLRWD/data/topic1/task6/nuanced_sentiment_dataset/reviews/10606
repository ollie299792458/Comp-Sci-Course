First off - I love this movie. No, it has nothing to do with the sport - just the idea of the Corporate Wars + governtment-controlled libraries is enough to keep me glued to the set. Of course, the main story is quite engaging, and everyone plays their parts perfectly for this '70s sci-fi action piece.

Now, onto the transfer - it's visually quite horrible. Really. It seriously needs to be enhanced for widescreen TVs in the worst way. The film could also use some cleaning up, but I'll be happy just to be able to watch it without the image distortion created by a 4:3 letterbox being projected onto a 16:9 image. This is why I give this DVD a 3/5 - if I was grading it on technical excellence alone, it would barely rate a 2. But as I say - I like the film, and this is currently the only version available.

Outside of that - the sound is pretty well remastered, and the bonus material is surprisingly good for a 70s cult movie.  If you've never seen this, I highly recommend giving it a shot.
