Very cheesy & trite "formula" musical about a good girl who tries to fit in with the "cool crowd" that smokes, drinks, drag races and gets in fights.  Olivia Newton-John's vocals and Travolta's dancing are the saving grace in this film, as well as the endearing performance by Didi Conn as "Frenchie."
But that's as good as it gets as far as casting; the rest of the actors are in no way believable as high school teenagers.  Poor Stockhard Channing looks miserable throughout the film, in a role that is clearly beneath her.  Somehow it lends to the perceived tough chick attitude of her character.

To fans of the musical:  you'll be disappointed too, as so much of this has changed from the original to Highlight the talents of the actors of the time.  Even Travolta looks too old to play his role, and it is unbelievable that anybody knew how to disco in 1952.

What is most disappointing is the message that "too nicey-nice" is a bad thing, and you have to change and be more "morally gray" to fit in.

...the music is pretty lame, but in a funny way.
