This is just a mess usual testing some new drug goes wrong and its on for young and old. First off why are they biteing each other? heck they can't be hungry as Zombies are dead arnt they
 so why do they need food? they have some obsession to just either bite people who straight away (well in some cases become Zombies) in others take some time. They leave bodies half chewed they for some reason are not hungry as they do not sit up and start the biting process they just lay where they have been partly chewed. Hell these Zombs are fantastic they know where our hopefulls are fleeing to no matter where they are heading ,out in the country fine we will find our prey hiding in a shed gotcha hundreds of these Zombies running all over the place eating yes even though we know they don't need food someone needs to tell them. Now don'yt get me wrong I have hundreds of Zombie flicks some worse some a lot better (thats in my opinion) I payed $4 im Australia to rent this and what I got was a lot of poor acting some good efects I got the chance to see rejects from the olympic games fly through the air all I can add to what I have said is If I had payed $4 to buy this I would have felt robbed this is a top class clunker up there with the Dead as 2011 worst Zombie flicks don't say you have not been warned
