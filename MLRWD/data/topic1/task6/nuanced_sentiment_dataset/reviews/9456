Written and directed by the scriptwriter of the excellent The Usual Suspects, Way of the Gun has a conventional plot, lots of shoot 'em up action, and a number of lines which will stick with you for days.

The best thing to say about the movie is that it stars two strong actors in del Toro and Caan.  Sadly, most of the rest of the cast is doomed to playing caricatures and not characters.  del Toro and Caan are excellent.  Their conversation inside the cantina half way through the movie suffuses with poignant regret.  The two men learn quickly that in another time and place, they might have been friends.  However, the circumstances they're in place them irrevocably at odds. Although reprehensible people, the viewer starts to care about them.

Not so for the other characters.  They either play set-cast roles largely there to keep the plot moving or they deliver performances as if they were walking through their lines hoping to get quickly to the other side (the actor playing the second gunman is the epitome of this problem.)

There are some odds quirks about this movie to like.  Seldom will one see an inability to get a cellular signal play such a repeated or important role in plot development.  There's a very slow motion chase scene in an alley which is photographed beautifully.  The use of vivid colors at night in Mexico is visually arresting.

But if you want a serious plot with your crime thrillers, this is not going to be the movie for you.
