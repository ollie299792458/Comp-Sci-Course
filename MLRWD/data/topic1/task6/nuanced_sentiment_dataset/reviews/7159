I love baseball and have a great relationship with my father, yet found this to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

1. Ridiculously convoluted plot.  It had promise for about 10 minutes then completely fell apart.  Ease his pain? Seriously.  What did Burt Lancaster's and James Earl Jones' characters have anything to do with the movie?  Was Jones written into the plot just to spew off a few contrived lines about baseball?  And the doctor "crossing the line" scene was a joke at best.  The entire point of the plot was to somehow lead to father and son playing catch.  Wow, what a creative, inspiring ending.

2. OVERACTING.  Kevin Costner is a marginal actor at best, and the whiny frustrated farmer role is laughable in this movie.  Should I laugh when he gets "frustrated" with the voice?  And Busfield's rant/shake the daughter scene was pathetic.  And the "Oh my god! Where did these ballplayers suddenly come from?" expression was priceless.

3. Cheesy.  Tries way, way too hard to force the father-son-baseball-bonding theme down everyone's throat.  If Jones or Costner or the doctor would have spouted off one more sappy line about baseball, I might have thrown up.  But I guess some people like the overdramatic garbage.

After watching this movie with my dad, I felt bonded to him in that we were both cracking up laughing at just how bad the movie turned out to be.  I had high hopes after Bull Durham, but they were shot down about 20 minutes into this stinker.

"Ease his pain."  That just about sums it up.
