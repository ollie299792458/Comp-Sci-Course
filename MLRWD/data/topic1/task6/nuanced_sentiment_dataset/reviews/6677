I'm not any kind of knowledgeable about surrealism or symbolism or anything like that- I like imagery, and I don't care if it means anything. In this film, I got what I was looking for, but I also got a lot that I could have done without. The film is done entirely in a stark, glaring black and white, so that often you can't tell what exactly is happening, but often I don't think you're supposed to. There are some truly disturbing, morbid and bloody scenes, notably the opener with "God Killing Himself" and the torture and murder of Earth Mother and the Son of Earth. There were scenes that I didn't understand but which still affected me deeply- the twitching and convulsing of the Son of Earth, as though he were in constant agony even when nothing was being done to him, the lurching and shambling druid-creatures and mummers and their odd rituals of feeding the earth.

Unfortunately there were also endless scenes that bored me so that I nearly fast-forwarded through them (I didn't, though). There's only so long you can watch a bunch of druids dragging a twitching body across the rocky ground before you wonder where they're going with it already. I was also annoyed at the way Mother Earth seemed not to mind at all that her son was being murdered until they started beating up on her as well. She always seemed really removed from the whole thing.

It was extremely compelling, even in the most drawn-out moments. I'm not sure if I "liked" this movie yet. I do know that I was very creeped out afterward and needed to watch something dumb and funny if I wanted to be able to sleep that night.
