My previous review may still not be getting people to buy the film and a BAD UNAPPRECIATED EMAIL with VULGAR, DISTASTEFUL LANGUAGE!  In my opinion all DVDs are better than VHS due to digital sound and picture.  Why this  film more than others does not have a good transfer is beyond me.  To me it  is like all the DVDs I currently own (208). The sound is much better on DVD  I would think due to music always sounding better on DVD.  Widescreen  review rates this DVD with a picture quality of 4.5 out of 5 and a sound  quality of 4.5 out of 5.  To me that review is what I'm trying to get at.  Many people may not like the transfer but it is most likely the DVD will  not be re-released in the future and all VHS owners will have their tapes  worn out after a few years unlike DVD which never wears out even with  scratches that can be repaired with MAXELL SCRATCH REMOVER PASTE.  All in  all I enjoy the film and it being on DVD in WIDESCREEN THX.  To me it  performs like it should and I don't understand why so many people dont like  the DVD.  If so, then write the studio and get them to replace and  retransfer the DVD.  Its the studio that makes the transfer and releases  the DVD. This DVD may not be a great transfer as it should be but it  performs to me better on DVD that it ever will on VHS!  DO NOT WRITE ME  IF YOUR MESSAGE IS A BAD ONE!  IT IS NOT APPRECIATED and I am sorry for  reviewing what to me is a good DVD.
