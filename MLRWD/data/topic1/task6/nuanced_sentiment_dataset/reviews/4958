When I saw this as a kid i thought it was amazing. Just the whole "Predator in the City" thing was enough to convince me this movie was good.
I just rewatched it the other day and what the hell is Predator's motivation?
He goes around accidentally helping the police by killing the voodoo mafia. Why is he killing them? It's never explained as to why Predator is going after the voodoo people. I thought maybe they had killed or captured one of Predator's buddys or something but no they did nothing. Predator's just a racist.
So Predator goes around comittin genocide and eventually kills someone whose not black which turns out to be Danny Glovers partner. Danny Glover wants revenge and goes after Preds. But why was Predator in the city killing drug dealers to begin with!?

Anyway the movies sorta fun to watch and it has alot of great 90s dumbness added in.
Like when Predator says MFer. And the scene with the Jamaicans where they say "do you want some ganja mon?" which is the most cliche thing they could ever have a jamaican say. Oh and Gary Busey is AwESOME in this movie. He's the best part.
