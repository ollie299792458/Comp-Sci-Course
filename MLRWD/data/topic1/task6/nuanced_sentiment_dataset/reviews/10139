I was really looking forward to watching this flick but as previous reviewers have pointed out, there are some bad discs out there.  The first 3 times I popped it into my 360's HD-DVD drive it failed to recognize the disc.  By the 4th time I got as far as the Universal logo, then the disc locked up. The next day I decided to try one more time and actually got to the main menu... and then it locked up.  Sent back to Amazon for a replacement after I was unable to get any adequate answers from Microsoft or Universal after a couple of days. Will update the review if I am able to get a good copy. My drive oddly enough was able to play the "Children of Men" HD-DVD so my guess is that there are just good and bad copies out there from Universal. An insert in the case says you may need to update your firmware to play this disc, but I could not find a more recent upgrade to the 360's drive past Nov. 2006 (i.e. what was in my drive's original packaging).  I didn't even bother trying the standard DVD side because well... what's the point of getting an HD-DVD then? 8-)
