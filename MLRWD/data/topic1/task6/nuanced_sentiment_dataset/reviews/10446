The artwork was good, the characters were good. Some of the villains used really surprised me. This is not a spoiler: the Royal Flush gang makes an appearance.

I felt like the movie was going well and was pretty smart up until the main villain revealed his master plan. At that point all science and intelligence went out the window. The Justice League also disappointed me because they had everyone fight their rivals. If any of the team members would have helped Superman, who was fighting the only villain he was weak against, he could have easily defeated every other member of the Legion of Doom. Is Green Lantern weak against kryptonite and I never noticed? Also the position of the sun and the speed of light are convenient to however much time the movie has left.

Now to get serious--- it is not a bad movie. It feels like a comic book movie and it seems like some of the ideas could have been good but just did not translate in to animation well (any time there was an outerspace scene it made the universe some how feel compact).  Some of the characters were used better than I had ever seen them before, especially the cheetah woman and Flash.

This movie is actually very easy to describe and recommend. If you like the universe these characters come from you will like the movie. It is not perfect, it is not the best DCAU movie, but even the worst episodes of Batman TAS were enjoyable. This is a middle of the road Justice League story that begins and ends in a little over an  hour. Anything less than $15 is worth it. The artwork on the box looks good too.
