Bruce Willis has a total screen time of about 7 minutes, Forest Whitaker about 25 minutes, and Malin Akerman about 75 of the 90 minutes.  The Bruce Willis character isn't interesting, but Bruce does a decent job with his performance.  Forest Whitaker gives an interesting performance playing different personalities, but the characters are not intriguing or interesting.  Malin Akerman plays a tougher character, but her character isn't someone worth caring about.  This film felt more like a fun exercise for these actors. None of the performances are memorable, and neither is the film. The film starts to get somewhat interesting about halfway through.  Too many boring or slow scenes. The story is simple, but quite average, scoring a rating of 2.5 out of 5.

As for the cinematography, the camera work is also average with a few decent and great frames, but most of the film's composition is just plain.  A lot of dark and yellow tinted scenes. The film's look is grainy at times, and it does help the atmosphere of the film.  As for the music, the particular rock music chosen just doesn't fit with most of the scenes.  It sounds okay for two or three, but it really doesn't help the film at all.

If you are a Forest Whitaker fan and want to see his abilities, rent this. You won't be missing anything otherwise.
