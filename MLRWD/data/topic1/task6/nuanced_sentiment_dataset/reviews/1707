Well, it's a stylishly crafted film. Nice electronic music. A few interesting shots of Derrida himself. He comes off as a fairly down to Earth guy. He has a nice sense of humor. He seems happily married and is a grandpa. The Derridas have a real cool little crib in Paris and you get to take a good look at it. He shows us his book shelf. We see him fix breakfast. He has mixed feelings about the project. He's a bit concerned for his privacy and doesn't always like the questions he receives and will say so. The movie is itself supposed to show how it is impossible to really do a movie like the one it's apparently supposed to be. I don't know that I learned anything though. I wish they had done something maybe more "square" and focused on educating the viewer about Derrida's ideas. The film has excerpts of Derrida's text read to us as music plays and we watch various scenes. Whatever these are to mean, undoubtedly most people will not be sure. I wasn't looking for just a lecture, but was hoping to experience in this unprecedented glimpse at the famous philosopher some more light cast on his difficult ideas. Also what would have been good is a background on the tremendous controversy that has been associated with Derrida and deconstruction. It is a wasted opportunity.
