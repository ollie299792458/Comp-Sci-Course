With an all-star cast including Oscar winners Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman (who actually recieved a best actor nomination for this movie, and William H. Macy, and Anne Heche, a younger Kirsten Dunst, Woody Harrelson, and Willie Nelson, Wag the Dog is one of the best films of the 1990s.

De Niro takes the role of presidential spin doctor Conrad Breen, sent into action after the president is trapped in a sticky situation. His job, to take the media's attention off of the president and help him gain support only days before the election.

Breen must now come up with something drastic if he is to divert attention from the president, and with the help of Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Hoffman) will go so far as to create a state of national panic.

This film combines its suberb acting with an unbeatable script(nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar) and challenges, through satire, the way that election campaigns are run. A movie truly built to last, Wag the Dog is a movie that will send its message through for generations to come.
