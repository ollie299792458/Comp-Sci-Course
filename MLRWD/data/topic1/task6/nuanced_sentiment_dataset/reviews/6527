You must have extended memory loaded to play. All copies are the same, so there is no use exchanging it. I was waiting on my second copy when I found a HD forum talking about the loading problem. The forum members determined the problem is the way the disk was authored. The disk looks for enough memory to support the BD Live content even when BD Live is not enabled. I tried the second copy I received and it would not load either. I updated my firmware and it still would not play. I put a flash drive in my Sony BD S350 and the second copy loaded fine. The bottom line is you need to add extended memory to load this disk, whether your player takes an SD Card, Flash Drive, or whatever.

As far as the movie goes, I would have given it 5 stars if not for this issue with the disk. It's a great action flick with great special effects that look even more awesome on blu-ray. Excellent satire of blind alligence to government and military. I didn't read the book, so I don't have a problem with it not being true to the original story.

Highly recommended, just realize you will need to load extended memory to play.
