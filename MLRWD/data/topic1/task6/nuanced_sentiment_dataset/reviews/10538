This is the first time I have commented on a film; I could not stay silent on this movie adaptation of an exceptional book. There are books that are meant to be movies, books that make surprisingly good movies, and books  that should never ever go beyond the mind's eye of the reader. I saw Mr.  McCourt on The Charlie Rose show and he stated he felt "they" had  gotten it (the film) just right". So who am I to say  otherwise?
Many, many people were disappointed with "Tis"; you  will be exponentially more distraught by this movie. "Angela's  Ashes" was literally one of the greatest publishing successes of the  last hundred years. From a book that had an initial run of only 27,000  copies to a book that now has sold millions, it was an event by any  measure.
When the movie opened I was puzzled why it was in so few  theaters. Major movies open on 2,000 or 3,000, or even more screens. This  film peaked at 916 theaters, I believe, and went down from there.
The  young and younger and youngest of boys that played Frank were wonderful.  The Director Alan Parker does Ireland as well as anyone, and Emily Watson  was wonderful as well. But a visually depressing Ireland is not enough to  bring the film off. Everyone involved knew they were making a film that  would have an audience with expectations impossibly high; it would be a  remarkable task to even come close to meeting them. Whoever made the final  call on go or no go, should have said no.
The movie-going public said  don't bother, theater owners did not place it on their very valuable  holiday season screens.
The movie went no place commercially and that is  all the commentary this film needs. Whatever vision of "Angela"  resides in your mind, keep it, embrace it, and love it, for this film will  only detract from what you already have.
