This film is for those who enjoy films with strong, realistic portrayals of real people in extraordinary circumstances. Which is the case of Ray Liotta and Jason Patric's characters: two cops, which are totally opposite in the way they behave and handle things.
 Liotta's character has passed the thin line that divides a man in control of his emotions and respectful of law and authority, and one who cannot or doesn't want to do things in the right way: he simply has lost interest, and has too much rage to give a damn about things, so, to him the end justifies the means. But the problem is that there is no way in which this character can get rid of his demons, there isn't a way in which he can redeem himself, not with the way he decided things should be done.
 Patric's character, on the other side, also has a conflicted concious, but still believes in doing good. And to him, the end does not justify the means. He is a man who still has something to look up for, something to cherish, and does whatever he can to preserve things that way, no matter how hard things get.
 This is a film about these two cops and their struggles within themselves and their antagonistic way in which they see things should be done. But here there are not good or evil people; there are not black and whites; but there is only one way to make things at least a little better.
