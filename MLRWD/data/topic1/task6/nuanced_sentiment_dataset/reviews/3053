The Darkest Hour has some of my favorite younger actors in it. Emile Hirsch has surprised me regularly with his talent and Max Minghella is a very promising up and comer. Also being a big fan of sci-fi and end-of-the-world type movies, I naturally assumed this would be a winner.
The first half of the movie sets up a very interesting premise. Invisible invaders who hunt humans by detecting their body's electric current. There's even a few really great ideas here an there, like a microwave gun that stuns the aliens. Sure, you have to be a little forgiving with the science of it all, but I preferred to think of it as a little more serious Ghostbusters weapon.
The problem with this movie isn't the nonsense explanations for why the aliens invade or the ridiculous microwave gun or really anything to do with the general story. The problem is there's ZERO reason to care. The characters interact in the most dull way 90% of the time, and the rest of the time they're being completely unreasonable. You start to realize that any time the movie needs to create some drama, they'll have a character run off for the most ridiculous reasons. Besides the first 10 minutes of the movie, I don't think a single character dies from something besides their own stupidity.
Correction- it seems half the characters die because the russian girl doesn't know which way is up. In fact, The Darkest Hour has some of the most vapid female characters I've ever seen in cinema. They're simply there to get into trouble.
Overall: I loved the concept. The special effects were neat and there are some genuinely intense moments. This may have been a decent movie if the actors could have sold their performances better. I guess that's the problem with sticking the entire cast in front of a green screen for the majority of a movie.
