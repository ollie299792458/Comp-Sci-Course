This movie moves along without notice of the audience. It appears frantic and desperate in its storytelling.  We are expected to jump right in and take a ride with the various characters.  The two main characters work with each other as assassins and they are only seen together once through the whole movie.  However, there is a kind of love story in their relationship, because the two of them seem so perfect for each other.  Yet, fate keeps them permanently apart.  The story diverts immediately and we start to learn about an ex-con, who is mute and very funny and for a while takes your mind of the almost monotonous tragedy of the other two characters.  An unrequited love story begins between our male assassin and a woman he knew long ago and forgot about and meets again by chance in a McDonald's restaurant.  Just like the mute this woman offers humor in an otherwise bleak story.

I loved the music which helped move the story along.  If you closed your eyes and listened to the music(because you couldn't understand the language without the subtitiles) you could tell what part the movie was playing.  A delightful movie, that left me hoping one of our characters would find love even though they seemed so hopeless.
