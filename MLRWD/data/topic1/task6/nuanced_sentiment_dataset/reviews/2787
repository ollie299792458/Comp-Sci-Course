SOME MINOR SPOILERS. Just a short review of this film. It is exceptionally deep at multiple levels.  As the screen writer's review pointed out, it delves into the Everyman's fears, and does so in the context of the comma.  It makes one really think about chronic vegatative states and consiousness. The intro (a falling to the ground dream sequence) folds in quite eloguently with the ending of the film.
The acting is very good. Welome Back Kotter's Lawarence Hilton Jacobs.... you will never think of him in the same way after seeing this film. There are multiple levels of symbolism in the film as well...social, political, racial, and even biblical/religious.  Being a person that is very interested in medicine and the profession,in general,  I particularly enjoyed one of the subthemes dealing with insurance and the hospital industry.
The symbolism in the film is plentiful. For example, the religious references to the 12 apostles, the Last Supper, Judas.  It is a horror film for a very intellegent audience. Even objects like the knife holder serve to foster the film's use of symbolic references.  Hats off to the entire writing and screen writing team.  If you enjoyed Jacob's Ladder, you will enjoy this film as well....The atmosheric environments, particularly those in the hosptial, are very effective and visceral.
One warning: the film is quite graphic (I saw the UNRATED version) and this may offend certain viewers.
