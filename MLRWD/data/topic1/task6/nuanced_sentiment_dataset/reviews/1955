Ever since I bought the Battlestar Galactica complete series I'd been thinking, "What happened to that episode with Starbuck stranded on a planet??  And what about those flying motorcycles on Earth??"  I'd almost convinced myself that I'd imagined them, since I did own the "complete series."  Well, here they are.  I was 6 years old when this series came around and it didn't enjoy the reruns of the original Battlestar Galactica, so my memories of Troy and Dillon (the new Starbuck and Apollo) were sparse at best (it's like when Dukes of Hazzard had those other cousins show up or Airwolf had a whole new cast suddenly show up....crazy 80's TV clones).

Overall the episodes are pure low budget 80's sci-fi trash-- vaguely reminiscent of Star Trek IV in its disturbing blend of heavy handed environmentalism (the "Super Scouts" episodes) and high school theater quality time travel (the pilot episodes with a generic Nazi Germany romp).

It's worth the Starbuck episode though-- he's the best!
