Ok, when I wanted to see this movie,I knew it would be predictable,un-realistic, and a bit over-dramatic, but I didn't expect this turkey.I really think a good ol' lifetime movie is more entertaining than this junk.Jennifer Lopez is way too over-dramatic, and doesn't have enough sincerety to make this role believable.The plot is more retarded than anything that I could've imagined:This waitress meets this guy at her cafe, and within 1 minute you have a flash-forward:Suddently the two are married, and Jennifer Lopez("Slim")has had the ultimate rags-to riches transformation.Within the next 2 minutes,Slim and her prince charming have a cute little kid, and are the perfect family.Within 5 more minutes (maximum), Slim discovers that her prince ain't so charmin'.He's been cheatin', and she ain't likin' it.The rest is soooo predictable it hurts.The prince turned frog becomes violent, forcing Slim to run away and plan a "scheme" (oooh) of her own.The only expectations I had for this movie, were:I expected a suspensful,predictable,guilty-pleasure flick with a few twist and turns, and some cute lines.This movie would seriously flop on Lifetime,(and no,I'm, not kidding).This movie just blows in many different directions, and no the results ain't good.
