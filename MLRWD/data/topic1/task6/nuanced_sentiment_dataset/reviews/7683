I would like to point out the positives first. First the action sequences are well done. The moves were quick and decisive and I wasn't disturbed about the fake splashes of blood. The storyline is actually quite interesting as you find him coming into town to battle some gangsters. The actors did an alright job in comparison with what they had to work with.

However, the quality of the film does not seem up to par though it was released in 2003 or 2204. You don't really connect strongly with any of the characters including the blind swordsman. The last tap dance sequence was really unecessary and seemed out of place. It looks like they cut a scene from a completely different movie and just pasted it in there. One poster said one scene doesn't take away form the quality of the film but it does. One scene can ruin a movie - Notice the poster didn't state the scene wasn't bad or didn't belong there.

This movie is not as bad as some people are saying but truthfully it's not as good as some people are saying. It is an ok movie. It had good potential and didn't live up to it.
