When those people who create those historical documentairies will learn that the roman empire did not ended in 476 AD and that Romulus the little augustus was not the last roman emperor ?
 There were another series in 2006 under the same title which also splited in various episodes about the roman empire and ended in the same way by saying that in 476 the empire ended in the west.
 In these 2006 series actors could talk in the episodes. This new 2008 series have actors but u hear only narrators talking.
 Never the less are very informative series with episodes which cover untold before stories of gaius marius against the barbarians in 110 BC, of the slaughter of three roman legions in 9 AD, of the lives of the emperors decius (249-251) and aurelius (270-275) and of the generals stilicko (in power from 395-408), ricimer (455-472), aegidius (455-465), majorian (emperor from 457-461) and finally of the events which happened in 476 of the deposition of romulus by odovacar in the 4rth of september in 476 BUT as i said before romulus was not the last roman emperor cause in the east zeno was emperor in new rome spoke latin and he and his successors were still recognized roman emperors by the western elites who minted coins bearing the emperors' names until 800 AD when charlemagne was crowned a new western roman emperor successor NOT to romulus but to the latest eastern emperor constantine VI (780-797). The real last western roman emperor was charles the fat who was deposed in 887 AD in the west and in the east the last emperor was constantine XI Palaiologus who was killed in 1453 AD.
 There is proof of what i'm saying even in these 2008 series i'm writing my review now as in the end they admited odovacar sent the imperial insigmia of romulus to zeno the eastern emperor thus acknowledging him as a sole roman emperor and even if this action meant the failure of the west it also meant that NOW IN 476 AD THE EMPIRE WAS UNITED AGAIN UNDER THE SOVEREIGHNITY OF THE EMPEROR REIGHNING IN NEW ROME AS IT WAS 150 YEARS AGO UNDER THE REIGN OF THE FIRST CONSTANTINE (324-337) AND 100 YEARS AGO UNDER THE REIGN OF THE GREAT THEODOSIUS (379-395).

 ENOUGH SAID (Any comments welcomed)
