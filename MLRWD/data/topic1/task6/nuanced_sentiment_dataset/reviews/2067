This movie critiqued modern family and how in general we look at how thanksgiving is supposed to go within our families. Commonly things don't go as well as we would like them to. In the movie there are several families who live on the same block of different races and ethnicities and are not directly connected. They all go through things that are very uncomfortable. I think the film is showing that we need to embrace our families no matter what happens between our families. It is common for families to have tension between each other and common for silly mistakes to happen in a kitchen like burning or dropping to turkey. This was a very cleverly done movie. You get a great sense of a deeper connection that the human race holds as individuals. It shows our common bond with family and the problems that come up and often show a lot during the holidays when the family is together. It had an interesting way of showing different ethnic groups that live on the same block and probably don't think much of each other or their lives. The human race is deeply connected with each other even more then we really see or might never know. I think the movie critiqued the saying " It's a small world."  There were a lot of suspenseful a funny parts. It was not the best but pretty good.
