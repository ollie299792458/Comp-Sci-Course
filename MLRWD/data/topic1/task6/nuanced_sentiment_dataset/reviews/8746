Okay, I was suckered into buying the blu-ray of this film by all the hype I had heard. Nominations and more nominations...for 2+ hours of hand-held, formulaic, standard war movie, no better and probably no worse than the hundreds of war movies that have preceded it over the past near-century. What was all the fuss about? It is one of the first films to deal graphically with the ongoing Iraq war, and certainly it brings home the "war is hell" cencept that we've been seeing forever. After a nerve-wracking opening scene, and the introduction of the excellent Jeremy Renner as the bomb-crazed hotshot, the film begins to falter, and the dreary writing and predictable plot points stop the film dead in its tracks. The blu-ray itself is nothing special; the constant motion of the camera negates the potential sharpness of the photography. THE HURT LOCKER as Best Picture? AVATAR??? Let's hope for UP IN THE AIR; not the greatest film ever made but very entertaining, and moving at times too. I was neither entertained nor moved by HURT LOCKER.
