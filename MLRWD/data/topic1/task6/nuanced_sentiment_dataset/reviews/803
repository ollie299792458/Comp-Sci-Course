I've lived very close to the city my whole life (probably 5 miles) and have been there very often. So when I first heard about this documentry I couldn't wait to see it because this was the most historic event I have ever been alive to see (and probably will ever see). I'm now 20 years old and was 19 on 9/11. Although, I do have to admit that I thought they would just show a whole bunch of images that everyone has seen on TV. I was so wrong. What I saw was so unbelievable. Words couldn't discribe how horrific alot of the images were. 
The documentry of 9/11 was originally supost to be a documentry of a person becoming a fireman in one of the New York City fire departments (Engine 7 Ladder 1). Two French brothers were the filmmakers. It starts in early June 2001 with basic training and goes through the life of a fireman all through the summer (until 9/11) It was originally aired on CBS on March 10 and was hosted by Robert DeNiro.
This documentry is very informative (and as one might expect) has very disturbing images. It shows so much like both planes crashing into the World Trade Center, both of them collapsing, inside the World Trade Center (when the attacks were occuring),lots of fottage of the recovery effort,and lots of interviews with the firemen of Engine 7 Ladder 1. 
I usually only write reviews on movies, but this was definitly an exeption that I wanted to make because it was so good and so important event that had happened. 9/11 is definitly one of the best documentries I have seen It is definitly worth to buy especially for the historic point of view and to see first hand what people actually went through. It's a piece of history that every American should have in thier home.
