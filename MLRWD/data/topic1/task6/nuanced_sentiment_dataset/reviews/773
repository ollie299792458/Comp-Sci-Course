i don't see how this movie made theaters. it was horrible. the first 2 mummy movies are like my favorite movies but this ruined the great series.
the original actress that played Evie left because of script problems and i can see why. i actually had to pause the movie to see why she wasn't in it. after hearing why she left made the movie a lot more bearable.
anyways the script was bad; Jet Li has barley any lines, there is no connection between Rick and Evie, the lines sucked, and where is alex's accent? and how did everyone wind up in china? i thought everything was based around egypt and such. it just so happens that Johnathan owns a bar right down the street from the museum that the emporer was awoke from. and where is the past connection to the last mummy movies?
 it is downright horrible. from the first 2 mummy movies, you would never have guessed rick and evie having relationship troubles. and yet the script includes it, i dont see how they could have problems. and what was the deal with the ending? evie's brother says he is going to peru and then the screen starts to fade and it says "soon after mummies are found in peru" WTF? that was unexpected and that ruined the movie for me. that ending could have been better (a lot better) then what it was. i am going to hate to see the next 3 mummy movies. hopefully someone gets fired or does some actual work (or maybe they put Rachel back as the mother) because the producers ruined the mummy franchise by this movie.
