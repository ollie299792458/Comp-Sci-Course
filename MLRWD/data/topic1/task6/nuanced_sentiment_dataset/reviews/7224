It's nice to see all these movie fans gushing about how great they think Blade II is, but as a mature male I must admit to a certain disappoinment at the complete lack of sexual tension between vampire hunter Blade and the leather-clad vampire babe played by Leonor Varela. One of the things that made the original Blade so entertaining was the interaction between Snipes and N'Bushe Wright. Compared to Wright, Varela's character is cold and dead. And it's not that Varela doesn't know how to be sexy. Critics raved about her steamy performance in Cleopatra. Director Guillermo Del Toro basically dropped the ball. I mean, if you are going to dress a dark-haired beauty in full-length black leather, the least you can do is to make the outfit snug. Even teenage movie fans know that sex has been an essential element of vampire culture since the very beginning. It's absence leaves a gaping hole that Del Toro tries to fill with buckets of vampire guts, but it doesn't work. When Varela's character dies at the end, I didn't feel pity or regret, because she never really came alive as a character. To sum up, let's just say that while Blade II may be a good action flick, it's not a good vampire flick.
