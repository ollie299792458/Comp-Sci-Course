I don't have proof that Tucker ever belonged to a fraternity, but he sure behaves like an ex frat boy.

That said, and he being an ***hole as a given, this book is well worth reading, if you like reading about drunks gone bad (wait, drunks are ALREADY bad, aren't they?).  The chapter in which Tucker visits Odessa, Texas (nearby Midland former home of George W. Bush) and drinks beer with some rednecks as they round up a couple of goats made my ribs hurt I laughed so hard, but the part where he goes to the hockey game and picks a fight with the mascot brought tear to me eyes.  I don't think I've cried--er, laughed--so hard in my entire life.

Basically, lots of fornication and inebriation, not necessarily in that order.  Usually it goes like this.  Tucker goes to a bar, meets a "chick," they get drunk and go to his/her place managing to avoid the cops along the way and culminate the occassion with wild, drunken sex.  Both sides try not to vomit, although at times that is not possible.  The next morning he runs away, if possible, so that he can repeat the process with a totally new and (unsuspecting?) woman the next evening.

I give this book three stars because as funny as he is, I think that Tucker doesn't set a very good example for anyone and I don't necessarily condone this sort of behaviour so I'm withholding two stars.  But, he is brutally honest, even though he's a brutally honest ***hole.

So, he's gonna go down under where it's 500 degrees.  Good thing they serve beer there.
