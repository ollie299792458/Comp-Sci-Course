Oh dear. This isn't really an Ilsa film, but was changed at the last minute, as Dyanne Thorn was playing such a similar character it seemed daft not to cash in. As a result, all references to the character's name on the  soundtrack and the titles have been sloppily altered. It really wasn't  worth  the trouble, as this is a very feeble continuation of the series, by  famous hack Jesus Franco, who has trebled the amounts of naked female flesh  on show, but drastically reduced all the other elements that made the films  interesting. For the record, this film sets Ilsa in some kind of  prison/reform school for wicked women, where she presides over staff and  inmates alike with absolute power. There are long scenes set in showers,  bedrooms, toilets, you get the picture, but very little cruelty, which is  after all what we expect. Dyanne Thorn looks great as ever, even as a  redhead instead of icy blonde, but the camera work is so shoddy, and the  make-up effects are so diabolical (check out the climactic "death by  hands and teeth" scene - pathetic!) that its really not worth  bothering.
