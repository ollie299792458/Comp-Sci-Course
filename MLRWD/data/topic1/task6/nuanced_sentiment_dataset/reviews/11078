I was a bit skeptical about watching this movie because I had heard it was a "chick flick".  Not that there's anything wrong with that!  Well, there wasn't.  Hitch was great and the pairing of Kevin James and Will Smith was surprisingly good.  I think Kevin James steals the show with his dance scene and overall hilarious acting, but Will Smith does make it funny as well.  The storyline got a bit weak at times, but there's only so many ways you cn try to camoflauge the "boy meets girl, boy and girl like each other, boy messes up, boy and girl patch things up and live happily ever after" storyline.  I never stopped laughing, which was the most important part, so it was well worth the time devoted to a pretty good "chick flick".

As for the UMD format, I think I'm done exploring that avenue.  The DVD version of this movie is conciderably cheaper and can be watched on your home DVD system, a portable DVD system (which is way cheaper than a PSP) or other ways.  The UMD image quality was great; crisp and clean with out any glitches.  The sound, even with the "UMD volume" at +2, was barely audible when the actors talked at a normal level.  Forget whispers, which were a lost cause.  Headphones were the only way to go, and sometimes I just don't want to wear them.  The other issue I have was a lack of any extras.  The movie, and ONLY the movie for this price was asking an awful lot.  I know the format can only hold a certain amount, but other UMD's have offered a small but appreciated gag real or something.  Stick with DVD versions.
