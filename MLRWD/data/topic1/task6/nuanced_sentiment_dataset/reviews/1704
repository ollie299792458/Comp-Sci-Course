Fabulous show. Both superb. Finally, a chance to guess at Blind Faith potential. Winwood`s voice, at times, struggles and the diction is hard to follow and Clapton tends to repeat certain sections, possibly, too much.
However, the versions of Little Wing and Voodoo Chile are magnificent. On Voodoo Chile, Winwoods vocals are majestic and Clapton`s growling, understated riff playing are menacing and Hendrix-like. When they reach the chorus line, it doesn`t get any better....The finest blues singer in top form, still with that distinctive Ray Charles echo and the greatest axeman soaring beautifully...and what about the Hammond organ, shrill and fruity. It`s all like a slow version of the Winwood classic Gimmie Some Lovin`.
I would like to have heard the Clapton classic Badge and Winwood`s I`m a Man. It`s marvellous to hear two 60 year olds playing great music and not safe, middle of the road stuff. Epic concert.
The DVD was excellent..well worth it and the cameramen were patient, all the time. Great close ups of both men. Far better than being there and seeing dots perform. The second DVD was interesting and some of the old footage of Blind Faith and Traffic brought back memories, as did the stills of the Spencer Davis group.
