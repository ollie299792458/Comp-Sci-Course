If you have never seen this movie, you are in for a treat!

After having watched "GLORY" for the 40th time, it reinforced these key points: At every turn, whether it was clothing, food or pay, the Civil War, African American soldier was at best given 2nd rate treatment. Despite this, he was still expected to perform like any other soldier in the Union Army.

A common re-occurring theme throughout the movie is how each character would boldly (or reluctantly) step forward to accept greater responsibility and in the end evolve into a stronger person. Examples of this: Colonel Shaw accepting command of the 54th, Morgan Freeman's character reluctantly accepting SGT stripes, an illiterate, freed slave learning to read, Thomas refusing to be sent back despite being shot and in one of the greatest moments in the film, Private Tripp lifting "Old Glory" from a fallen soldier's hands despite a lifetime of beatings by slave masters and having a long standing Hatred for anything he considered "White".

In a sense, this movie wasn't really about a war with the Confederacy. It was instead, a movie about a collection of separate personal battles. In the end, each man doing their best to overcome their individual "weaknesses" or doubts to contribute to the greater Good. A character whom I most strongly associated with was Andre Braugher's  "Thomas". The character was a soft spoken, intellectual who had great difficulty evolving into a soldier. In the end, he exempified the best of the 54th.

My compliments to the producers and actors for creating what I consider the Greatest "War" film of all-time
