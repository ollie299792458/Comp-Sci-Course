This movie is a pasted together bore with actors parodying themselves and the funny wedding movie genre - but not well. What makes the audience laugh are the sleazy sex jokes. Two sleazy guys - godsons of Steve Martin's and Dan Akroyd's "wild and cra-ay-zee guys - live out some adolescent's dream: victimizing women by telling lies, acting deceptively and generally being jackasses. (Only at the end with the pathetic figure of Will Ferrells' "Chaz," who victimizes women at funerals, are the Sleazies held up to light. They are actually very sad.) This is funny? Edifying? Entertaining? And the schtick: Vaughn getting buckshot in the butt? Tied to a bed and raped? (Remember "American Pie" and "band camp"?) Jacked off at the dinner table? God, that was so funny! How lame was it that they end up essentially going back to self-admitted hell?

This movie is a money making formular: it is your summer neanderthal special (just like "American Pie" and going all the way back to "Porky's). You who liked it - well, Hollywood will keep on sheepherding you until you ask for better. Until then, keep handing over your money. Me, I'm asking for mine back.
