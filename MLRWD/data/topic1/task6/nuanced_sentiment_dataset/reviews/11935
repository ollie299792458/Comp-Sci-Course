Well, I shelled out over $100 for these a couple of years ago - they were cheaper than they are listed now.  The sad part is that it was a gift for my wife - this is her favorite show.

The problem is that they come shipped in these cardboard painted DVD sleeves that are color coded for each season.  The nasty thing is that the paint from the cardboard sleeves sticks like a residue to the disc, rendering them unplayable.

I used rubbing alcohol to clean the miniscule paint flecks and stains off the disc (because water just wouldn't do the trick).  Unfortunately, they fixed some parts but not others, and all the discs have huge sections that freeze or don't play, rendering many episodes unwatchable.

Amazon rocks - they did refund my purchase after I described these - but I have unwatchable DVDs.  This manufacturer sucks.  They should skip the packaging and just sell the DVDs in good old soft sleeves for less money.  Then  you'd actually get to watch "Everybody Loves Raymond.
