Many reviews are billing this as a funny World War II film. I'm not sure I agree, if only because 1) I don't remember laughing one time, and 2) its attempts at humor are interspersed with scenes of grave seriousness. Regardless, not a bad movie, but various devices leave you scratching your head and wondering why they bothered to put that in the film.

The film immediately opens with a cheesey chorus penned by Mike Curb, the Nasvhille record mogul. The music is so out of place I think the irony of it is completely lost. It doesn't fit at all - imagine watching Patton with the soundtrack to The Graduate, and you will know what I mean. The viewer will be tortured with the reprises of the opening music twice more.

The plot is a little goofy but believable and enjoyable. However, Sutherland's performance grates on the nerves after a little while (maybe because he does it so well). He portrays a hippy tank commander 25 years before his time. This is presented as social commentary from the perspective of 1970, but it seems just too out there to be accepted. His character is the most prominent comic foil. The other actors do stellar jobs, with maybe Savalas' portrayal of the gritty platoon sergeant the most enjoyable. Carroll O' Connor debuts an early version of Archie Bunker as the theater general. Despite the inclusion of this title in the Clint Eastwood collection, Clint is little more than a cardboard loner-hero type with a weak back story. Savalas, Sutherland, and Rickles have the better developed characters.

Cinematography is quite good. The movie was shot in Yugoslavia and makes full use of some stunning topography and burnt-out urban areas.

A silly Leone-style face-off at the end is another stab at "humor" that wasn't really all that funny and just seemed awkward and interrupted the flow of the rest of the movie. The highlight of the movie is a harrowing minefield scene.
