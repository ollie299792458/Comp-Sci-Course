While I don't think A Matter of Loaf and Death comes up to the level of the other Wallace and Gromit movies, especially A Grand Day Out, A Close Shave and The Wrong Trowsers, it is another charming W&G movie. The reason I say it's not 5 stars, is there don't seem to be any memorable phrases like there are in the other movies. My grandson and I can't even mention cheese without saying, "Everybody loves cheeeeessse," and we adore saying, "Come now, no need to be sheepish." But most importantly my grandson loves it. He's 10 and I was actually kind of concerned that he might think it's a little bit "kiddish" for him since he's grown up quite a lot lately and his tastes seem to be changing, but I've dropped in on him several times unexpectedly and he's got it playing in his room (albeit while he plays on the computer).  But he's got a hundred other DVDs he could play and those just stay in the drawer day after day, week after week. He has actually told me he likes this movie a lot. He's a boy of few words these days and so I think that means something!

I'm so glad the movie came out. I was beginning to think there would be no more and that would too sad! Wallace and Gromit are a VERY good thing.
