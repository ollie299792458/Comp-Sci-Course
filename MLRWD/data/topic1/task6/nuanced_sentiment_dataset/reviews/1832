First let me start by saying that I thought the movie was hilarious, it essentially allows guys to vent all the vile, asinine, and vulgar components of ourselves that we outgrow and repress in exchange for being a part of modern society, making it sort of cathartic in its own weird way.

Now that being said the title and trailers are certainly billing this as a romantic comedy for everyone and it simply isn't. I picked this up at blockbuster with my friends and a few girls we knew and got to watch as a room full of people was gradually divided between the men, who progressively reverted to our college roots laughing at every cruel and immature slight, and the women, who thought the movie was tasteless (some of which even pleaded for it to be turned off). I couldn't even begin to imagine watching it with kids because of the language alone. Still if the nights plan is to watch a funny movie with some friends and hang out, or if you need something to thrown on before heading out one night this will certainly not disappoint.

Ultimately I would suggest you rent it or get it on Pay Per View instead of buying it, it's just the kind of movie that you need to be able to defuse any blame for its presence and owning it won't help the market value of your DVD collection any.
