There are some movies, despite their faults, that will never lose their place in America's heart.  Turn on your television up to two months before December 25th, and chances are you'll see a miniature Natalie Wood (who later starred in both West Side Story and Rebel Without a Cause) gazing into the twinkly eyes of a dwarfed and frighteningly jolly "Santa Claus" (Edmund Gwenn), telling him sternly that she does not believe he is really Kris Kringle.  You've stumbled upon one of the most famous holiday flicks in history: Miracle on 34th Street, filmed in glorious black and white.
 After 97 minutes of sugary, cheerful simplicity, little Susan (Natalie Wood) and the rest of New York has been convinced that Macy's Santa Claus is indeed the real thing--the crafty old man even tricks the United States government into believing in him.  As you can see, this is not the most realistic of all stories... though definitely optimistic in its assumption that the Supreme Court has the compassion to rule that reindeers can fly for the mere sake of saving a dying lunatic.
 Maureen O'Hara, who plays Susan's mom, does an awful job as an actress.  Every woman over the age of 50 will probably dismiss my naive judgment of their former idol, but, like most bad actresses of her day, I think O'Hara is over dramatic and extremely unrealistic.  In this way, her performance reflects the entire movie--very cute, yes, but leaving you with a sickeningly sweet aftertaste similar to that which can be obtained from listening to an entire album of sappy "White Christmas" remakes.
