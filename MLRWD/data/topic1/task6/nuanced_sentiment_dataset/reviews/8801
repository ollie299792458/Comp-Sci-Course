I bought this dvd because I really like the two main protagonists. I have admired Woody Allen since 'Annie Hall' and 'Manhattan' and loved 'Lost in Translation' and 'Girl with a Pearl Earring', but I came away from this with mixed feelings. Scarlett showed in 'Lost In Translation' what a fine actress she is, but I feel that most of the r√¥les she has been given since have been pretty undemanding, perhaps concentrating on her physical attributes more than her acting skills. Although the camera absolutely adores her in 'Scoop', I thought her acting was also pretty good and it was not her performance which diappointed me, but that of Woody Allen, who abandons his usual laconic, self-deprecating persona in favour of some almost slapstick schtick. As he wrote the script as well, there is no excuse, hence the reason for the title of the review.

Having said all that, I still enjoyed the film. Hugh Jackman was his usual square-jawed, handsome leading man  and the plot was not bad, although a little contrived.

My advice to the reader - a film worth seeing, but don't expect too much.
