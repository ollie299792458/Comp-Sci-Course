Like many other recent comedies, the problem here is the script, not the actors. Jay Baruchel ("Knocked Up," "Tropic Thunder") is a likable actor, and Alice Eve is not just incredibly beautiful; she also has good comedic chops.

However, there's no way to watch this film and not think of the Judd Apatow films, like "Knocked Up," and how much lazier and less interesting this effort is than those ones. The plot is trite: the unattainably beautiful girl who might, just might, give the obligatory adoring, but unpopular, male a chance. Without giving too much away for those who have not seen the film, there are certain elements of the plot that are so predictable, it's almost frustrating to sit through. In a film like this, one doesn't expect to be completely shocked by the turn of events, but everything here is based on cliches that should have ended with the Brat Pack films back in the '80s.

I also have a problem with a lot of these comedies in general, the Apatow ones included: the women are expected to be really beautiful and the men are allowed to be total slobs. There is a nude scene here involving Jay Baruchel's rear end that was utterly terrible.

The film does have some laughs, mostly from T.J. Miller's character "Wendell." He is very funny in this movie and Jay Baruchel is always likable and Alice Eve is so beautiful that the film is not without some entertainment value; however, those strengths wear thin after a while, when it becomes apparent that they are all the film has.
