This was a family movie night feature, as are all Walden Media offerings.  You never have to worry about watching one of their productions with the kids.

Anyway, this basically looked like a made-for-Disney Channel movie.  It was fairly low-budget, which meant that the acting had to carry the water.  I think these young actors did very well in their roles.  It was refreshing to see kids playing outside all over town instead of being glued to some type of screen.  The bullies were not physically abusive (or even cruel hearted) as in so many of these *new kid in town* themes.  The parents were not complete idiots either, which was refreshing.  James Rebhorn as principal Boilerhead ripped his role off from James Tolkan, who played the principal in Back To The Future.

Bottom line, my 14 and 16 year-olds liked this movie, the fetching Mrs. Brew and I thought is was just OK.  I'll have to admit, my stomach was queasy for some time after watching kids eat worms for 1 1/2 hours.
