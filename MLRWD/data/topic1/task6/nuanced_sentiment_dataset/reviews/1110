I found most of the story interesting, the characters believable, and mission mysterious enough to keep me watching until the end. It doesn't rely on special effects to make the story, which is refreshing in an era when EPM (Explosions Per Minute) seem to drive the success of too many movies. I'm a die hard sci-fi fan and seeing the genre become more popular to general audiences has been a blessing and a curse; more movies in the genre are produced, but the stories are often flimsy. I give this one kudos for having a plot that was engaging.

Like others I'm not sure what to make of the ending. I'm fine with endings that don't necessarily resolve the conflict in the story arc -in fact I often prefer that as it generally seems more realistic than one that knits all the loose end and tosses a happy ending out to get to it and roll the credits - but something about this left me dissatisfied. It gave me the sense that there needed to be 10 more minutes of story. It was more like the mysterious ending wasn't quite long enough to make it compelling. To use a very controversial ending as a means of explaining this, I'll refer to the Sopranos. We didn't get any specific answers, but the loose-ends-ending gave enough information for viewers to speculate about what could have happened after the series officially ended. Love or hate the ending of the Sopranos, the writers gave fans enough to argue about for years. This movie didn't achieve even that. Even so, I don't think it was a waste of my viewing time.

If you like a story driven sci-fi plot, it's worth watching as long as you are also prepared for the extremely vague ending.
