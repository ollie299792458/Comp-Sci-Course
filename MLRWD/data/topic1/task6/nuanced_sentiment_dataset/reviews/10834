The comparison of this movie to 'Blair Witch' or 'Jaws' is unfair. Immediately this movie has certain tags applied to it that must be fullfilled or else the viewers walk away disappointed. One may be expecting certain traits of the movie that it does not have and miss out on what makes it very strong. This could be the case with 'Open Water'. While it will probably be more respected as time goes on and tags are abandoned, for right now this is a tightly woven picture that probably will not fullfill most expectations. It is not great by any means, and at times does not look good, but primarily because it attempts to be as authentic as possible. It appears as though the glamour was abandoned in favor of the cinematic effect-a respectable attribute of the film. It is paced evenly throughout which kept me from becoming bored. There is a buildup that one may or may not feel, but will realize at the end of the picture whilst emerged in the final scene. The scariest part of the movie could have been longer, but it is effective in keeping the movie going, and ultimately arriving at its climax. Take your time watching this and try to feel it rather than consider it or think about it. 'Open Water' is a firm fiting picture with great effort all around; it just is not great, but few films really are.
