This is one of those movies that I found prfoundly disappointing because it had the potential to be one of the greatest of the American Sci-Fi films and it blew it.
The movie is great in that there is an attempt to respect  the laws of physics and mechanics. So, an astronaut is lost because he  approaches a derilict spacecraft at too high a velocity to hold on.  The  others can't rescue him due to lack of fuel, and the lengthy startup  procedure for the spaceship.  I couldn't help thinking that in another  movie there would have been 15 minutes of death-defying stunts and whizzing  spaceships to rescue the astronaut.  I also thought that the ship used to  fly to Mars was very realistically designed.
The problem with the movie  is the requirement to basically watch a 15 minute home-movie before the  action begins, more home-movies in the spacecraft headed to Mars, and  finally an extra-terresrial at the end that looks like it belongs in a B  grade Sci-Fi flick of the 50's.  These shortcomings are enough to ruin what  could have been a great movie.
