Roger Moore should have stopped making Bond films after "For Your Eyes Only." That was his fifth and should've been his last. Instead, his last was two movies later, an abomination called "A View to a Kill." This film is littered with weaknesses that make for a painstakingly boring two hours. The most noticeable is Roger Moore. He wasn't that great of a Bond to begin with, and here he is far too old to be considered an action hero. The second is the plot, which is completely stolen from "Goldfinger," one of the best in the series. Next, we have that annoying computer expert chick who couldn't be convincing if her life depended on it. Also, the "laughs" in this movie are too frequent and too silly, making this film hard to take seriously. The films only merits are the casting of Christopher Walken and Grace Jones as the two badguys. While their characters really don't feel that menacing compared to other villains, the two do everything they can to bring out good performances. "A View to a Kill" is the very worst of the Bond films. Thank goodness it was Moore's last.
