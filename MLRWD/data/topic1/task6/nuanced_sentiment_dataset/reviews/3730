Be it a guilty pleasure, a rare delight, or a visual delicatessen, call "Airborne" what you want. However, one thing it is not is a bad movie. Sure the dialogue is a bit campy and dated, the whole cool of it is gone, but this is a movie driven on pure nostalgia. Come to think of it, this might be a movie for a certain crowd: those born prior to 1990.

Mitchell Goosen (Shane McDermott) is a California skater and surfer, who spends most of his times eating burritos or chasing waves. When his parents are offered an opportunity to study in Australia, Mitchell finds himself in Cincinnati, Ohio. Of course, this means: no waves. Instead, Mitchell discovers a whole new way of life.

With rising stars (Seth Green, Jack Black), "Airborne" is filled with a unique ensemble cast, that all work in the funny yet awkward scenarios. Shane McDermott is a likable protagonist and while his story is quite surreal, anyone who's ever been to high school or a small town can relate.

The score by Stewart Copeland is phenomenal and works with some of the breathtaking visuals, specifically the ending which involves an all out race between skaters down, "The Devils Backbone."

Hopefully this is released on DVD as the videocassette is expensive for such a dated platform. Nevertheless, anyone with cable or HBO is bound to catch this rare film. To be honest, they really don't make movies like this anymore.

Check it out over the break.
