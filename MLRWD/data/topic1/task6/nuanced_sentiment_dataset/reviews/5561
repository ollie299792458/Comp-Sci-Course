This is an intense workout, no question. But, in general I was a little disappointed. I had a hard time deciding between this cardio workout or his newer one and I think I made the wrong choice (I just placed an order for the newer cardio DVD). I do like Bob's style and his pep talk and the over all editing of the video. The shorter, balance workout is great; I just wish it was about 10 minutes longer. I get that it's meant to be quick, but it ends just as you're starting to get into it. The longer workout is also good in that it's tough, but I'm not a fan of all the weight swings. There are two lengthy sets of them. I have a hard time getting the form right and Bob doesn't really offer many tips. I used to workout with a trainer and even with her one-on-one attention I had a hard time getting the form right for dead lifts, so maybe the problem is me. Either way, it's left me with a tight lower back the day after performing the workout.

I should add that I do workout regularly and have about a half dozen of Jillian's DVDs so it's not that I'm new to this (if you like Jillian, you'll recognize some of the moves here). This probably isn't a great workout for beginners. As others have said, I'm also not a huge fan of the fact that the background folks are all out of sync. I get that it's an effort to teach us to work at our own pace, but I like to be pushed to keep rhythm with people who are more fit than I. I'll keep this DVD in my rotation, but it's not the "go to" cardio workout I was hoping it would be.
