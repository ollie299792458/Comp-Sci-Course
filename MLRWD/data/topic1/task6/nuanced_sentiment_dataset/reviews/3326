Yes, it is true Warner Bros. botched this dvd by releasing it in full screen format.  The Road Warrior is a classic, and these films probably deserve the sort of attention MGM gave to Mad Max 1.  I think we can all agree the studios have no friggin' clue what the fans want.
However, I bought this double feature for under ten dollars.  So what if it's junk?  It's under ten bucks!  No skin off my back.
Also, may I be so bold to say that a part of me believes these films to be, dare I say, even better in this sloppy, scratchy full screen format.  I mean, regardless of their legendary cult status, and despite my own personal love for the post-apocalypse, these are schlock films.  That doesn't mean they aren't great, because they are, but perhaps they are best viewed in circumstances and formats that are less than stellar.  I think of these films as zooted up B-Movies, sort of the way John Carpenter was making some of his films in the late 70's and early 80's.  Or maybe even Spaghetti Westerns such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.  When I bought my special editions of those great Clint Eastwood Spaghetti Westerns, I found that they had added footage I didn't give a damn about, disrupting the flow of the film, and additional new and improved sound effects.  I don't want new sound effects!  I want the old sound effects.  The ones that sound terrible and completely unreal with all their echoing and ricocheting sounds.  That is what makes them what they are-- superbly unpolished, and vintage.  I would actually hate to see them do this with the Mad Max series, though I think it may be inevitable now that I see a 4th film is in the works.
Perhaps, someday, Warner Bros. will get it right and release a decent box set collection for these films, complete with bonus features galore.  Until that time, this set will do.  Remember, after all, it is cheap.  You pay for what you get.  And that ain't bad.
