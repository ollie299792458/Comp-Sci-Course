I just watched this film this morning -- nearly a dozen years after the film's release.  I wish I had actually never seen it.

What a stupid story!  The entire premise is so preposterous that I imagine this film can only be enjoyed if you have the ability to suspend all critical thinking while viewing it.  As others have commented, it makes absolutely no sense that this random accountant would be enlisted at the last minute to assassinate a governor, especially given the apparently large network of conspirators involved.  Why Johnny Depp's character wouldn't have screamed for help as soon as he and his daughter were being abducted is beyond me.  (Are we really to believe that he assumed that the "police" had a legitimate reason for detaining him and his daughter the way they did?)  Later while he's pointing the gun at the head of the woman watching his child and she effectively talks him out of pulling the trigger by scaring him that the gunfire would "go through the seat" or be "deflected by a button" and hurt his girl, I could not believe how stupid his character apparently was.  A quick shot in the woman's head from the angle at which he was holding the gun would certainly not go through the seat or deflect off a button, and the woman would certainly be dead and he could have taken his daughter and fled.  And on and on with the ridiculous scenarios.

By far the worst film I've seen Johnny Depp in.  The director even managed to mitigate Depp's sex appeal by making his character plain looking and apparently moronic beyond words.
