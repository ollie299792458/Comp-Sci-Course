I some how managed to find this gem at a West Coast Video store in Princeton, Nj when i was there for film camp. I watched this movie a total of 6 times during the 3 weeks i had the movie. ( i never did return it) I must say that i was amazed at how wonderfully this movie was shot (that coming from a filmmakers point of veiw) but besides that i think that passolini's choice to stay as true to the book its based on as possibal was definitly a good one. The total lack of character development through the whole movie gives you no time to feel for the chracters and when its all over your left with no feeling something like the chracters that the libertarians who capture the "sex Slaves". The end of the movie is so abrubt you never get the chance to understand if it is really over. You are going to need two things specially to make it through this movie. 1 is an open mind and 2 is a twisted perseption other wise id not show this one at a family game night. I recommend that you read the book before jsut for comparison but without it you can still enjoy the movie. So please find this movie and look at it and give it a chance youll either love it or protest its creation.
