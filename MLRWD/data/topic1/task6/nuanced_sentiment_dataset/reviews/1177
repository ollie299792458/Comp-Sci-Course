The Legend of Chun Li manages to be both a by-the-numbers video game movie and a by-the-numbers action movie.

It more-or-less ignores the back story of the popular video game franchise.  The characters have familiar names but don't wear their trademark costumes.  M. Bison is changed from a criminal warlord into a crooked property developer whose master plan is to drive up the crime rate and buy land cheap.  Chun Li shuns her trademark China dress for tank tops and sweat pants.

The Hollywood cliches include an ancient master, a training montage and lots of wire-fu.  For a film set in Southeast Asia the cast lacks Asian faces.  Along with Amer-Asian Kristins Kreuk and Moon Bloodgood most of the named heroes and villains are white.

The deleted scenes go some way towards fleshing out the characters and filling in the plot holes but it's hardly a good sign when the director chooses to cut out a good chunk of the plot.

It's not a bad film as Hollywood action goes, but there's really nothing to recommend it.
