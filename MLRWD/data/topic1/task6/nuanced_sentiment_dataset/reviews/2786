Urbania is the kind of film that, after watching it for the first time, you have to immediately see it again.  The second viewing is essential not only to convince yourself that what you have just experienced is real, but to take in all the minute details that you would never have noticed the first time.
Dan Futterman turns in a skilled and subtle performance as a lost and troubled New Yorker on a journey of guilt, anger, redemption and, at times, frightening apathy.  The script, editing and filmography are first rate.  These things, as well as an amazing supporting cast (including Josh Hamilton and Alan Cumming in tailor-made roles) come together to give us a disturbing, emotional and very sincere look into the darkest parts of human existence in the face of the thing we call fate.
While the film is very dark, showing us a seedy side to life, it balances it's central heavy themes with light moments and even comedy that are integrated seamlessly into it's overall atmosphere.  The best and worst that life has to offer are portrayed as being symbiotic.  Even when we are happiest there is still strife, and life can turn on a dime.  This film is about what we do, how we react, when life takes these sharp left turns.
A beautiful and haunting story of paradise destroyed and peace obtained from the rubble, Urbania is a must see for anyone who dares to live and love.
