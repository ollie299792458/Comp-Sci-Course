The 1962 "Mutiny on the Bounty" remains a strikingly good film. The script may not be historically accurate, but it packs a powerful dramatic punch. The build-up in tension between Brando's Fletcher Christian and Trevor Howard's Captain Bligh is superbly sustained until it explodes in the mutiny itself. There are many wonderfully crafted scenes - the crew being met at Tahiti, Bligh's hints to Christian that he should woo the king's daughter, (and Christian's pretended bewilderment), the Tahitian dancing (and Bligh's clumsy attempt to join in) and Christian's romance with Maimiti, to say nothing of the adrenalin-rush when Fletcher Christian finally snaps. The star-studded cast never fails to deliver, and the wonderful scenery of Tahiti and Pitcairn Island takes us into a world we may never have seen quite like this. The music has a big cinematic sound that still works. "The Bounty" was specially constructed - a complete, full-size replica. Lewis Milestone, famous for many great films going back to "All Quiet on the Western Front" (in 1930!) directed this film, which received a swag of academy award nominations - but no oscars (what a year - it was up against "Lawrence of Arabia", "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "The Longest Day"). This DVD includes extras which are of some interest, including scenes originally (and rightly) excluded from the film showing the finding of the Pitcairn Islanders many years later.  A great film.
