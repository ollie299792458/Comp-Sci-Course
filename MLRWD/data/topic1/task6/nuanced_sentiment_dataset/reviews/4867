Two months ago a friend gave my son Meet the Letters.  He was 18 months old.  He immediately took to this DVD and wanted to watch it all of the time.  Within 3 weeks he knew all of the upper-case and lower-case letters.  My wife and I couldn't believe it.  He was 18 months old and while his friends were obsessed with trains and cars, he became obsessed with letters.  He now points at letters everywhere we go and reads the letters in books and on signs.  We just bought all of the other DVDs in the Series (Meet the Numbers, Meet the Shapes and Meet the Colors and are expecting great results).  I will report on those once we get them.  I also bought him the Meet the Letters Lift the Flap book and he sits with it every time that he watches the DVD.  He always makes sure that he is on the right page that matches the letter on the TV.  I have told everyone I know about this amazing video.  I didn't think it was possible for my son to learn letters at this early age but it was so easy for him.  I bought Meet the Letters for two of the children in our play group and they have both had similar results (one learned in two weeks and the other in 3).  My son is on his way to literacy!
