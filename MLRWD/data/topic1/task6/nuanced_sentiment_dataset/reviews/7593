This movie is totally overrated to me. Not worth watching more than once. Not even Oscar worthy. The only reason why this movie was a big deal and the reason why Halle Barry won an Oscar is because of the explicit sex scene between Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton.

I have to say I am really dissapointed in Halle Berry for doing that unnecessary sex scene. They did not have to go that far to get the point across. I haven't respected her the same since. Most women starting out in their acting careers do scenes like that to get ahead. Halle Berry was already well established and respected. She didn't need to do that kind of a scene.

Besides that one scene, the reason I didn't really care for this movie is because I felt that the characters were not well established. I did not feel a connection with them. Also I thought Halle Berry's acting was not that great or believable. I felt she overacted. There were only two characters in the movie that interested me and that was the husband on death row played by Sean Combs and the neighbor with the boys played by Mos Def. They were interesting enough to me where I wanted to know more about their characters.
