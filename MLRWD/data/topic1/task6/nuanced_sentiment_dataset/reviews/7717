The story is about a man named Reuben Feffer, who works in the Insurance business, who just got married to a woman named Lisa. When they go on their honeymoon, she cheats on him with Scuba instructor (i guess that's what he is). He goes back and runs into an old friend Polly Prince, who lives an extremely different life then him but he feels that the relationship, with himself and Polly would work.

This movie only good because of its supporting cast, i am not a big fan of Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston in this film, because it is a weak story between the two of them. It also feels like Ben Stiller is playing an alternate version of his character Greg Focker in Meet The Parents, which weakens his character. Philip Seymour Hoffman is hilarious in this film, the basketball games, his wild antics just make his character the real star of the film. Alec Baldwin is also a minor role that is also great, the bathroom scene with him and Ben is extremely funny. Last but not least, Bryan Brown, who has one great scene after another, i loved him jumping off the building, that was classic. There really isn't much after that because the script is very weak on plot, and on original story.

Overall a 3 out 5, the reason why i gave it a 7 is because the comedy from the actors i mentioned above, made this movie extremely funny and even though it does have its flaws, the comedy those actors bring make worth while.

As far as DVD extras are concerned, they are extremely good. There is a blooper reel, Commentary for the whole movie, and a short making of the movie. The extras are very good, i give the extras a 4 out 5. I love the Commentary, i think Commentary makes even the worst movie look good, because it is always interesting to hear how certain scenes are made and other unknown things that people might not know.
