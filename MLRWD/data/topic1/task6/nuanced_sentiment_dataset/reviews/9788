I'm A BIG De Niro fan. I respect a lot of his movies. But this is the worst movie I have ever seen him in, by far the worst! The characters are boring there is nothing fun or memorable to get you interested in the characters themselves, or there lives for that matter. The story is all over the place. It was suppose to poke fun or the industry but can I get a laugh in the process. It was a real let down for a man of his talents. I can't imagine him looking over the script and thinking this was a good idea. I've never even heard of this movie and I see why. If I were able to give it a lower score I would. It doesn't have a single moment when you can say(honestly) to someone I atleast got 1 good laugh out of it, not one! This movie is so awful that I had to take a breaks because I couldn't stand to watch it for a long period time. It was that bad in my opinion. It took me 3 days to watch the whole thing. I was looking for 1 silver cloud in the other wise cesspool of a hurricane you would call a movie, also I try to finsh every move I watch so I can be fair. Don't waste your time, or money wait until it comes out on T.V. for FREE. Even then you should still get a refund.
