I was looking for the version that they used to play on family classics with Frazer Thomas and Roy Lenard. I remember when I was a kid they used to play this specific version before they started playing this other you'd see on WGN channel 9. anyway like I said in the title that it wasn't bad. I liked it. I would have given it 4 stars but it wasn't the version I was looking for.  If you enjoy the classic story of A Christmas Carol in black and white, I think you will enjoy this one too.

For those of you interested there were to version that family classics played. the earlier version they used to play is the one I was looking for whiched starred Reginald Owens  and Gene Lockhart. I found it here and ordered it through amazon. thought I have not watched it yet because I am waiting to watch it christmas eve night (traditional thing).

Oh and from looking at the pictures on the case it looks as if it has been done over in color. though I was looking forward to the old black and white look of it. its something about watching it in black and white that gives it that old fashion christmas feeling. It's like watching "It's a wonderful life" in black and white. you just have to apeciate the classics, I guess.
