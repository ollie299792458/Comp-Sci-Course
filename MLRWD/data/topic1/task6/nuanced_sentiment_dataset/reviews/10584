This is simply a marvelous film; a classic in every sense of the word!  Up until now, the only version of this available on DVD was part of the 3-disc set "Early Masterworks Of The German Horror Cinema".  That version was a bit disappointing for two reasons: first there was no music soundtrack, and the other was the grainy quality of the print used.  
The quality of this DVD is immaculate; the accompanying music score is excellent, and it's very obvious from the opening shot that this company went to great lengths (and expense) to restore this film.  The only minor problem is the color tinting that was utilized to enhance each scene; in some instances, the tinting is somewhat overpowering and nearly washes out some of the scenery (especially when the red tinting is present).  Otherwise, this is as pristine a print and restoration that you will ever see in any form; an excellent job all around!
As many have pointed out, this film was perceived as the basis for "Frankenstein", although a silent version of Frankenstein appeared prior in 1910, and is very rare on video.  Paul Wegener is outstanding as the title character Golem, and Greta Schroeder puts in a brief appearance here two years prior to her more memorable performance in the classic "Nosferatu".  
I highly recommend this DVD!
