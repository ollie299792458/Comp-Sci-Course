I became a huge fan of Pixar and their short films after seeing "Luxo, Jr." in a film festival in the 1980's. Each successive effort broke new ground and gave us hints of the wonderful full-length features to come.

So, why the 1 star? I am hopping mad at the censors at Disney. One of my favorite pieces, "Knick Knack" was edited (or remastered by Pixar, presumably at Disney's request) to make two of the female characters flat-chested. Sheesh! The protagonist in this short is a licentious, over-confident, and determined snowman trapped in his snow globe knick knack. He is surrounded by a number of other tacky souvenirs but one in particular, featuring a (very) buxom beauty in a skimpy bikini, sends him on his adventure to escape his hemispherical world. The object of his affection, with her very curvy shape, helps provide a key insight into our character. Not any more! The new "child-friendly"/"politically correct" flat-topped lady has replaced her.

What is the problem, Disney? Too edgy?

Pixar makes great films with likable, believable characters with depth and a personality. Knick Knack was a clever short film; now it is just a Disney cartoon.

Unless you like bland second-best, and versions of Star Wars where Han doesn't shoot first, give this a skip.
