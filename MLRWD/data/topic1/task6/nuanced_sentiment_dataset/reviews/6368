This is a movie you want to see again and again, and each time you get something new from it.  Although it's set in the future, the focus is on themes like human nature and morality questions, rather than what you'd  expect from a flick in the 'sci-fi' genre, and these themes are explored  with originality and insight.  I was not bored in the least, although my  roommate (who was watching it for a film studies class) fell asleep. Lots  of humor, especially one really great chase scene.  This film is  intriguing because the characters are not black-and-white: the bank robbers  are nice guys, good intentions end up being destructive, etc., and the film  leaves you pondering the fuzzy line between right and wrong.  One of the  main plotlines is a pursuit, or rather multiple pursuits (a man chasing a  woman chasing a man being chased), but you come to sympathize with all the  characters;  you could debate forever who the 'good guys' and 'bad  guys'are.  At the same time, it's really enjoyable to watch: you don't  have to get bogged down in the deeper meanings of you don't want to, just  be entertained by the story.  All in all, it's an amazing film, timeless  (it's especially apt as we enter the new century, but it has a wonderful  classic feel), poignant, humorous, thought- and discussion-provoking...  it's just a great film!
