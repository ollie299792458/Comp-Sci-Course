i dunno. listening to this you'd think Disney history started with Eisner and Katzenberg. for some of us that's where it's true artistic focus became strictly commercial and the heart was suffocated out of the whole thing and sold off to corporate mentality.
  if you think Disney is all about the business side of the man's sucess then you are very wrong and have lost the spirit of this. Walt's true sucess was in something more than just money and pleasing banks. most of the reviewers here seem not to really get this. i thought this movie was about the late 50's and the making of the original feature, not about waxing and perpetrating the overratted reign of Eisner and Katzenberg. who by the by were no Disney.
  no wonder so many neo-Disney fans are so mixed up and aren't sure what to think. it all started with a mouse dummies. not with the Disney channel or Eisner. and the studio began on Hyperion and then in Burbank not Florida.
  the animation division in the late seventies and eighties were turning out some excellent films. only nobody was appreciating them properly. success and artistic sucess is hardly ever judged on money on mass appeal of the current time. unless you are a shallow boob.
