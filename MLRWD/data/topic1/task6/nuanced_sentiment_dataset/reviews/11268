i have seen several Fulci movies and have been shocked by something in each one.  In "The New York Ripper," i was somewhat disappointed.  Part of it, i think, is that i saw it took place in New York City, and was expecting New York actors and well written English dialogue, instead of the poor dubbing that is associated with his movies.  That was probably my fault for expecting that from an Italian director.  However, that aside, i found the murder and gore to be sub-par compared to the things i've seen in "Zombie," "City of the Living Dead," and even the apparently horribly butchered version of "The Beyond" i own entitled "Seven Doors of Death."  With this movie, what i was really hoping to find was a gritty, more reality-based Fulci movie with the same brutal viciousness and gore offered by his other more supernatural-themed movies.  However, what it lacked in gore it more than made up for with blatant misogyny, which was ever-present and strong throughout this movie, ensuring to stroke the woman-hater in all of us. (What, "there's no woman-hater in [you]," you say?  Right, and michael jackson only had two nose jobs.)  i guess Fulci was trying to focus more on sexual excess and perversion that can sometimes be a prominent aspect of human nature,  than on the excessive gore that typified his movies in this one, but it just didn't really seem to work very well.  
Overall, the characters are as shallow as in any of his movies, the plot is somewhat hackneyed, and the gore is not nearly what i had come to expect from a Lucio Fulci movie.  However, it did have its moments, such as the razor blade bisecting the nipple, and is definitely worth the watch and probably the purchase too, especially for the Fulci fan, as well as any other disturbed individuals who enjoy gorging themselves on violence and the humiliation and degradation of other people, namely women (not that i condone that sort of thing.)
