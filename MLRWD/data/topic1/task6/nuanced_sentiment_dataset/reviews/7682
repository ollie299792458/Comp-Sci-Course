A line from Henry Fonda (as Frank) right before he eliminates a kid, never did Henry Fonda play a more ruthless character than in Sergio Leone's classic epic western, Once Upon a Time in the West, featuring an all-star cast with Charles Bronson, Jason Robards, the luscious Claudia Cardinale, genre actor Frank Wolff, character actor Jack Elam, and Woody Strode. The opening scene alone is classic with no dialogue for the first ten minutes into the film, there was a story the legendary director Sergio Leone once considered Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef for the opening scene roles, of course they would be eliminated after the first scene, can you imagine these three desperados up against Charles Bronson, it makes you think, who would've won this battle, who knows, never happened. If you've never seen this Spaghetti western, it is a glorious spectacle to be seen, the greatest western ever made?, definitely in the top twenty, let's not forget about Peckinpah's, The Wild Bunch. This special two disc edition is presented in 16x9 widescreen at a cheap reasonable price.
