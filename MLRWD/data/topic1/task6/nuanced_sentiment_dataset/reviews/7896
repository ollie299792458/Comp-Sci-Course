Okay, I'm sure that the plot of the movie is already up in this page, so I'll skip that and get right to the point.
First off, this movie is a mix of the two Anne Rice books: The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the Damned. 
The first half an hour was boring as hell. Sure, it had good moments here and there,  but it just didn't seem to go anywhere.  And then when Akasha, the title character, FINALLY appeared, it started looking good....for about five minutes.  It seemed like the film makers were struggling to make it look good, which is a real shame because they have so much potential with this.  But the movie just seemed to drag.  And then, when there was action, it was just thrown away.  It was too short. The only good thing was the music.  
Another beef with this movie was the SCARCITY OF THE TITLE CHARACTER!! WHAT IS UP WITH THAT???She was probably in about 15 minutes total of the movie.  And I know for a fact that Aaliyah was alive for the whole run of the film, rest her sole. That is why this review has 2 stars instead of 1. Aaliyah's acting was really good.  It is a real shame.  
My last beef with this movie is that you really don't know who to root for. Essentially, there is no good guy.  Even the supposed good guys are still blood sucking demons.  
All in all, this movie was a real let down.  I'm sure vamp fans and goths will love this flick, but it was too disappointing for me, and I love vampires.
