Robert Rodriguez is an enormously talented director, but I'm still wondering why on Earth he wanted to make this stupid teen horror film about aliens taking over a high school.
He probably thought that he could make  it better with his own personal style and, while I commend him for trying,  this movie is a half an inch from being completely  unwatchable.
Rodriguez's directing, usually so involved and in-yer-face  in his previous films, seems pedestrian in this movie. It's almost as if he  knew how bad the material that he was working with was.
The lousy and  unoriginal special effects speak for themselves: they are laughable and  embarrassing to watch. Not only did this movie lack creativity, but it also  lacked originality.
The only plus that I can give this movie is that,  unlike other teen movies, the actors that portray teenagers in this movie  actually seem like real teenagers.
I can't even recommend the film on  that basis. Avoid this movie and see Rodriguez's "El Mariachi"  which, for a film with a not-so-new story idea, was a fresh and innovative  movie that offered something new.
