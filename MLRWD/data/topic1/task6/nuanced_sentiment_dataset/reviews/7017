How could anyone write a bad review about "Just Like Heaven"? It's divine! It's a beautiful blend of humor, tragedy, sadness, romance, and happiness. Although the humorous scenes were clever and witty and fun to watch, the sad scenes haunted me long after the movie had ended... like when David reveals to Elizabeth that his wife died so suddenly that there was no time to say good-bye... when Abby tells David that she has decided to terminate Elizabeth's life support because those were her final wishes, and she wants to respect them... when Elizabeth has resigned herself to her fate and sadly tells David that she spent all her life "working, working, working" and didn't live a full life.

The musical score was beautiful and really enhanced the movie.

Reese Witherspoon's acting was excellent. She has an amazing assortment of facial expressions that always perfectly convey the emotion of the moment: joy, when she (as Elizabeth) hears the news of her promotion; indignation, when she confronts David in the apartment for the first time, thinking he's a squatter; sympathy, when she hears about his wife's sudden death; sadness, when she looks back on her life of constant work and no play; conniving, when she helps David concoct a story for the doctor who has come to disconnect her life support. Etc!
