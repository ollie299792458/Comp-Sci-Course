Luc Besson is the writer and producer of "Paris With Love",
but his influence on the director is really apparent.

At his best, Besson's films are ravishingly well-shot and
edited with humor and kinetic energy.

At his worst, his films are boring and repetitive, taking
one idea and playing it out tiresomely to build  a feature
length film.

"La Femme Nikita" is one of the better ones.  "The Fifth
Element" is lots of fun and very imaginative.

I found "the Big Blue" virtually unwatchable.  The Joan
of Arc movie was overlong by about an hour and suffered
from a bizarre tonality, even with it's dazzling sets and
costumes.

Travolta has a few opportunities to be fun to watch,  but the
film is sadistic and gratuitously violent.  Travolta's character
kills off about 30 people, both innocent folks and terrorists
and doesn't get a scratch.

This film owes a lot to John Woo style actioners. The film-making
is competent but the story and script are just dumb.
