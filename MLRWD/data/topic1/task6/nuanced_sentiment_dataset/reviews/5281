All I can say about this movie is about its format. Its a good movie in my opinion so enough said there. What I like is Motion Picture Companies know there are a wide group of people out there that preferr Full Screen to Wide Screen. Wide Screen is only good if you can afford Wide Screen TV's, Amazon.ca also seem to know this and they make it available both ways. Stores in my area like to let on some movies did not come out in Full Screen. Thats when I produce my copy and shoe them they are full of it. Hats off to the part of the industry that wants to sell their product to everyone. To the Companies that are to cheap to make copies of the film in both formats, its your fincial loss, cause Myself I try to avoid buying movies that will only come in wide screen.
I do have one question though concerning Blue ray. I recently purchase a DVD, HD-DVD and Blue ray combo player. I'm beginning to think it was a waste of money, because I refuse to waste my money in Blue ray movies if they are all a wide screen format. Has anyone been able to find a Blue ray movie in Full Screen that wasn't made ages ago. Got off the topic some did't I.
