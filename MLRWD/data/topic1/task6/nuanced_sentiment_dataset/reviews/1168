I loved this movie. It is not just about war but about humanity and what people go through for freedom and what they give up for their country. This is very patriotic but also gives us a history lesson of the hardships during a time when blacks who were merely slaves back then. 
Denzel was superub and should have won best actor for his awesome and fierce performance. He is a slave who has been through hell and is very angry about how he has been treated and often takes it out on his fellows.
Morgan Freemen also did an excellent job- who was the father of the group. 
Matthew Broderick far from his other movies. He takes a serious role and does a great job convincing us as he is a General. Very sensitive to the needs of people. It was very heartfelt.
Please please please but this movie. You will find yourself crying, laughing, smiling, and angry over what I would call the greatest movie that I have seen in such a long time.
The DVD has deleted scenes. Also the second DVD is another version of the movie on Widescreen. So you can choose how you want to watch. Nothing very special about that. However, I think it is a worthy movie.
