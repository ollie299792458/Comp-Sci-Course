We just bought the new Sony Playstation3, which comes with integrated Blu-ray disc player.  I wanted to try out the Blu-ray, and bought this movie for that purpose (my son really likes Will Ferrell).

While the movie is typically Will Ferrell (funny if you like him, stupid if you don't like him), I don't feel this movie was a good vehicle for showcasing the Blu-ray technology.  Our new TV is a 60-inch Sony SXRD, capable of displaying full HD (up to 1080p).  Yet the picture on this film did not seem any better than a normal DVD picture.  In my opinion, much HD television programming available today is superior to the image quality of this particular Blu-ray disc.

Bottom line, if you have a standard DVD player already, save yourself a few bucks and buy the standard DVD version of this film rather than the Blu-ray version.  I'm sure there will be Blu-ray discs that will knock my socks off, but this one just seemed like they took normal DVD-quality video and threw it onto a Blu-ray disc.
