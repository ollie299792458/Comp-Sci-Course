There are people who will dismiss this is just a god-awful film abomination but, I assure you, you're missing the point if you can't find the value in this movie. It's bad on purpose, made so by the greatest B-movie company this generation, The Asylum. Mockbusters are not hit-and-miss, they are straight up "aim for the kid in the crowd and not a home run." If you're looking for the actual Thor (which, in my opinion is actually worse than this movie), then you're in the wrong place. Learn to google and search for the appropriate titles - or don't and end up with this and you'll have learned a lesson. The Asylum movies are perfect for getting drunk and watching with friends. Death Race? Pathetic. Death Racers 2000? Hilarious. The same thing applies to this movie where you've got a young varsity bro playing the least battle-ready Thor ever trying to keep a fake Styrofoam hammer from an aging Richard Greico, who spends the majority of the movie pacing up and down the same Los Angeles alley. Do you miss being able to see how badly a movie is green-screened? Well, look no further than Almighty Thor or, as I like to call it, "Let's Play Pretend."

"This is just a wall."
"No, it's not. It's a portal."
"Whoa, it is!"
