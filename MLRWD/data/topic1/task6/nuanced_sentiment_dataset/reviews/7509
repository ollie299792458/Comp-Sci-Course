I truly, truly wish that I were around to see this movie when it first came out.
When it came out in the 1970's, much of the subject matter was taboo.  Unfortunately, when I saw the movie with a few friends of mine, we weren't scared at all.  The possessed scenes of poor Linda Blair cursing and making lewd comments that made people cringe back then do nothing now.  Society has changed so that nowadays, we hear that kind of language all the time, so a lot of the impact is lost.  So, throughtout the movie, I kept in mind that back then, this kind of thing was very rare to witness, and it helped a little.
Some parts DID make us jump, though, so it hasn't lost ALL of it's appeal.  Linda Blair does a wonderful job playing the poor girl that degrades from a innocent girl to the Devil himself, and the special effects are the best thing next to computer animation, so I give it four stars because it has good special effects, good acting...and hey, it's a classic!  So go on and try it out.  After all, some adults from the 1970's STILL haven't watched it!  In fact, once The Exorcist is re-released into theaters this fall, I'm going to drag my mom down to watch it for the first time!
