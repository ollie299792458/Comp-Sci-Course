Spoilers

Storyline (3 Stars)

Doesn't this seem familar to anyone else?  I've seen/read a lot of things generally pertaining to this very type of incident.  But, still, I think it was well executed by the director and actors to make this better than what I've seen pertaining to this sort of phenomenon.

Acting (4 Stars)

I love Kate Beckinsale, and I think Adam Sandler's roles as moderately serious, moderately silly are working much better than his full-on seriousness.  I loved him when he was goofy, in roles like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore.  But, I can't deny that he did some pretty excellent acting, especially at the end, of this movie.

Overall (3 Stars) - The Spoiler at the End

I liked this movie.  I'd recommend you go see it.  But don't expect Spanglish Adam or Billy Adam.  Because you won't get that.  I, personally, think you will enjoy the mixture of the two as they are mostly harmonious in this film.  But, I am just glad it didn't end the way I thought it would.  Go see this film!  It's really not all taht funny, it's just a generally good plot.
