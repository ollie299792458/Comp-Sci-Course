Coming from someone who spent their college years in a southern, mostly black, marching band on the drum line I can say that this movie is atleast accurate enough to come across well. This movie isn't a documentary, it's Hollywood, hence the exaggerations on some aspects of the story. Also the movie focuses mostly on the drummers themselves while the rest of the band kind of takes a back seat. While being in a band like this does require serious commitment and hard work to pull these types of field shows off, it's not exactly as "boot camp" like as the movie tries to portray. Although i'm just speaking from personal experience with my school. Also, it may be difficult for someone who is more used to the corps style of marching to understand what's going on with band like this, but just open yourself up to learn something new and you may enjoy it. As for the movie itself, it's nothing to write home about. The best reason to watch this movie is just to see the performances of some of these bands. The only thing that I wish this movie had was a bit more focus outside of the drumlines. Although it's the name of the movie, still there's more to these bands than their drummers.
