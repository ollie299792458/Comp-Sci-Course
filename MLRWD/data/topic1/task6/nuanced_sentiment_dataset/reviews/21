I was a little bit disapointed when I watched the movie alot of the characters on the movie should have been replaced with new cast members.  I felt the roll of Boss Hogg was wrong and Burt Reynolds shouldn't have been there at all.  Another charactors who played Bo and Duke were good for the part but they didn't fit the profile the pair looked out of place, they should have been in the city rather in a small country place.
The ones who suited the movie were Jesse (Willie Nelson) he fitted the build and the charactor of Uncle Jesse it was watching the Uncle Jesse from the TV show.
Daisy Duke (jessica Simpson) played it well but the Directors needed to try and stop getting her to walk around in her bikini or the cameras should stop panning down to her legs.  Other actors who played the characters of  the sherriff, Enos, Couter, were spot on.
But the down side was that I agreed with the one who played the orginal Bo Duke (John Schinder)(Excuss spelling.) He told one reporter in New Zealand (My home country) that the movie lacked family values (I think it was in those words) and I agree.
