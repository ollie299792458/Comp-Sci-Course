The movie is classic, should one purchase this movie to view it for the first time or revist, go for an earlier print or find the earlier box set which contained photos and facsimile of Hepburn's shooting script; if one is buying this Anniversary edition because of the "extras" save your money and see above.

The "So Audrey" is so dreary. Instead of seeing costume tests for the movie or background for designs for Miss Hepburn we get a parade of movie clips from Tiffany's and other Audrey Hepburn movies from the studio. It would have been interesting to have some background on the design for the movie and the famous "feud" of Edith Head signing sketches of Givency's creations (i.e. the "Little Black Dress") Then there is the commentary by the producer who naters on and on about such things as the use of the typewriter in the movie is so dated and the fact that upon seeing a closeup of Buddy Epson "How blue his eyes are" and the tiresome "in hindsight" he wouldn't have cast Mickey Rooney in the comic role of the Japanese Photographer. Wouldn't it have been more interesting to hear Blake Edward's take on it?  And, in fact Blake Edwards Commentary itself? Why Hepburn took the role, how she prepared.  The viewer gets no inside knowledge as to why the movie became a classic in the first place. All we get is "Now we are in New York; Now, this shoot is in Hollywood". By the way, wouldn't you think by now someone connected with this movie would know that the shots of "Holly's" apartment building is on East 71st and not West 74th. There is no excuse for this repackaging. Movie B+; Extras F-
