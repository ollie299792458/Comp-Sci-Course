House On Haunted Hill (HOHH) has been available for some time on a variety of DVD releases, including one budget release that was paired with another Vincent Price film, Last Man On Earth. While that budget release contained a widescreen version of HOHH, this new release from Legend Films does not. However, that is my only complaint about this disc. The quality of the print is quite good and the optional commentary track by Mike Nelson (former head writer and performer on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K), available on Rhino DVD) is hilarious. While not as engaging as the full MST3K treatment, there are no host segments, sketches or buddies with whom to interact, Mr. Nelson's humor is sharp, entertaining and enjoyable.

House On Haunted Hill by itself is a fun film that is entertaining on repeated viewings. It is just so silly and full of campy "scares," yet it has a surprisingly good cast delivering solid performances in spite of the film's premise. The addition of Mike Nelson's commentary and the option of watching the film colorized will add to the repeat viewing value.

One really nice extra feature on this disc is that you can hear the funny commentary track while watching the original black and white version of the film as well as the colorized version; a nice treat for those film buffs and purists who dislike colorization. I hope Legend Films will include this option on future releases; I missed it on their Three Stooges release where one could only see the Film Crew host segments on the colorized track.

Whether you are a fan of old thrillers, an MST3K fan, or just a comedy fan who enjoys funny commentary, this disc should provide a lot of entertainment for a fairly modest price. Recommended.
