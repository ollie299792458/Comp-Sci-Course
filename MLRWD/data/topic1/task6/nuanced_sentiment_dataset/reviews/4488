Having watched this DVD for one of my college classes, it really was quite confusing, especially when compared to modern, episodic TV (Friends, Law &amp; Order, etc.).
Once Upon a Time - This episode didn't have the bubble, but not being aware of what "absolute zero" was made the show hard to follow.  When Number 2 abandons his method to find out why Number 6 resigned, he starts to develop a friendship of sorts, not realizing that Number 6 is really in charge.  Number 2 dies and Number 6 wants to meet Number 1.
Fall Out - This is probably the most bizarre episode of them all. With the trial of Number 48 and Number 2, the robed representatives have very strange reactions, maybe the proceedings annoying. When Number 2 gives his speech, they repeat "I" over and over again, making it impossible to understand him.  I do like the way this one ends, it is silly, but it makes sense.  We are all prisoners to society.
Because of the class that I was in, we only watched "Arrival," "Once Upon a Time," and "Fall Out."  Perhaps my opinion would have been different.
