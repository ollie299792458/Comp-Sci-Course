Loved the book. The movie was a wonderful representation of the book.

I, too, agree that all the "change-ups" on the special feature offerings among the different DVDs is frustrating and unfortunate.

On my DVD about the only special feature available is the "Commentary" so I finally decided to watch the movie with the commentary on - BIG MISTAKE. The commentary is totally lame and insulting.  Just seems to be an endless run-on of inside personal jokes. I would have liked to hear more about how the filming was done, how the scenes were chosen, what is said and not said. Not very much of that. Just little half-jokes that they laugh at, never really telling the whole story.

One of the reasons I wanted to run the commentary was to see what they had to say about a fascinating thing that was caught on film during the Bella-Jake werewolf "reveal" discussion on the beach.  Way out on the horizon, right between the two actor framed up... a whale breaches in the water. Weren't these guys studying every frame of this film? Did they completely miss this???

Don't expect too much from the "Commentary".
