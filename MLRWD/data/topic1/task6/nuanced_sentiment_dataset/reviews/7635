This movie is very complex and non-linear.  The viewer has to pay close attention to what is going on.  But one shouldn't panic at the first sign of confusion.  Hang on and challenge yourself to last through the movie.  You may not feel satisfied by the movie, but you will think about it.  Whether you end up liking the movie or not, it will effect you.  That makes it the great movie that it is.  I'm not sure whether I like it or not, but I'm glad I watched it.  And I think about it and I'm still confused by some aspects of it.  It needs a few views to be understood.  But I'm not straining too hard to understand everything, because being confused and disoriented while watching a movie is a good thing.  I don't really care if I don't know what's going on all the time.  It makes for a very unpredictable experience.  Too many movies today are so predictable, this one is not.  The crude sexual scenes add to the reality of the movie.  This is a REAL sci-fi movie.  What I mean by REAL, is that the movie is about an alien and outerspace.  But one wouldn't really know it until about half way through the movie.  The true nature of the picture is hidden behind a well written movie about human life.  Then when the sci-fi aspect unfolds, it has a great impact.  I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a challenge.
