Although this movie brought back fond memories of my days in Japan after WWII (I had 3 assignments there with the ARC & Army Special Services), of their wonderfully interesting culture and the people, this movie left a bad taste in my mouth.  I do wish the Hays Office was still operating.  They never would have allowed the language heard in nearly every scene, nor the scenes suggesting fornication, which is much too prevalent in today's shows.  When will Hollywood learn that in order to be popular, the movie's characters don't have to cuss & swear and glamorize other wickedness noted above?  There is entirely too much taking the Lord's name in vain in this movie.  I'm sorry I bought it.  It is not a movie for impressionable children.

I'm a baseball nut, and have all of the "Major League" movies which are funny and very well done, but as I said, I'm disappointed in "Mr. Baseball".  My advice would be to save your money.  There are better love stories and baseball movies out there.  For instance, "Pride of the Yankees" - the true story of Lou Gehrig, with Gary Cooper as Lou - is amazingly good, riviting you to your seat!  One of my favorites.
