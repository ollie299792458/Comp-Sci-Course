The movie APOLLO 13  and of course the real odyssey that took place in 1970 are more than just a near space tragedy and an aborted manned flight to the moon. They are about human determination, intelligence, cooperation and the fight for life in time of a very big crisis and challenge which in case of APOLLO 13 created a miracle. Returning safely back to Earth  was a miracle because after an oxygen tank exploded in the service module en route to the moon, the spacecraft was so crippled that, not only was the moon landing cancelled, but the astronauts in APOLLO 13 together with staff of Houston mission control had to think and act fast to solve many of the lethal problems that emerged in the spacecraft. The movie has historical value as well because it dramatizes excellently the APOLLO 13 adventure which certainly is a very important event in the history of manned space flights. I highly recommend everybody to watch this DVD, not just to people who are interested in manned space flights but also to people who want to see what miracles human determination and intelligence can achieve.
