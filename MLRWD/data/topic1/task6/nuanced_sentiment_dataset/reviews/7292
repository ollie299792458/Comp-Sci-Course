One of the few musicals to finally get the full DVD treatment and it certainly deserves it. Though the film is strictly a showcase of MGM talents, it manage to captures the styles, moods and elegance of Vincente Minelli in terms of sets decoration, production design and musical directions. Musical numbers ranges from popular standards to the world of opera. Stand outs are Fred Astaire and Lucille Bremmer musical numbers, especially 'This Heart of Mine' is simply beautiful and lush and 'Limehouse Blues' which is mesmerising, Judy Garland's 'Interview with A Lady' is delightful and witty, Lena Horne's 'Love' is haunting and seductive.

Remastering of the film is excellent and the colours are restored to its glory and it is magnificent and the sound remixed to Dolby Digital Stereo does justice to the film. The film hasn't any plots and there are so many gems to chose from as each segments is unique to the performer and it is a joy to behold.

A true musical tribute to the artists and production crew in the MGM musical reportoire.
