A Bridge Too Far was trashed when it opened in 1977 for reasons of length and appearing old-fashioned in a world that was about to be changed by Star Wars.  
Looking at this film now, you can see that ABTF isn't a bad film per se, but one that ought never to have been made. Why endure a three hour pummelling for a rout? If you watch this film and know little history, it looks as though the Allies lost WWII. 
Compared with a modern war film, say Blackhawk Down, which also concerns a battlefield disaster, you can see that ABTF is prissy almost, in its depiction of combat, and so obsessed with "STAR" quality that its distracting.  The producer needed Olivier, Redford, and the superfluous Liv Ullman to open this film, otherwise who would come to see it?  Still, no one did.
Really, this film has its values in 1950's film production. Richard Attenborough directs with competence, but without verve. Ridley Scott's BD is compelling, involving, and disturbing, much more so given the scope of the action and its consquences (small and not many). 
Worth seeing if you're a history freak.  Worth seeing if you like Anthony Hopkins playing somebody who would refrain from eating the brains out of a living skull.  Worth seeing if you like Hardy Kruger in an SS uniform. Worth seeing if you understand that Monty was a poor general and his precense in Allied command arguably delayed the defeat of Germany by six months. 
Side note: for an accurate account of the 101's involvement, see the Eindhoven segment of "Band of Brothers."  
Like most wars, A Bridge Too Far is a noble waste. What were they thinking?
