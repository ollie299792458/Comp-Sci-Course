Warner Bros. took forever to produce this DVD from their classic library, and by gum, it was worth the wait.  My copy arrived only last night and I've already watched the film, and about 1/3 of the voluminous bonus materials.  The print is the best you've ever seen of this glorious Technicolor effort.  As others have noted, there is some grain, especially in the early castle interior scenes, but once we're taken to the forest, the colors burst from the screen.
  There's so much here to rave about, but I'll highlight a few of my favorites.  Disc two is loaded, boasting a retrospective with commentators like Maltin, Behlmer, and Osborne. It is a terrific companion piece to the film and well worth the 35-minutes investment.  During that feature, make sure to pause the DVD to read the actual letter from Erich Wolfgang Korngold asking to be let off the project as musical composer.  Unfortunate affairs in his native Austria changed his mind, leading to one of the great scores in American cinema.  Nice touch that you can isolate that Oscar-winning score on the feature disc.  Don't miss the outtakes either... and the home movies shot by Rathbone and others during filming.
  My only regret is that the never-so-beautiful-as-she-is-here Olivia de Haviland was not interviewed.  At age 87, she seems as elegant and eloquent as ever, based on her appearance at this year's Academy Award telecast.  I'm sure her memories of Flynn in general and Robin Hood in particular would have made this an even more revealing look back at this magnificent film.
