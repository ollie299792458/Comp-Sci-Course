I saw Arbitrage today.  First let me confirm that Richard Gere's performance as troubled financier Robert Miller is outstanding, as the reviewers are commenting. Definitely Oscar nomination potential. Tim Roth and Susan Sarandon also turn in solid performances.  The plot is tight and the editing efficient. The nightly glamour of New York's boulevards and sky scrapers from the inside of Towncar limos are well filmed. I look at this movie as a cross between the great 'Wall Street' of 1987 and last year's 'Margin Call'.
The one problem I had with the story is the plausibility that a world famous billionaire and highly visible, upstanding member of the community that Miller is would routinely have amongst his acquaintences a raft of shady and disreputable people that he easily summons and are willing to assist him in the coverup of his crimes with no more compunction than ordering a pizza. Surely such a famous man, constantly in the eye of the media, would have long ago been discovered associating with such people and questions raised. And just as surely would his accomplices be wary of associating with his crimes because of his high profile. This stretches credulity. Nevertheless the movie is well done and highly recommended.
