I couldn't see this creepshow when it was first released. Being scared and sheltered in my early ears, i wasn't too fond of scary movies.

For some reason during my first pregnancy I couldn't get enough of scary movies and happened to catch this on cable. I was disgusted, shocked and oddly aroused at how creepy the stories became. I enjoyed myself immensely.

As an author of several romance suspense I realized that you could still entertain through horror and that the genres of comedy and horror could mix well, even if it was close to absurdity.

The only thing I did find disappointing was the audio. I had to turn up the volume in order to hear the actors voices - especially on the "father's day" story. It sounded as if everyone spoke in low tones and then the music would be too loud.

Other than that, I'd recommend this movie to others who have not explored the creepshow genre, which I feel is in a class by itself. I plan to get the sequels as well to add to my collection.
