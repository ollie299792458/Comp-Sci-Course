This is actually a little painful to watch.  The production feels exactly like "Thorn Birds" or "Shogun".  Sure the sets and costumes are all first-rate.  Sure the supporting cast know their lines and don't bump into the furniture.  But....hmmmmm.....
The TV feeling gets more obvious and annoying the longer you watch.  You just want somebody to grab the camera and DO SOMETHING!  ARRRGH!  And there's Peck, walking here & walking there.  Looking at this & that.  He's acting's first rate considering he's  acting for television {{groan}}.  Though Peck was such an introverted actor, it's interesting to see him saunter about with most of his face covered up.  Introverted actors generally need closeups to show their mental wheels turning.  It would've been better to have a director like Franklin J. Schaffner, or just ANYBODY besides this "Jaws the Revenge" turkey.  Arrrgh! If it weren't for Peck, the whole thing would have the cinematic consistency of bubblegum  & sandpaper.  But even he can't save this beige disaster.
