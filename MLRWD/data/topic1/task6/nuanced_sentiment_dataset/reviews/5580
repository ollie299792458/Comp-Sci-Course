I must say that I enjoyed the film for the most part. The look and feel of it was great. It had stupendous panorama shots of great locations, real and not real. I was very impressed. It was very graphic in its violence with blood often spurting out all over. Some parts with topless women dancing adds a certain bawdiness and realistic feel to the film.
The witch daughter played by Rose McGowan was very chilling. I thought she was outstanding. Stephan Lang as the villain was noteworthy as well. He was rather cliche, but pulled it off well. Computer generated special effects were first rate as well. On the downside was Conan, Jason Momoa, was good in looking the part and in the action scenes, but his acting was worse than Arnold's. Can't they find a muscle bound guy that can act too?  Rachel Nichols as Tamara, his love interest was okay. She just seemed mis-cast. She was too demure and then too vicious. She seemed like a good actress though. The most irritating part of the movie is its logic and poor story line. Overall it is typical in that an evil person wants to rule the world. It was just some scenes were just so foolish. If you can overlook that and enjoy some gory violence, naked women, and a little stupidity in the scenes it is a good movie. I would watch it again. It is just that it could have been a great movie.
