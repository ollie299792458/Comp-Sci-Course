Let me first say that I've always been a fan of Juaquin.  I adored him in "I Walk the Line."
Secondly, let me say that he had me fooled after the David Letterman show.  I seriously thought he was going down the same dark path as his brother River.
It hurt me to see him like that and my heart ached for him.
  Once this was revealed as a hoax, I was SO happy, but could not understand why he would sabotage his career like he did.  I just HAD to see the movie.
Now, I am sorry that I did. Let me begin by saying that I am not a prude.  And NOT ALOT offends me.  THIS IS OFFENSIVE!!!  If this is truly how he is in real life, I will never again take interest in his career or watch one of his movies.  The vulgar language, the disgusting sexual content, the drug use...I have to believe (sadly) that most of this is TRULY who he is.  Even HE is not THAT good of an actor.
GREAT WORK JUAQUIN AND CASEY!!!  Truly career sabotage!  Don't waste your money...the story isn't even good....and the ending is not satisfying (I kept hoping for something good to come out of all of the crap - it never did).  It just ends.
