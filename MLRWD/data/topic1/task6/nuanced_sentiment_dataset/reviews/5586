I admit that I was not properly prepared when I first watched "The Mirror" (or "Mirror" or "The Looking Glass" or whatever it's really supposed to be called.)  It was not my first Tarkovsky movie, but I found it disjointed, confusing, incohesive, etc.  I even thought of turning it off in the middle and giving up on it.  But as I thought about it the next day, the meanings and symbols slowly became clear.  What was confusion and exasperation the night before turned into intrigue and curiosity the next day.  I actually watched the entire movie again the next night.  What I discovered was a beautifully and poetically created masterpiece that discards the narrative structure in place of disjointed memories and images.  The film is more like a painting in that to understand it each portion of the canvass must be mulled over and revisited to get the true impact.
The images in this film are absolutely stunning and unforgetable; the burning barn, milk dripping from an overturned glass...
It may go without saying but this film is for those interested in film as art and not film as blockbuster entertainment.  In fact, I'm sure that if this film were shown even in an art house half of the audience would get up and walk out.
