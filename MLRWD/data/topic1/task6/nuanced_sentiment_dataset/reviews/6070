Since its release almost two decades ago and subsequent transformation into a genuine entertainment franchise, RoboCop has been analyzed, psychoanalyzed, critiqued and its spare parts picked apart for rich sociological meanings and deep metaphorical layers.  He's a tormented Christ figure!  He's a noble Knight personifying our hopes and fears realized in one gleaming suit of high tech armor!  All that is definitely appropriate, but something has been left out of the equation.

RoboCop is just totally cool!

In that same spirit of intellectual analysis, let me try to decipher the "cool" factor of this now legendary sci-fi figure.  From Robby the Robot, to Gort to even Rosie the Robo-Maid from The Jetsons, robots have fascinated and thrilled movie audiences for generations.  They are our helpers, wacky sidekicks, our loyal protectors and sometimes even nightmarish Terminators.  However of all the robots we've been treated to on the silver screen, RoboCop may be the most intriguing and the one audiences root for the most.

Put simply, he's a cop and he's a robot.  Despite a more post modern treatment of the police as being less than exemplary or just flawed, our officers of the law remain respected members of the community.  When you combine the natural hero - the cop - with the natural sci-fi gadget  - the  robot - you get A MEGA-HIT which spawned two sequels, a TV series and comic books.  Also while Gort, Robby and Rosie are all full robotic creations, RoboCop's "heart" is provided by a human - Alex Murphy - played by the wonderful Peter Weller.  How can fans not root for a robotic creation which upholds the law, looks sleekly cool and is truly one of them?

When RoboCop says, "You're coming with me!" - is there anyone who could ever refuse him?
