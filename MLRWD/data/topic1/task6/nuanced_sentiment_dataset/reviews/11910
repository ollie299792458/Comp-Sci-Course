I was so looking forward to the release of Grease on DVD. Paramount certainly made us wait a long time for it but now that it's here I can't believe what shoddy treatment it has been given.
Ok so it's an old movie. I expect to see some grain on the film and all in all, I personally am not that disappointed with the picture quality but it all could (and should) have been so much better. 
To start off with the packaging is a cardboard case that will fall to pieces long before the DVD does. There are no commentaries, no production notes, filmographies, cast/character bios, gallery, outtakes, etc etc. All we get is a static menu, the movie trailer and 20 minutes of interviews with the cast (that were recorded 4 years ago to celebrate the re-release of Grease for it's 20th anniversary in 1998). There is also a songbook for anyone who still does not know the songs after 24 years !
There is a lot more material out there that could have been included - Maybe Paramount are working on a 25th anniversary release for next year and this was just the prototype !
