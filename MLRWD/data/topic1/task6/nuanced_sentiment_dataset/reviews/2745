I loved this movie.

Hayden Christensen does a terrific job as the real life Stephen Glass, journalist for "The New Republic," part time writer for "Rolling Stone" and "George," and full time con man.

He charms the educated staff at "The New Republic" where he's suitably diffident, helpful, and cunning.  He's also imaginative because most of his articles are made up.

His new editor, Charles Lane, finally catches on when a reporter at the "Forbes" online magazine becomes suspicious of one of Glass's articles and does some research of his own.  Lane (who now works for the Washington Post) is played by Peter Saarsgard who first defends him, then comes to realize that Glass isn't a kid being fooled by his sources; rather he's a full blown con man who's been fooling the supposedly sophisticated staff of a well-respected journal.

The tension between the two men is fascinating to watch.  As Glass reveals his dishonesty and tries to wheedle Lane into accepting his apologies, Lane's integrity and perception grow and we see what an appealing human being he is.  This very ordinary, decent man becomes a hero.

Saarsgard rightly won awards for his performance, but he wouldn't have been as impressive if he hadn't had the whining and self serving Christensen character to play against.

One point of concern.  In explaining the ease with which Glass fooled his fellow reporters and editors, the movie states that the average age at The New Republic was 26.  It also mentions that the magazine is a favorite on Air Force One, the President's plane.  My question is: Why are 26 year olds having such a profound influence on the president?
