Avoid this bloated piece of self-indulgence.  At two-and-a-half hours it should have been cut by a third. *Traffic* tells you everything you need to know about what's wrong with Hollywood films.  The fact that it has been nominated for, and won, so many awards is a comment on just how bad the movies surrounding it are.  The vaunted "multiple-plot" structure is clumsy, the endless tracking shots become boring very quickly, and realistic character development is non-existent (with the exception of the "Rodrigez" character).  The number of improbabilities we are asked to accept is an insult to the intelligence, and the smarmy ending screams of intellectual dishonesty.  A number of people are killed, but the emotional impact is practically zero.  If you get the chance to watch the British mini-series upon which this film is "based" (i.e. ripped off and dumbed down)grab it - then you'll see a real exploration of the topic of drugs and society.  In the meantime, Hollywood continues its run of cliche-ridden films posing as real commentary on complex issues and events (eg. *American Beauty* and *Saving Private Ryan*). The fact that the industry is so self-congratulatory about such dreck demonstrates its artistic bankruptcy.
