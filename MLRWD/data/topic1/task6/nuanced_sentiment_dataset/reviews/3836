I have mixed feelings about this video.  On the one hand, I think it has great songs and is a great classic musical.  On the other hand, I also have to admit to falling asleep while watching it, along with the other Amazon reviewer who admitted to this. :)  I think that this is worth watching because it was a great musical at the time and still has qualities which can be appreciated today.  I especially think it would be good for families with children to watch together, it is one of those Heidi-type movies about a young girl growing up.  However, I felt that by today's standards the movie was slow-moving and in some parts just plain boring.  It also bothered me that Leslie Caron, the actress who played GiGi, must have been at least 25-35 in real life (at least, that's how old she looked), and the role she was playing was that of a young adolescent girl.  It just did not seem real to me.  I think that those interested in musicals from the 50's and 60's will really like this.  However, I am not terribly interested in that genre, and for me this movie was not very interesting to me, except for some of the great, long-lasting songs that are relevant to any period of time.
