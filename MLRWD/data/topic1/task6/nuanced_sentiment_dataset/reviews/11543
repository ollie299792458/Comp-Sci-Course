Aladdin has never looked better.  This special edition DVD has all kinds of fun extras, deleted songs and scenes, games, and two hours worth of behind the scenes footage.  This boxed set not only comes with the platinum edition of Aladdin, but a little story book, and some of the original character sketches.

Most of the deleted songs and scenes are from the first story bored of the movie. This was when Aladdin was much younger, and had a mother.  "Proud of Your Boy" has become one of my favorite songs.  There are two games to play and few cute animated extras for the kids and those who are kids at heart, like me.  There are also interviews with almost every one that had a hand in the movie, and many more little extras that make this one of the best special edition Disney movies so far.

The little book is done with full color pictures and photos.  There are three chapters, a forward, and a storybook.  The book contains more behind the scenes facts and interviews. My favorite part though is the storybook of Aladdin with full color pictures.

The best part for me though was the character sketches.  Being an artist my self I love learning new techniques and looking at other professionals art work.  There is a sketch of each of the main characters that is signed by the main artist.  The sketches are not directly from the movie but how each of the artists portrayed their character.  And to put the icing on the cake each boxed set comes with a senitype of a piece of 35-millimeter film frame from the movie.  Mine happened to be of Jasmine and Aladdin flying on the magic carpet during the song a whole new world.

Overall the movie is a must bye if you are a Disney lover.  You may not want to spend the money on the gift box set for yourself, but if this is going to be a present for the holidays it is worth the money.
