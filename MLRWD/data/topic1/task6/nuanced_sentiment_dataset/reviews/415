i came across this by browsing movies.  someone mentions it is also called The Hour of the Pig.  That is the title i found it under at the rental store.  i wasn't thrilled by it which is why i only gave it 3 stars.  however, i am glad i watched it because i found it entertaining.  the plot is somewhat shaky, but tells of Richard Courtois who leaves the big city to be a lawyer (or Advocate) in the country.  He is appalled at the amount of superstition he find there and that he is asked to be the advocate for a pig accused of killing a young boy.  He meets  some interesting characters along the way.  Albertus the priest, Samira who he falls in love with, Seigneur of the local castle with a son who has a problem (i don't want to give it away).  he gets laid quite a bit, but has a hard time getting the woman he wants. in the end, he returns to Paris, realizing there is just as much corruption in the country as there is in the city.  and the knight in shining armor arrives in town, just as the witch prophecied.
