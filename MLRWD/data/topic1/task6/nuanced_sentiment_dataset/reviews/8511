I watched this on DVD this weekend and it appears that Michael was putting together an animated, special effect driven extravaganza to end all animated, special effect driven extravaganzas.  Although these are not the kinds of things that get me excited to see a concert, this looked pretty special.  A couple of observations:  It was reported that Michael was looking great and holding up well.  For the most part, that was true; however, while at times, it was apparent that Michael was holding back (he even says as so), it appeared, on occasion, that he lacked the wear-with-all to bring it 100%.  He also was frighteningly thin, he looked completely disheveled at the press conference announcing this tour.

I don't like him on the old J5 stuff.  He could no longer sing in that key (hasn't for years) and he does the Whitney-Houston-hurry-up-and-sing-the-lyrics-so i-don't-have-to-hit-the-notes-thing that is irritating.  Even when he was in chill mode, his moves out shined his dancers.  Make no mistake about it, even in slow-mo, Michael was the star of this production and deservedly so.

Speaking of dancers, there are a ton of male camel toe on display, with a scene which is solely devoted to the adjustment of said camel toe.  This in itself was a revelation and This Is It should have been nominated for an Oscar based upon this scene alone.

In conclusion, I have to say that once the special effects, animation and almost singing are stripped away Michael's main talents were his dancing, songwriting ability and his sense of the theatrical.
