This is a slice of life from New York in 2008 with a hard to find story and a narrative structure that bounces around here and there from muddled comment to half-hearted observation to low-key interview.  We follow a high priced escort to some of her "dates" and she has a bunch of conversations and almost kinda sorta makes a decision about a relationship in her life.  It's very low key, like a bunch of real people chatting in several normal moments.  It isn't a powerful narrative that leads up to an unforgettable, er, climax.  So it's got that sort of artsy tone for sure.  But I'm not sure its aspirations are as artsy -- i.e. aspiring to make some bigger, artistic point -- as the style.  At the end of the day it doesn't feel like a My Dinner With Andre or Five Easy Pieces or The Conversation or Lost in Translation or whatever artsy sort of low key but powerful film you want to mention.  Maybe I missed it but for me it just didn't add up to that.  Sometimes there can be a lack of emotion on the screen but powerful underlying emotion that sort of comes together in the end?  Didn't really get that either.  So to me it was kind of interesting to spend some time in NY and the fact that she had a career as a high priced escort was I suppose sort of interetsing for a while, but it never emotionally grabbed me. Cast was fine, including lead actress who apparently has a career in more "revealing" films...  She should try again with a character who has more to do.

I like the poster though.
