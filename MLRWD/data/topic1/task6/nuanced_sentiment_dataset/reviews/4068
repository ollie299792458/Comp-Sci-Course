I've been an avid follower of the low-fat diet craze ever since I started yo-yo dieting in college.  After having my son 2 years ago, I was over 215lbs, so I turned to cutting calories and, in August 2008, I started Nutrisystem.

I've lost over 73lbs so far, but after seeing "Fat Head", I'm finally seeing the facts of low-carb diets and I'm off the Nutrisystem wagon.  "Fat Head" is a funny and immensely informational documentary that goes into the "bologna" of the low-fat diet craze.  Like many people in the US, we're told that fat (especially animal fat) is bad and should be avoided at all costs.  Instead, have a piece of bread or a bowl of Special K.  "Bologna" says Tom and I believe him!

My father died a few years ago from a heart attack at 55.  He went on Atkins about 5 years prior and I remember comments afterwards like "there's no telling what that diet did to his system."  Since I can remember though, my father also liked his large share of carbs and battled his love of food and his desire to lose that last stubborn 30lbs.  After seeing "Fat Head", I can only now assume that all of those carbs he loved so much were the real culprit behind his heart disease- not the fact that he was on Atkins for 6 months.

Thank you Tom for making me see the light at 29, while I still have time to start making changes that will help insure I see 56.
