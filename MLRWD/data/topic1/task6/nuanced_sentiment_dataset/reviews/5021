Oscar Wilde's "The Importance of Being Earnest" is one of the most durable, witty comedy scripts in the history of English-language theater.  This production, which originally aired on the BBC's "Theatre Night" anthology, features three actors I usually enjoy: Joan Plowright, Paul McGann and Alison Steadman.  Yet, somehow, this production doesn't quite work.

Part of it is the pacing.  Part of it is the tone, which is too leaden at spots.  But mostly, I think, the problem is Rupert Frazer, who plays Algernon.  He's a good actor, but he's performing the show in a different acting style from the rest of the cast, and it's very jarring.  Also, he looks older than McGann, who is playing the older of the two characters.

There are some funny moments, including the well-played scenes between Cecily and Gwendolyn, but on the whole you're better off watching the brilliant 1952 movie version.  As someone else noted, the rave reviews below refer mostly to that film adaptation, which some customers mistakenly believe is on this tape.
