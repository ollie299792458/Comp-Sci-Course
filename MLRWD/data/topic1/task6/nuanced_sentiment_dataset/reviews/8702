I've seen all of Kubrick's movies except for Barry Lyndon and Dr. Strangelove (so this review might not be as accurate as a person would hope for) but this is his best work as far as I can tell. A brilliant and moral  "shocker" that really tries to dig deep into you and successfully  does so even after the first few minutes. People hate it because it  "glorifies violence." If this is true, then why does the plot  itself suggest that violence is an ugly thing? Alex gets my vote for best  costume of the 70's (I went as him for halloween) and he did a pretty good  job, although I hear him and Kubrick didn't say one word to one another  after production was completed. Was Kubrick an eccentric man? You bet he  was. This makes this movie all the more greater; he could care less about  the criticism. He knew what he was doing. He knew it wasn't going to be a  "normal" movie. And low and behold: it's still being praised  after 30 years and is really clicking with generation Xers for some odd  reason (LSD, anyone?). If not for all the rape and nudity scenes, this  would be the perfect film to show in a religion class to teach the kiddies  about the value of free will. And it's not a boring movie either. Kubrick  maintains a smooth story to go along with his perfectionist style and  creates one of the most beautiful and visually spectacular films of the  70's; or of any decade for that matter. Give it a shot, you're surely in  for a treat... unless your favorite movie is Halloween 3. :)~
