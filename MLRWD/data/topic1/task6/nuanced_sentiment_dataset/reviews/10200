I absolutely loved "The Mummy" and proudly added it to my DVD collection viewing it countless times.  Unfortunetly I can't say the same about "The Mummy Returns".  I saw this movie in the theaters with high hopes and came out shaking my head.  The Rock as the scorpion king just didn't work at all for me.  Why a wrestler was included in the cast is beyond me.  Like I said to my sister "Wrestlers are not actors!  They should stick to what they're good at and avoid hitting the movies."(~I feel the same way about these pop singers) I also thought that the guy who replaced Benny (I forget his name) wasn't nearly as good.  Also it seemed that the movie lost it's humor and the plain excitement of the first movie.  Instead they made it somewhat cheesy and wierd....  One more thing, in the first movie I admired the historical accuracy but the second definetly seemed to lose it.  But even so, I convinced myself that the third sequel is usually better than the second so I am eagerly hoping that they will fix their mistakes and bring back the exciting and fun elements of the first.
