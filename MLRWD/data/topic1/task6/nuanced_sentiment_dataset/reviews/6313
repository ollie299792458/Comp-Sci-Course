I'll be brief.  Good acting, sets, and costumes.  A poignant if sometimes rather coy screenplay that deprives us of some of the moments we would like to have witnessed.  This might actually be a virtue, though.  Poor Albert -- partly, it seems, because of horrible life experiences, and perhaps partly too by nature -- is always extremely reticent and perhaps, it would seem, not very intelligent.  This makes us feel even more sorry for him/her; but it certainly also makes this film less "entertaining" than some would want.  If you're looking for snappy dialog, you won't find very much of that here.  This, of course, is not necessarily a bad thing.  Drawbacks: slightly syrupy, modernish music, especially toward the end, which detracts from the weight of the film.  Also, at least in most scenes where there is action or strong drama, there is nothing but the usual sorry excuse for cinematography that seems to be so prevalent nowadays.  We are being trained to settle for cheap, reality-show esthetics.  This fact is not as sad as this earnest film's subject matter, but it still is sad.
