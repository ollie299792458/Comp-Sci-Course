When will Hollywood figure out that no matter how many charismatic actors and fetching Irish castles are crammed into a film, the thing won't fly without a decent screenplay?  I'm a huge fan of Julianne Moore, I enjoyed Frances Fisher's ultrachic character, and though I was never previously a fan of Pierce Brosnan, I found his rumpled sexiness appealing in this.  But the screenplay -- please!!!  Everything was a cliche and a stereotype.  Moore's uptight and clueless character, totally out of touch with her emotions and constantly bingeing on junk food (with no hint of bulimia), was particularly one-dimensional.  These two supposedly brilliant lawyers exchanged absolutely no witty repartee, whereas I was hoping for something along the lines of the Hepburn/Tracy classic, Adam's Rib -- silly me!  And there were certainly no unexpected plot twists, in contrast to the far superior Intolerable Cruelty.  Just a sappy, predictable, and ultimately very unsatisfying story which one can't help but feel must have been a disappointment to the talented cast.
