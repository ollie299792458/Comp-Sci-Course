Collective Soul in my opinion are one of the most underrated bands around today. Their songs are so well written and the variety of their sound is just amazing. I have been a fan ever since I first heard Shine back in 1994 and since then they have had my attention full-time. I have many favourites, whether it be ballads like the forementioned Shine, Run, Needs etc, or rock anthems like Heavy, Gel and Why Pt.2. Collective Soul: Home brings to reality what I have wondered for a long time.. What some of their songs would sound like accompanied by an orchestra, and after watching this DVD for the first time, I can say that it is just beautiful!! It brings a whole new level of enjoyment and respect to such songs as Youth, Pretty Donna, Compliment (well pretty much all of the songs!). I have seen them live twice here in Auckland new Zealand and I would love to see them again!! I am glad I ordered this DVD, it was well worth it and I can say I will be watching over and over again. If you love Collective Soul, get this DVD!!
