A note to film music enthusiasts:  The great British composer Sir William Walton wrote many works both for the concert hall and the screen.  His scores for all of Laurence Olivier's film adaptations of Shakespeare produced in the 1940s are legendary.  The original Angel LP of these works as rerecorded by Walton and the Philharmonia Orchestra became a high priced collectors item when it went out of print in the late 1970s.  When Olivier was signed to appear in "Battle of Britain" he naturally suggested Walton score the film, which he did.  But when the producer, Harry Saltman (with mostly James Bond films to his credit) heard Walton's score he rejected it outright, bringing composer Ron Goodwin in at the eleventh hour.  Goodwin's film score output at that point consisted of the insipid "Those Magnificent Man in Their Flying Machines" and little else.  Olivier's heroic response when learning that Walton had been thrown off the picture was to insist that his name be removed from the credits and all publicity unless Walton's music was restored.  A weak compromise was reached, and only a single original Walton sequence (an aerial dogfight without sound effects) was used in the final film.  It stands alone among the Goodwin music on the LP release of the Original Soundtrack Recording.  Thus, a DVD reissue of "Battle of Britain" offering an alternate audio option of Walton's complete, long lost music is indeed a cause for celebration.  It would be on a par with a DVD release of Hitchcock's "Torn Curtain" offering Bernard Herrmann's rejected original motion picture score instead of the John Addison score in the released version.  - Jamie Watson
