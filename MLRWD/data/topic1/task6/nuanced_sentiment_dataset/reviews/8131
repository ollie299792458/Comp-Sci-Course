I've seen this movie a few times, and I still think it's funny... but I don't consider it to be "one of the best ever", as some have perceived it.
A lot of what happens to Greg is identifiable by the average fiancee, which is what makes it funny, but some of it is so extravagant it's unbelievable, which I think detracts from the story a bit.  That, and the number of things which happen to him -- he hits Pam's sister in the nose with a volleyball, he sets their wedding gazebo on fire, he loses Jinx (the cat), tries to replace Jinx with a look-alike, he backs-up the septic system creating quite a mess in the backyard, et al.  It almost buckles under its own weight.
Yet, despite these things, it's still funny.  I think what keeps it afloat is the acting.  Stiller is perfectly set as the hapless fall-guy Focker.  DeNiro does very well playing the suspicious father / former CIA detective.  Wilson does pretty well as the "perfect" ex-boyfriend, although they probably could've gotten someone even better.  And Polo is well set as the beautiful girlfriend.  And they have a great upper-middle-class setting as well.
Avid Ben Stiller fans will probably be all over this movie.  I'm happy enough to see it on cable occasionally, but not to own it.  (Lastly, I'd actually like to put in a rating of 3.5 stars.)
