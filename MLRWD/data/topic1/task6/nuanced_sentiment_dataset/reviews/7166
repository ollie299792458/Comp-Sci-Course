The problem with this film is the character of Jim Garrison and especially the final scene where's he realises he's bundled the Clay Shaw prosecution and tries to get a 'guilty' verdict by making a speech about American Citizenship instead.  Shoddy lawman if you ask me.  He's not much of a father either.  His family sit in the courtroom at the end of the movie looking up to Garrison like he's some kind of hero and as if he was right to ignore them and treat them badly but he loses the case because of his own amateurishness not because of any judicial conspiracy.  Not much of a pay-off for his kids who've had to amuse themselves for a couple of years while their dad has his head buried in books.  I can't help thinking if it had been Atticus Finch he would have won the court case -and- been good to his family.
On the evidence Stone gives, it is possible to see Garrison as a courageous investigator but not as a rigorous or accomplished lawyer.  This for me definitely takes away from any of the points he's trying to make.  The Donald Sutherland theory is a little bit too much to swallow as well.  Most of the other people who have written about the JFK murder stop short of implicating Lyndon Johnson.  
It's a shame because it's obviously such a landmark movie, accomplished in so many ways and Stone ruins it by staying so true to the District Attorney.  Maybe this was part of the book deal but I would have preferred to see Stone be a bit harder on him.
