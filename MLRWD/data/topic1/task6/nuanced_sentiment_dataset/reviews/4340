I usually don't review movies, but I felt it would be beneficial to other people to warn them just how horrible this movie was. Denis Cooverman (played by Paul Rust), is a nerdy kid who is in love with a girl completely out of his league; Beth Cooper (played by Hayden Panettiere).

Denis has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. He is downright creepy with a stalker-ish fixation on the "most attractive" girl in school. Not only that, but he has the worst personality I've ever seen in a movie. When attempting to be humorous (which is quite often) he just comes across as such a loser and it's painful to watch. At the beginning of the movie, he calls out multiple people, one of which included his best friend for being gay. He pretty much alienates himself (well even more so than before since nobody liked him in the first place) from everybody.

Usually I root for the underdog, but that wasn't the case for this kid. I got about 3/4 of the way through the movie when I finally called it quits having finally succumbed to just how crappy it was and decided to turn the movie off.

I went into this movie with an open-mind, but after everything was said and done, I just couldn't bear watching the entire movie. Had Denis been played by another actor, it would have probably been so much better.
