If you're into historical & religious epics, which I am, this is a really good movie in spite of having a major amount of time/details cut from it for the theatrical release. These theatrical time constraints leave the viewer wanting more as far as character backgrounds at the very least. I would say that feeling of "something's missing" likely contributed to this movie being considered a flop in theaters, unfortunately.

If you're debating between purchasing this version <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AARKOO">Kingdom of Heaven (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHSVQ4">Kingdom of Heaven - The Director's Cut (Four-Disc Special Edition)</a> I'd highly recommend choosing the latter. I've seen & own both versions. The Director's Cut definitely provides a much higher level of the character & plot development originally envisioned by Ridley Scott which makes the movie all the more gripping.

This version, however, does contain 2 quite intriguing television documentaries (A&E's "Movie Real: Kingdom of Heaven"--approx 45 min & The History Chanel's "History vs Hollywood: Kingdom of Heaven"--approx 48 min) about the film that are not included in the 4-Disc Director's Cut, so I'm glad I own both versions!
