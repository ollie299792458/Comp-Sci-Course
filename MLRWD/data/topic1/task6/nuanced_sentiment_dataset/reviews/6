What a disappointment! I anxiously awaited the new Masterpiece Edition of Disney's Alice in Wonderland -- as no doubt did many other Disneyphiles -- only to be left sadly unfulfilled. This is one of my faves, and I hoped for something special, especially at the price. 
There is no audio commentary, and the art gallery is severely lacking. On both the "Snow White" and "Beauty/Beast" DVD sets (and others), there is virtual corridor after virtual corridor of conceptual drawings, abandoned concepts, and background sketches enough to follow the evolution of the production and marvel at the ingenuity of the Disney artists. Most of this is arranged by character. For "Alice," the stingy Disney people have arranged a couple dozen or so conceptual drawings in no discernible order with no captions or commentary. At one point, there are photos of Disney and his staff looking over mounted art and storyboards -- who am I looking at and what are they doing? What about the input of Mary Blair, whose art informs the entire production? Where are all the abandoned characters: the Lion and the Unicorn, the White Knight? In short, the story of the evolution of Disney's Alice is almost completely missing from this set. True, there is a song by the Cheshire Cat and a segment on how one song ended up in "Peter Pan." But anyone looking for an excursion into the world of the art of Disney's Alice will be all too disappointed (which is too bad, because the art of Disney's Alice is more creative than that for "Beauty/Beast") as will anyone interested in the process that goes into making a Disney masterpiece.
Why is there no audio commentary? Who puts out a DVD in this day and age without any audio commentary?
