I ordered this DVD used, because I wanted to see the part in which Gypsy Rose Lee does her "intellectual striptease", whatever that is. So I put it in and the only option it gave me was "Play Movie". No chapters, no scenes - just "play movie". Thinks I: "Fine. I'll just fast forward around until I see the part I am interested in." Nope: this DVD doesn't allow the viewer to skip around. You starts at the beginning an' you watches 'til the end. Clicking on the fast forward button allows you to skip to three spots which are always the same places in the film. Once you are at one of these three places, you can only skip to the next of the three: you can't fast forward your own choice of amount of the film. It's very frustrating. I don't want to have to sit through the whole dang film just so I can see GRL do her shtick. Why do companies release DVDs that withhold the power to choose where you want to watch? Is it cheaper that way or something? I don't get it.

Don't buy this DVD if you expect to be able to fast forward and rewind to find a particular spot.

And just in case you think I didn't think of it: I tried it in Real Player and Media Player Classic.

If I could, I'd give this DVD 0 stars...
