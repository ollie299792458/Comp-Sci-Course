Well I was fooled into buying this piece of anti-Chritian garbage;I may try and get a refund...it's muddled point of view was pointless but its agenda was clear -- to smear all religion as evil and irrational,one and the same - paralleling witchcraft and Christianity during the Dark Ages...

Obviously the director has used his talent, and I will admit he is a talented storyteller, for either misguided purposes or to deliberately distort and smear Judeao-Christian religion by generalizing "all" religion and religious belief by utilizing the period of the Dark Ages as the defining characteristic of "all" religios belief;  superstitious, ignorance and violence actally came as a result of  corrupt intitutions concealing the Bible from the masses and distorting its teachings to accomplish worldly goals of power and wealth.

The actors are very talented as is the director -- but in my opinion the content was garbage - biased subjective garbage

dont waste your money
