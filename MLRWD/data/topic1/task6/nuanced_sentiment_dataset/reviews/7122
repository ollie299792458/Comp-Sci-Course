Most Americans over 50 will never forget those 13 days, when the world teetered on the brink of nuclear holocaust. What this film does is to deliver a powerful dramatization of those events. Robert Greenwood is completely believable as Kennedy, and Steven Culp as RFK is positively spooky the way he nails that role.
The movie is incredible in its portrayal of how Kennedy was only barely able to keep matters from spinning out of control. Between his ultra right-wing generals spoiling for a war with the Soviets and a Kremlin in total chaos, it's astonishing we're all still here. This was one time in history when the will of good men prevailed.
It's interesting to view this movie in light of previously classified information about the Cuban Missile Crisis that has been disclosed recently by the Russians. The situation was far more dangerous than Kennedy realized. What we didn't know at the time was that the Soviets had stationed a wolf pack of submarines lying in wait inside the quarantine zone, each armed with a nuclear warhead torpedo, and with orders to use them against American naval vessels if attacked. One was. Yet the Soviet captain decided, miraculously, even as we were depth charging his sub, not to start a nuclear war. 
This is a timely film, and one that should be required viewing for all Americans.
