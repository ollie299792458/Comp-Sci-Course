the theatrical promos show a black man with a half naked white girl at his feet in chains, sort of a reverse slavery picture only of course this black man has really GOOD intentions for the white girl in chains, one wonders if the racial roles were reversed showing a white man with a black girl in chains at his feet, of course being white he would not be so unselfishly benevolant.

i mean please, the title itself should be a give away, BLACK SNAKE? whats the movie got to do with a snake?  MOAN? the sexual refrence is obvious except to the most obtuse.  this is whats now called 'playing the race card' or black exploitation film.

besides that its a film about a man who has no training in counseling, no training, in psychology, a man who couldnt keep his own marriage together being so arrogant as to believe he could 'help' someone with a serious mental disorder, (or not depending on your view) by chaining her up.

his own mental issues and internal fantasy world in which he finds he must help this half naked girl to find his own personal redemption should be the real story.

so what qualifies this person to be the great saviour of wayward nymphets?  well he is or was a musician, and we all know of course that musicians can accomplish what others can only dream of doing.  this movie reminds me of a book variable star that promotes the near deification of musicians, but in that book which is full of 'trained' counselors no one thinks twice about the girl who is going to have sex with everyman on the space ship before the journeys end.  our gal in chains was born too soon to be a fully accepted nymphet, in our time she's fair game to be humiliated, chained, and her mind altered by a blues musician to get her 'normal' again.

how about for black snake II he chain up a 'gay man' to cure him of his promiscuous ways?  black snake III will be lesbians, then Iv will be chronic masturbators.  oh the possiblities.

this movie isnt just bad, its absurd.
