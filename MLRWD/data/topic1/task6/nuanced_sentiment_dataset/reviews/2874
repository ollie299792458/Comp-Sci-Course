The reason behind my review on Shigurui is to concisely convey the truth behind this series, since the other reviews misled me to believing I would really enjoy it.

The cinematography and animation is truly the best part. The color and angles are spectacular. The flashbacks, the background nature shots, the characters facial expressions. This animation mix stirs up emotions without words superbly. Also the music compliments the animation very well. Much of it is slow, suspenseful, and well placed. If these two elements are what you enjoy most about anime, you will enjoy the series.

The overall experience was beaten, shot, and then run over repeatedly by the very dark, sullen, gross, depressing, hard to follow, and boring story. Read other lengthier reviews for details. Even with only 12 episodes, I still found it took myself over 3 months to finally get through them. I simply found better, more uplifting uses of my time. Also, there was redundant gore and very little action... a terrible combination. No big, elaborate fight scenes, just a slice of light or a sword flash here and a limb breaking or a head slipping off there. I gave this series a very generous 4/10 for the animation and music alone, but it won't be enough for me to ever watch Shigurui again.

Even after all my bashing you're still interested, at least take the time to watch a few episodes on narutowire or any other free online anime service first to see what you think. Even if you like what you see, try not to spend more than [...] 20 bucks for this series. You'll thank me.
