Ok, spiderman zombies are pretty silly and the superhuman ones are insane.  However, the whole movie was pretty decent all in all.  No, it is not a remake of Day of the Dead.  It says right on the box, based on the Day of the Dead.  What part is it based on, well, there are zombies.  Bub is in it as well as some of the other characters.  Other then that, not much else is the same.  The military pretty much stays together.  There is no psychological issues going on other then trying to survive a zombie attack.

If you take the movie as a zombie movie with pretty decent effects you will be happy.  If you are a purist that think a remake has to be exactly the same, you will go away unhappy.  Check out the review for a poor review.

I watch almost every zombie movie I can get my hand on.  Some are pure drek while others are enjoyable.  Seriously, this is an enjoyable movie.  Nick Cannon is pretty good contrary to what other people say and yes, there are lines in this movie that will be quoted for years to come.  Including "Why do white people always have to split up?"  Watch it and make sure you dont have soda in my mouth when they finally get to the bunker!

All in all this is good movie.  If you take it for what it is, a zombie movie.  No nitpicking about fast zombies, spiderman zombies, superman zombies.  Get by it and enjoy it for the fact that if these were the zombies humans had to face in the zombie armageddon we would be toast.

PS  Even the theory that zombies retain a little of their mind after they are created makes some sense to me.
