When I rented Elvira's first movie, "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark," I did so with the lowest of expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Ironically, because I liked "Mistress of the Dark" so much, I actually went into viewing "Elvira's Haunted Hills" with raised expectations, and was summarily disappointed.  Elvira (Cassandra Peterson, who also co-wrote the script) sticks with "Mistress of the Dark"'s formula of double entendres, goofy puns and silly sight gags, but her schtick doesn't have quite the same charm this time around. There are plenty of fat jokes at the expense of Elvira's maid Zou Zou (Mary Jo Smith) and "Rocky Horror"'s Richard O'Brien's role is essentially a self-parody. By the movie's final third, the humor is quite thin. There are a few laughs in "Elvira's Haunted Hills"' 90-minutes, but most are in the movie's first 30. I particularly enjoyed her musical number "Le Dance Hall." Ultimately, though, "Elvira's Haunted Hills" isn't as funny as the old Roger Corman/Hammer horrors it's spoofing.
