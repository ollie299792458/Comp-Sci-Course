WARNING: MY REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS

First off let me start by pointing out what the previous reviewer said about the plot being "easy to figure out" This is undoubtly true. It starts off with Praxston(the survivor from the first) in the hospital talking with Italian police about this "death factory" in Slovakia. After a few flashbacks he then goes into saying something about the bloodhound tatoo. The cop rolls back his sleeve revealing this tatoo and stabs in. Praxston then wakes up in a cold sweat next to his girlfriend who insists he seek help. NExt morning she goes downstairs to find Praxton dead and severed with her cat eating from his neck. Skipping ahead. Instead of 3 guys it's 3 girls. one hot, one ok, and one nerdy unatractive. They are joined by this tall extremely hot! Italian girl(who you can tell just by how she acts she is in on it) who takes them to the hot springs in Slovakia.  This movie was just pretty much the same thing all over again. Don't get me wrong, i liked the first movie, But this one repeats the same sequences, for example...Train conflicts, Porn(not as hardcore as the first) and the guys in black chaseing people down. There are also some parts that we're completely over doing it. The crime commiting children from the first movie are in this one to. One of them gets shot in the head, In another scene the main character cuts off one of the American exocutioner's genitals and throws in to a German Shepard dog who CHEWS IT UP AND EATS IT ON SCREEN!! that was a bit much. Another one in the end. The Hot girl gets decapitated and the children play soccor with her head. Theres even a scene where a sexy woman imitates Elizabeth Bathory and bathes in one of the girl's blood!  All in All this movie was OK and worth seeing. But don't expect to leave the movie theater too thrilled...or hungry.
