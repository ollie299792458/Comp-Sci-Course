I absolutely LOVE this cute Disney movie, as the Divine Miss M. as the wickedly funny Winnie Sanderson, the witch sister of two other witch sisters, Mary and Sarah (Kathy Najimy and "Sex In The City"'s Sarah Jessica Parker) are resurrected by naive teen (Omri Katz) and his cute little sister (Thora Birch) trying to impress a pretty girl (Vinessa Shaw) who lights a black flame. A little bit of belly laughs, but mostly chuckles. But what makes up for the humor is the hilarious hijinks that ensue when the sisters are resurrected-looking for young children to suck their youth from, so they can live forever. This cute Disney movie has sufficient humor. It also has a little romance, a teeny bit of horror, and genuine warmth are cleverly interwoven in this 93-minute movie. A obvious Halloween favorite. (Don't miss that musical interlude, where the Divine Ms. M sings the funny "I Put A Spell On You." It obviously does put a little spell on you.) You can also see it on HBO and Cinemax. Rated PG for mild language and some scary stuff.
