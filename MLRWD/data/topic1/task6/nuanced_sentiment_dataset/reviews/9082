ive been into the series since its inception, and was quite happy with the first episode. Episode two fell off a bit....
Now we have these two. Episode three is not all that bad, but lacks a cohesive story line. A major portion is given to 'the story thus far", and the ending just falls into an unbelievable mish mosh of events. Granted, I dont expect 'reality', but something a little more believable than this would be nice. I'll spare the details for those that wish to take a look themselves.
As for episode 4 (2nd story of dvd), what the hell happened???? I can't remark on the story, as I was so dissapointed I turned it off after 5 minutes......The problem is the art work. It looks like the cheapest work I've ever seen in a anime release. Simple colors, the drawings are extremely simplistic and done poorly. Most of the characters rarely even look like themselves. Anyone know what happened here? I don't know if this was a slap-dash production to release the dvd, but it's not even worth the tax I paid.....
Now I'm curious to see how the 3rd cd comes across.....
