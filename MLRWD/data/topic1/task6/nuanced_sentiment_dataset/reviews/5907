It still has a lot of the flash expected from any episode in the Fast & Furious series, but there's more to this movie than eyecandy: The dialogue is surprisingly rich at times, and the acting delivers: you really feel like there's something on the line for each main character, and when Brian has a tough choice to make, you can see it on his face.

As others have said, the plot for this episode is better than the other sequels. It ties into the first movie really well, showing the consequences of what happened in the first movie for all of the characters, eight years later. And, there is a lot at stake for each of the characters,so don't worry: it's not one of those "...remember when blah blah flicks". Indeed, there isn't a single flashback to anything from the previous movies. Rather, it ties all three films from the franchise together, and shows the complete evolution of FBI Agent Brian's character (Paul Walker), as he once again tries to choose between siding with the law, or with his loyalty to Torrato (Vin Diesel).

Yep, it ties everything together, even Tokyo Drift. So you end up enjoying all three of the previous movies more as you see how this one ties them all together.
