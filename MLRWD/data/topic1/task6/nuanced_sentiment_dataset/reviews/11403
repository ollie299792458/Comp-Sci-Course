Ok, those who did not take my other review seriously because of my grammar and spelling mistakes, I'll type it correctly this time.
1) Rubin had been in jail before. Why did he refuse to wear the uniform if he had committed the crime.
2) When Rubin was in jail, he committed over 16 years of his life to reading books on law. He appealed and appealed. The Judge said NOT GUILTY. Saying the state based thier argument on racial hatred rather then facts.
3) Any one who knew rubin closely knew if Rubin would hurt someone he would use his fists. PS. no murder weapon found.
4) Why would Rubin attract so much attention/media, if he was the clear-cut criminal www.graphicwitness.com/carter says he is. I'm not hiding it, please visit that site, see for yourself. When viewing just take a second to think, why would so much be written about him, why would his court case proceed for more then 2 decades and why would he capture the hearts of a nation, if thats what he was and is, a brutal thug. Nothing more or less.
5) Rubin is not as violent as some think. Yes he had a temper problem, but when asked about his sport (boxing) he said it was just a way to get paid. He didn't like it or hate it. It was just what he did. Also, now, Rubin is leading a protest to BAN boxing as he sees it as barbaric.
PLEASE, think about what you write about Rubin and whom it may affect, i wrote my other review in anger because i would picture Rubin reading all the disgusting things written about him. He rotted in prison for what, to be doubted and dismissed as a thug. I didn't write my review in anger this time, I still believe what I said in my other review, and to those who havent read it, plese read it, (excuse the grammar and spelling mistakes)and just take heed to some things I've mentioned. Stop stepping on this great fighters legacy.
