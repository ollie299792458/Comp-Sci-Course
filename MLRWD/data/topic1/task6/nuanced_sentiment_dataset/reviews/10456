After the greatness that was Desperado, I thought that a sequel with a bigger budget could only get better, man was I wrong. I didn't know that when people got shot orange sparks flew out of their chest and they flew 40ft across a room or that shooting random places in a bar (such as random glasses) made things explode over and over again and people fly all over the room. I also didn't know that someone wearing a T-shirt can get shot 12+ times in the chest with an assault rifle and still be in perfect health and having gun fights. I also didn't know that Mexicans can climb completely flat walls in churches when they are after someone, must be a special talent. Also, I don't think that people who just had their eyes cut out for no reason would be able to have and win many shootouts. I didn't believe that Salma Hyak being in the movie for under a minute makes her a main character and also that Enrique Iglesias is an action hero, HE'S A POP STAR! HORRIBLE CASTING! And WILLEM DAFOE LOOKS SO GREAT TAN! What a believable Mexican. And who could forget the lovable body guard who's having second thoughts about his line of work and who randomly carries around a hairless Chihuahua he dressed in cute pink clothes.  O yeah, to top it off, a horrible plot that makes no sense. If you liked Desperado at all, stay far far away. Those of us who have seen it, can only pray there won't be another.
