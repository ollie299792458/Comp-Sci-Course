All 3 of Rush's recent live DVDs (Rio, R30 and Snakes) are outstanding and worth owning.  It's simply amazing how guys their age can still put on as lengthy and energetic of a show as they do.  Whether buying a concert ticket or DVD package, you always get your money's worth.

From an audio standpoint, this new release is the best of the 3.  Just the 2-channel PCM mix blew me away with its clarity, balance and punch.  The picture is stunningly sharp, as good or better than R30.  There are plenty of cameras on hand to capture the band's brilliant stage set (love those descending lighting rigs).  A few too many S&A tunes strung together in set 2, but plenty of gems like "Witch Hunt" and "Bangkok" help balance it out.

The main problem with this DVD?  Editing.  It's good for the most part.  But there is one camera angle from crowd/floor level that the editor WAY overuses.  Frequently, this camera pans directly behind a row of heads in the audience, obscuring your view of the band on stage...sometimes even when Alex is soloing!  Once or twice during the show might not be so bad.  But as many times as it's done, it becomes distracting and highly annoying.  Seriously, I see the backs of peoples' heads enough when I'm AT the show; please leave that shot out of the DVD that people are paying $20+ for.  Also, the mix of shots is sometimes a little extreme.  One second, we're on a closeup of Geddy singing...the next second, we're in the very back of the hall and can only hear him singing.  I like active editing to a point, but this one occasionally jumps around too wildly at the wrong moments (R30 is superior from an editing standpoint; the bonus Atlanta clips are also better edited).  The closeups of the band playing though (when we get them for more than 2-3 seconds) are excellent, so like I said, it's good most of the time.
