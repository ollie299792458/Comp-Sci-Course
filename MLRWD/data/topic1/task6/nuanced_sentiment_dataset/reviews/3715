This is a long-waited DVD if you ask me.  Deffenitely.  I think audio and video qualities are much better than previously released DVDs or LDs.  It's a wide-screen or a letter-boxed, a high 16:9 aspect ratio picture with multiple audios and subtittles.  It also includes newly produced supplimental interviews with writer/director Peter Hyams and other specialists.  In addition to all of these, we can enjoy directors audio commentaries, which is very reare for Peter Hyams to review or make some kind of comments on the picture he produced.  He himself was saying he had never commented his picture after they were completed and released because there would have been anything for him to alter or change once they left him.  So, watching and listening to those commentaries themselves worth purchasing this DVD.  Jerry Goldsmith'd famous opening theme music is one another highlight to make the moview even more dramatic and gorgeous.  Everytime I see the red Dutsun 280Z sports car in the end I couldn't help dropping some tears from my eyes. Oh,one more thing to note: Yes, I deffinitely agree with the director on the point that this is probably the first mortion picture to feature two flying helicopters as human-like figures, pretending they are talking and nodding face to face each other.  The secenea were almost chilling.  I strongly recomemd to buy this DVD and re-experience the Capricorn incident happened in the late '70s again for yourself.
