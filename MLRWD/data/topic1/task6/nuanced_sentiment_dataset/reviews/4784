I expected this to be a great movie based on all the five star review. What I found was very disappointing, a movie that could have been directed by Daniel Ortega as a Sandanista propaganda film. First of all, the characters were very one-dimensional army evil FMLA good. Everyone familiar with FMLA, FARC or Shining Path wars knows there's evil on both sides, and it disgusts me to see one group portrayed as evil. I'm sure these atrocities occurred but the ware was 12 years long, and to put atrocity after atrocity make the movie too one-sided. The government troops were all portrayed as shooting kids, kicking priests in the stomach, abducting and raping women off the street, while the communist rebels are on the side of the people, play guitar and sing songs and cooking delicious communal kitchens, and playing guitar to soothe children while bullets fly. The priest gives mass in the streets and condemns the army as souless and evil. I'm sure they were trying to channel Archbishop Romero, but not everyone in El Salvador was on the rebels side right? There was another side, and it won, and El Salvador has peace now. The score of the movie reinforced stereotypes, playing romantic songs when the rebels attack, and scary music when the army attacks. It was like a bad comic book.  Just as the boy is going to be executed by the military for being caught at a rebel camp, the rebels counter attack and save him. I think one has to read between the lines. What was a 12 year old kid doing in the insurgent camp, fighting? probably. You think he's going to write that into the screenplay, or that he was just an innocent kid. Besides that,  the military tactics are childish and I found the movie to be a parody seen through the prism of PC thinking.
