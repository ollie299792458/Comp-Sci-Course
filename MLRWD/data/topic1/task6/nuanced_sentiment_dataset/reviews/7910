To paraphrase, 'no show should run over four to five years.'  That is insane.  M*A*S*H was an excellent show that kept fans watching for 11 years, and not just out of loyalty.  The creators, actors, directors, and writers of M*A*S*H realized that a good show should have a mixture of comedy and drama.  The variety of humorous and dramatic, heartwrenching episodes that season eight offers is just an example of why this show has captivated generation after generation of audiences over the thirty plus years since its debut.  I'm only 19, and I have seen every single episode of M*A*S*H at least three or four times, if not more.  I own every season thus far released. And season eight will hit my DVD player this afternoon.  M*A*S*H didn't rehash scenario after scenario; it presented the evolution of the characters over time, as the horrors and obscenities of war aged and wisened them over a few short years.  Buy season eight.  Buy 1-7.  And Buy seasons nine-11, yet to come.  They are well worth the money.  Quit after four or five years, I don't think so.
