I don't think Ray Bradbury transfers to the screen very well. I love reading his stories, but it's very rare to see a good screen adaptation. The Ray Bradbury Theater TV series was mostly pretty bad stuff, and the horrible film adaptation of A Sound of Thunder a few years ago was pulled from many theaters in less than a week!
In fact the only truly good adaptation that comes to mind was when "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" did "And So Died Riabouchinska" starring Claude Rains.
So when it comes to "The Martian Chronicles" it's no different. Certain things worked, and I didn't mind weaving Rock Hudson and Roddy MacDowell in and out of the various stories for television continuity. And of course not all the stories made it in. Some of what did came out excellent, such as Bernadette Peters as Genevieve Selsor, and the Million Year Picnic segment. But some of it was particularly bad. I couldn't stand the treatment of Yll and Ylla.
The "score" consisting of cheesy disco music and weird synth sounds was actually kinda fun, in that campy so-bad-it's-good kinda way.
Overall, I'd say it's something every Bradbury fan should have and when people come over and look at your DVDs and ask what that's all about, take it away and hand them the book!
