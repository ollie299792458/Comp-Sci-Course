This is the dumbest movie I ever saw. If anyone wants a lesson on making a dumb film, watch this one. I thought Mills &amp; Boon turned out trashy romances, but this film makes all those romances seem brilliant. I cannot  imagine what made Kilmer and Sovarino decide to act in this extremely  unfeeling film. Didn't they read the script before agreeing to act in it?  It is a film that appears to have been made by completely unfeeling robots  - everything about it: the script, the direction, the editing. I watched it  a few hours after watching the Jessica Tandy-Kathy Bates starrer  "Fried Green Tomatoes" where every frame was full of depth,  meaning, feeling, brilliance. I have never been so disappointed as I have  watching "At First Sight". A completely unconvincing meeting  together of the main characters, Val Kilmer acts the part very clumsily and  keeps grinning right through like he had his mouth split open with a  baseball bat. And Mira Sovarino, the less said the better. Pathetic. I want  my money back. Even the dumb Indian films I read about must have their  redeeming moments compared to "At First Sight". Disgusting.
