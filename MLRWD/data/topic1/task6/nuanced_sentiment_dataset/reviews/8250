Let's just hope they got the transfer done nice and clean this time (Blu-Ray) as the THX anamorphic release done a few years ago(This one) had picture problems with Fight the future. No matter where I purchased it.(8 different copies) They all had the same problem. Maybe you won't see it. A line going across the screen just above the middle of the picture for the first half of the movie.(Seemed to be a layer problem as when the layer changed at the dead end road before the train scene it went away) FOX says we have never heard about or seen this problem but they would not watch the disc when I ask them to as well. THX won't even respond as well. The first release that was letterbox (4x3) format was clean no problem there but the anamorphic picture is much better when made correctly plus they added DTS to that as well. I have high hope's it will look great on Blu-Ray. We will see. If you don't need the DTS and just want a clean picture you might look to purchasing the 4x3 letterbox one.
