I would say this movie is for people who are quick thinking, quick to figure things out and make jokes,  I'm a fan of GILMORE GIRLS, so I would compare the wit of this movie to that.

Basicaly all I knew about this movie before I saw it is that it's about these professinal bachlors that crash weddings to meet girls.  Being at the cinema to see the events of the movie unfold made it a lot more interesting, so I won't give anymore of the plot away.  I will say, though, that it makes me feel like I should crash a wedding!  The movie gives you an upbeat, witty feeling after you've seen it!  Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are very funny and the situations they get in are relateable... Owen Wilson is very charming, sweet, funny, and likeable.  Rachel McAddams is a beauty.  I really felt for her charecter, and her situation made me think about what I really want in a relationship.

the only drawback to this movie, in my opinion, is Vince Vaughn.  Although he's funny in the movie, it dosen't last very long.  I've gotta give him credit though for putting up with doing so many awkward scenes and being the butt of all the jokes. I didn't care for his gf in this movie either.
