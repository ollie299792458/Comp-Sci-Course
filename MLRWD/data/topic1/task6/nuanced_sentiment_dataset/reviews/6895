For starters, I found this movie to be .. less scary than a salt shaker.  (Which, in its own right, is frightening compared to this movie.)  I did, however, enjoy the acting of Famke Janssen (Evelyn) and Taye Diggs (Eddie) and am very very pleased that the "token" black man in this horror flick was not at all the "token".  I won't spoil the ending, but I'm pleased that this occurred.  Geoffrey Rush as Mr. Price was fun in some scenes, but I think I enjoyed him much more as the dry and witty Marquis de Sade in "Quills".  
Acting aside, however, which was horrendous enough on its own, the plot was intricate enough.  I have a huge proclivity for films that have characters with god complexes.  It seems to make the movie a double-movie, which is always ironic.  It was Hollywood to a T, however, and the only scares were in the imagery, in the cinematography.  One scene with a woman video-camera-ing an empty gurney sees it through the screen as filled with doctors and a patient .. when the doctor turns to stare at her, that was delicious.  The roller-coaster at the beginning was also unexpected and fun.
I'd like, however, to see the original film, as most Hollywood revivals of older horror (that favour atmosphere and acting over SFX) seem to cater to a specific audience.  This was, however, a fun movie.
