Manhattan(1979) re-visits some of Woody Allen's themes that he explored in the Oscar winning Best Picture of 1977, Annie Hall. The excellent two part documentary by PBS, which aired in November, compelled me to watch this great film once again. I must say that, over time, Manhattan has aged quite well. The cinematography remains excellent and perhaps is the best of any Woody Allen film. Radiating in gourgeous black and white, and enhanced by the great use of George Gershwin's music, the film remains a true feast for the eyes. So much so that during the Academy Awards for films of 1979, the master cinematographer Haskell Wexler raged to the Academy that one of the best names in his field, Gordan Willis, had been left off the ballot. Of course, prior to films made up to 1967, Oscar separated between black-and-and white and color films, as well as in Art Direction and Costume Design. Beginning in 1967, films made in color as well as in black-and -white were distilled into one category. Woody re-visits his themes of troubled relationships, cerebral friends, and comedy. Mariel Hemingway did receive a Best Supporting Nomination and Woody did receive another screenwriting nomination, but neither won an Oscar. Yet Manhattan remains heartwarming, insightful, poignant, funny and a true feast for the eyes! I urge all to give it another look. You won't be sorry, but pleasantly delighted!
