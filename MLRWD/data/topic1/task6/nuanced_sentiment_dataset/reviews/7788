In this one Johnny Depp portrays a gypsy.  With long hair, a thin moustache and a Romanian accent, he is sly, seductive and sultry.  He appears in about 22 sequences. Cate Blanchette is over the top but so is the character she's playing. Set in the decade between 1927 and the rise of Naziism in Paris in the late thirties, the plot follows the life of a young girl whose father has left for America and who is separated from her family and friends by a pogram.  Ricci plays her as a trauma victim, quiet and depressed through most of the film.

This is the problem - the center of the film, the girl herself, is so boring, so uninteresting, that we find it hard to believe that the charming, man-hungry Blanchette befriends her and that the seductive Depp falls in love with her.  It just doesn't make sense.  She remains a child throughout the film, silent, hardly talking, occasionally singing.  She never becomes a woman emotionally so the interest of others in the narrative doesn't ring true.

The score is truly lovely, weaving some lovely arias around original scoring. The cinematography is good, darkly atmospheric - her world has little light in it.

The story itself is as depressing as it could be.  Hiding her identity as a Russian Jew in Nazi-occupied Paris, she is lusted after, betrayed and finally shipwrecked in her attempt to get to America and reunite with her father who believes her to be dead and who has gone on to father a second family.

The film's title is meaningless and hardly one to attract audiences.  The only man who cries in the film is Depp during their last night together, but since no point had been made before that he doesn't cry, the scene is meaningless.  ALso, one would think a title would refer to a main character, not a supporting one.  Even GYPSY LOVER, bad as it is, would be a more apt title.

To sum up, a depressing film about a depressing girl, made bearable by Depp's sensual performance and Blanchette's exuberant one.
