How many times can you repeat the same action when the basic premise was as simple as this one was?  Over and over and over.  Talk about beating a dead horse.

I didn't purchase this disc set to review the histrionics of the romance and abdication.  That could have been completely reported with a "screen crawler." Having all the characters repeat and repeat the facts (few as there were) became boring.

I wanted to be entertained with glamourous people dressed in beautiful gowns and dripping with, at least the look of fabulous Cartier Jewels, instead of the "Woolworth Paste Collection."  The men's wardrobes were far more elegant and expensive looking than the female actors wore.  The Dutchess of Windsor made Coco Chanel world famous because of her vast collection of that particular designers signature collections.  Not a Chanel Suit to be seen.

I was disappointed in this mini-series.  If you've already purchased it, I hope you enjoy it.  If you haven't bought it yet, don't.
