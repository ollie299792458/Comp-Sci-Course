This is a movie I expected to like, if for no real reason than that I really dislike Michael Moore, and he seems like such an easy target for satire.

However, this movie is strictly amateur hour.  The jokes aren't funny, and are often so cliche - listening to the DVD commentary, the director was proudest of a joke where the chanting crowds just mindlessly repeat was the Michael Moore character says.  It's a scene I've seen many, many times before, most notably in "Life of Brian," and just wasn't funny.

There were a very few jokes that were funny and even politically savvy - I liked the take on Fundamentalist Christianity being just as bad as Fundamentalist Islam, where people complain how they can't get on board an airplane because of Fundamentalist Christian attacks.  Then it goes on to people getting naked for airplane security checks, and having to scan underwear, and it's yet another joke that wasn't funny the first time I saw it, much less the thousandth...

These examples may make it sound like there were a bunch of jokes, many of which failed but some of which stuck.  But really, I found the movie more inane than anything.  This movie is on the same level as all the other straight-to-DVD releases Zucker has been shoveling out, or which prominently feature Lesley Nielsen on the cover.

The only people who are going to say they like this movie are solid Republicans desperately looking for a Republican-leaning movie.  And I can't believe they're really, actually like it - just they're happy to support any movie which features a scene where ACLU lawyers are getting shot at.
