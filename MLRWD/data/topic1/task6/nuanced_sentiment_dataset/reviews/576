Ya, I have seen this movie several times. My ex-husband thought this was the greatest thing ever, but I simply could not get into it.

The jokes are seriously dated, and Ted Knight's character, Judge Smalls, just seemed like a pervy creep to me. His demeanor creeped me out to no end. Rodney Dangerfield and Chevy Chase are the only redeeming characters in this flick. Bill Murray's role as a moronic groundskeeper who is obsessed with killing an annoying animated gopher is one of the lowlights.

I also despised the caddy who thought he got his girlfriend pregnant. Later, she is found dancing around the golf course like an idiot because she finds out that it was a false alarm. That made me want to slap her. Has there ever BEEN less chemistry between a supposedly romantically-involved couple onscreen? I think not.

I know that Caddyshack is considered a classic by many people, but I just dont get it. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of Dangerfield's and Chase's performances.
