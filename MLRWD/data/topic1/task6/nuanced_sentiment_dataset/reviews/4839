The no impact man annoyed me deeply on a personal level.  There is something about his entire persona I find offensive.  He appears to be an extremely self-absorbed, self-righteous person. Although I applaud his decision to make no impact upon the planet, he comes across as smug and not very likeable.  The movie reminded me of a bad Seinfeld episode, filled with pretentious, narcissistic, self-centered New Yorkers who think the world revolves around them.

I know Colin and his wife took part in a noble experiment, and the message is one I believe in and think should be encouraged, but both Colin and his wife come across as mean, horrible people.  This film would make good propaganda for anti-environmentalists that shows just how strange the environmental movement can be.  The message could be misconstrued that you have to give up any semblance of a normal life to save the planet - a philosophy that is not necessarily true.

Oh, and did I mention that the movie is really boring?  Sorry, it just wasn't put together in an interesting way.  It may have made an okay one-hour public television special, but even at 90 minutes it was pushing the snooze factor.
