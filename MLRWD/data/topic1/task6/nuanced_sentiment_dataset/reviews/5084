just a tip that box set IS NOT worth it.  If you want all the movies> walmart has halloween 1 for $10, H-2, H-3 combo pack for i think $8.00 and then theres BEst bUY whom has H-4, H-5 for $15 ea.  Walmart just got in recently a NEW odd never seen b4 till recent a box set of Halloween 6, 7, 8 combo for $15.  Buy it if yur a hard  core fan.  Good $ price for 3 movies!!  Plus just about anywhere has the 2007 vs of halloween for about $20 i think.  so for bout $85  you can get all the Halloween movies if you got the $$$ and are a hard core fan!  SOOOO wish a produceers cut of  H=6 would come out. I heard its about 45min of additional footage that the theatrical release didnt show?? for whatever reason... SO there you go... AND another Halloween movie a sequal from last years (2007) will be out in 2009 i heard>?? who knows the more remakes and or ssequals they make there just ruining what few great halloween movies there are currently. If there going to make a sequal  make one w/ john(josh hartnett) lauries son coming back and facing michael one last time or something like that.  who knows what those joker producers will end up doing???
