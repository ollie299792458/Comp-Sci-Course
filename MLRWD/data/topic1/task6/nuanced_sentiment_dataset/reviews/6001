I fell in love with the Anne of Green Gables series when someone loaned us the first movie.  I immediately went out and bought the books and found the 2nd movie that Sullivan made.  The first two movies were outstanding and did an excellent job of telling Montgomery's story of Anne.

Like many other fans of Anne, I anxiously awaited the third movie, hoping to see the marriage of Anne and Gilbert and the beginning of their married life and the starting of their family.  There is wonderful drama in the books of this period of their lives.  I thought, too, that a final movie would be very successful if it dealt with the wartime drama situated around Anne & Gilbert's oldest daughter, Rilla.

What Sullivan presented, however, after two wonderful movies, was not only a desecration of Montgomery's writings, but also just a bad movie.  If you have recently discovered Anne of Green Gables and love these tremendous stories, I strongly recommend that you buy the first two movies.  By staying close to the text, Sullivan managed to deliver two incredible movies, and Meegan Follows is simply incredible.

Based upon Sullivan's commentary's in the movies, however, we should consider ourselves lucky he got these movies right, because he really doesn't seem to "get" what makes Montgomery's stories so wonderful.  This is even more apparent with the 3rd movie, which I can only guess Sullivan put out there to try and make some extra money.  First of all, it has nothing to do with Montgomery's actual stories.  Sullivan should have kept to directing and left story telling to Montgomery.  Second, the movie is just bad.  It was a couple of hours that, unfortunately, I'll never get back again.

As other reviewers have commented, I own the first two movies and love to watch them with my family.  They are *perfect* family movies with incredible stories and superb acting.  The last movie shouldn't even be considered part of the story.  It's bad.  Don't waste any money on it.
