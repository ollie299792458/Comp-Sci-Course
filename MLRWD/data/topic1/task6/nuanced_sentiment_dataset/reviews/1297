Phife couldn't accept his diabetes, overdosed on sugar, ruined his health, turned all bitter. Tip didn't like his attitude, and took t personal. They threw it all away over some really stupid ish. I love Tribe's music. Low End Theory and Midnight Marauders are two of the best albums in the genre. I always felt they could have done EVEN MORE (especially if you listen to J Dilla's beats on Beats Rhymes, and Life (the album)). Now I know why it all fell apart - damn. All I can say.

But that's not a review of the documentary you say. The best part of an hour and a half follows a really pathetic, really childish beef, that tore apart the best crew in hip-hop. Sound fun to watch? Only way I see someone wanting to see this, is if you're into Tip and Phife as people. Trust me, you won't like Tip and Phife as people after you've seen this. It's feuds like this, along with artistic laziness, that are the reason hip-hop is dead.

The only redeeming feature of this documentary is the 2008 Rock the Bells concert footage. Loved the performance of Excursions (Mos and Tip reading the lyrics off Tip's shirt - you have to see it). Phife always said that when they were coming up, as ten year old kids, all they wanted was to sound like their heroes. When you see these live performance, you can sorta hear flows that sound like certain crews and certain emcees that were stars in the 80s (Run DMC, Beastie Boys, LL). You don't hear that on the records. That's not enough to make it watchable though.
