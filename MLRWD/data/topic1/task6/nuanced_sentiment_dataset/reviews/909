Like the Star Trek franchise of movies, STARGATE is actually a sci-fi film with an even mixture of intelligence and blazing action.  The intertwining of an alien being the explanation for Egyptian history and mythology is not  new, but is handled in a clever and exciting way.  The effects are  excellent as is the production design.  My favorite being the rings that  shoot down to transport people along with the excellent sound effect that  accompanies them.  The Stargate itself is also a design masterpiece; and  the geometric concept behind a Stargate and the point of origin; and the  idea of encoding the chevrons to get to another planet in any part of the  universe....
The viewer will see how the alien influences Egyptian  historical culture, (or how Egyptian historical culture influences  Hollywood aliens!).  
As usual, James Spader does a fine job.  His  scatter-brained, yet highly intelligent, Daniel Jackson is charming with  just enough nerishness to pepper his character.  Kurt Russel does well as  the taciturn Col. O'Neil, still mourning the death of his son.
The only  disappointment is the last twenty-or-so minutes where the action is  definitely progressing at a breakneck speed, but in all honesty, we never  do care about the otherworldly extras enough to get lost in the suspense of  saving their planet.  However, this is definitely one of my all time  sci-fi/action favorites.
