Director Zack Snyder has a keen sense of visual style. His films are a visual feast for the eyes: 300, Watchmen. Sucker Punch is no different, but for me, where it has a lot of style, it is missing substance.

Browning plays Baby Doll, a young girl institutionalized by her abusive stepfather. She dreams an alternate reality in which she is in a dance hall/whorehouse, and devises a plan of escape. What makes it more crazy, is she creates another alternate reality, within the alternate reality. Whenever she is supposed to be dancing, she's actually fighting alongside her fellow inmates against hordes of demon Nazis searching for the things she needs to escape.

I can see how writers Snyder and Steve Shibuya are trying to make something out of all of this, how we sacrifice for those we love, but it's just an excuse for a creation of another fantasy world where all the sexy girls are dangerous assassins, carrying big guns and samurai swords. They kill demons, fight a dragon, and blow stuff up.

These action scenes are pretty cool, but as they exist as a coping mechanism of Baby Doll's incarceration in a mental institute, they are incidental and unnecessary. Just an excuse for action scenes.

Ultimately, Sucker Punch feels like two different movies jammed into one. But, unlike peanut butter and chocolate, they just don't go together.
