Okay, this movie was exactly what I expected when I received it.  I am glad that I didn't pay for it, but I also dont feel that I wasted 2 hours of my life watching it either.  So for the review, here goes:

The plot is the usual Military science gone rogue and needs to be dealt with.  They actually poke fun at this plot in the middle of the movie.

The good about this movie, from a guy's point of view, is that it takes place in sunny warm Mexico.  Because the sun is bright, the picture is bright and sharp. Because its in Mexico, the colors are vibrant and the scenery is beautiful.  Because it's warm, there are lots of beautiful women in very small bikinis all over the place.  There are guys too, but I didn't pay much attention to them.

As expected though, there is some bad and some really bad.  The bad is the CGI.  You can tell that this was a low budget movie with limited resources.  The CGI was about equal to the special effects done in the 80's and 90's.  Not near the quality of a blockbuster of today, but acceptable for what it is.  The really bad, is the acting.  It seemed that no one either read over their lines before they got to work, or that they were pulled off the street with no formal training in acting.  Even Eric Roberts, the biggest name in the movie, seemed to be reading off note cards in all of his scenes.  It was just bad acting over the whole of the movie.

So, if you are into "B" movies and know that this was only made for entertainment value, then you might like this movie.  If you are looking for the next "Titanic" movie, look elsewhere because this isn't it.
