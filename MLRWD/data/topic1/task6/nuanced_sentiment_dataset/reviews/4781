The Feb. 1, 2005 2-disc Special Edition release of "CHARIOTS OF FIRE" is very special! First of all, on disc 1, we get a very nice wide-screen (1.85:1 ratio)version of the feature and the option of a very interesting commentary track by director Hugh Hudson.

Disc 2 offers two new documentaries that are way above average. "Wings on Their Heels: The Making of Chariots of Fire" has interviews with almost all of the surviving artists who appear in or worked on the film. We get a great understanding of just how difficult it was to get the film made at all. The excitement of Oscar night, when the film unexpectedly took the "Best Picture" honor, is captured with clips from the show and new information from the producer, director and actor Ben Cross. A very informative job has been done in helping us to understand how this "cinderella" film made it from original screenplay to one of the finest films of the 1980s. The "thrill" and the "pride" that the cast and creators had in making the film is strongly felt.

  The second documentary, "Chariots of Fire: A Reunion", was filmed in England and reunites together in one room, three of the actors along with the producer, director and cinematographer. They converse back and forth, sharing many special experiences that they had with the film. I found this to be fascinating.

  The third "Extra" in the inclusion of 16 minuntes of very interesting scenes that were not used in the final film, including a scene that appears in the British version of the film that was removed for its American prints. Also there are two screens tests, one each for Ben Cross and Ian Charelson that are fun to see -- and the U.S. theatrical trailer.

  I am pleased with this DVD and highly recommend it -- "CHARIOTS OF FIRE" now has the quality release that it deserves!
