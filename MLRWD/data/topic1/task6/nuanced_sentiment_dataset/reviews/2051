When I was younger I used to read comic books very frequently, but as I've grown up my interest in them has failed. It got to the point that I am only vaguely familiar with any modern day comics. I was NOT familiar with Hellboy prior to my viewing it. However, a friend asked me to go see it and being that I work in a Cineplex I was able to see it free of charge (which may have helped to secure my enjoyment).

I found that Hellboy was an extremely entertaining film, not just as a comic book movie. The various characters in the film were all interesting, in particular our hero. I wouldn't call this a great film, because I felt like there was something missing at the end of the movie. I did however enjoy it immensely, enough so that I've purchased this edition of the film.

My only disappointment came as I found out from my manager that there is a 3 disc directors cut coming out within the next few months. Keep that in mind when purchasing. That's the reason for the 3 Star Rating. The film itself was very enjoyable, worth of a four star rating in my opinion; However the fact that another edition will be available shortly detracts from its worth.
