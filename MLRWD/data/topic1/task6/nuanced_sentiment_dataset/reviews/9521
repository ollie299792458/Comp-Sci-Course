Spike Lee's malcolm X in my opinion is one of the great fil Bio pictures  of the 90's. It's easily Spike Lee's most ambitious effort to date. The  film scope is expansive. The story ranges from the streets of Boston to the  city of Mecca. The films look is very rich, with vibrant colors and sets.  The cinematography is excellent as usual from Ernest Dickerson who goes  into his usual bag of visual tricks. Malcolm X has a look that's all of  it's own. It has the look and polish of a big studio movie. There's even a  dance number that's a sight to see. The cast is impeccable.  Stand Out  performances go out to all of the cast. Al Freeman Jr. is a virtual clone  Elijah Muhammad. His role should have at least earned a nomination for best  supporting actor. Delro Lindo also stands out as the wicked number runner  West Indian Archie. Angela Basset providesample support as Betty Shabazz.  And Albert Hall is splendid as the ficitious Baines. Hey even spike lee has  his moments althought I think he should've skipped out on this shot. But  the real star of this movie is Denzel Washington. His performance simply  breathtaking. He is Malcolm X. He utterly becomes him down to his  mannerisms ,speech patterns, he even look more than a little bit like him.  I think this was his best on screen  performance that should have earned  him an Oscar. Talk about robbery. His performance simply towers above the  rest of the cast. 
In a fair world this movie should've won  at least  three or four oscars. But unfortunately many in the hollywood community  refused to give Malcolm X a fair deal. So unfortunately the movie (with the  exception of best actor and best costume design) was virtually shut out of  the Oscars. Politics.
Arguably Spike lee's best film, although Do the  right thing is very close. It's a wonderful sprawling oddesey of the life  of one of the most influential Black leaders of the 20th century.
