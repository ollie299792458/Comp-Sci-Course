I actually watched this movie three times to absorb its true inner badness, and I found that the film is truly horrible on more levels than you could possibly imagine.  The acting is deplorable, to be sure.  The only one who's even putting forth any real effort is Raul Julia, who was WAY too wonderful an actor to have been tricked into making this abomination.  Of course, Van-Damme is about as believable and emotive an actor as Carrot Top, so you should know what to expect.  As for the rest of the cast, well, let's just say that the actor's didn't do their own matrial arts; the martial artists did their own acting.  (I know that's an MST3K rip-off, but that's exactly where this movie belongs, really).
The plot is pretty much a bunch of random scenes put in a blender.  We go from one unbelievable situation to another, into territories that neither make sense nor entertain.  It amazes me that for all the impressive gadgetry and special effects, this is still no more intelligent or enlightening than the "Guess what? I'm a man!" episodes of the Jerry Springer show.
If you love the video games and are truly curious about the movie, skip it anyway.  Trust me.  I've seen this movie three times for you people.  Along with binge-drinking,coke-snorting, and violent car crashes without seatbelts, this is one of the most brain-damaging experiences one can undertake.  Next time anyone asks if you want to try this movie, JUST SAY NO!
