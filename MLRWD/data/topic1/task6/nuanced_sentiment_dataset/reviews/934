I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm 21 years old and I think Pee-Wee Herman (Paul Reubens) rocks! I recently purchased both Pee-Wee's Playhouse DVD's, # 1 and # 2, and now I own all 7 seasons of this cool show. It's not nearly as childish as Barney & Sesame Street. You won't see a bunch of extremely hyperactive kids singing kiddie songs. Sure, there are children on Pee-Wee's Playhouse (the "Playhouse Gang") but these kids aren't as annoying as the ones on Barney, I promise you that. And Plus, they don't appear on every show. Simply put, you don't have to be an kid to enjoy this show. I'm living proof of that. I'm glad that these DVD's have got good star ratings. They deserve it. And I'm sick of people talking smack about Paul Reubens simply because of once particular incident at a pornographic theater! You know what? Who gives a darn! Paul Reubens is an adult entertainer as well as a child entertainer. I know he's now in his early 50's, but I still wouldn't mind if Paul returned to the big screen as Pee-Wee Herman one more time! Hey, why not?
