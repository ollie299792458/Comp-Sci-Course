In a lot of ways, Philip Seymour Hoffman is the movie.  He's in every scene.  The story is based on a true story about a gambling addicted loan officer who "loans" himself some of the bank's money to support his habit.  In life, he's a nobody.  He wouldn't be noticed by anyone.  But with the bank's money and his penchant for losing big, he becomes somewhat of a VIP in the casino he frequents.  It's amusing to watch him walk into the casino and have everyone make a big deal over him.  He gets nice suites and meals compliments of the casino, but does not seem interested in either.  He's there for the thrill of gambling.  As you watch the movie, you see that his situation becomes out of hand.  How could it not?  Mahowny loses.  He never comes home a winner.  At one point Mahowny seems to be in the verge of turning things around for himself.  He even somehow is able to find a woman (Minnie Driver) who wants to be with him.  But gambling always wins out.

Hoffman's portrayal is even keeled and never seems over the top.  As a matter of fact, there isn't much to his character.  It's difficult to determine whether or not you like him.  For me, that's the weak part of the movie.  The movie's main character is bland and ordinary.  What he does is anything but ordinary, but that isn't enough to carry the movie.  In real life, things may be just like we see them here.  A one hour documentary on the true story would have been just as satisfying. I would have liked to have seen a little more put into Hoffman's character.  Ordinary is fine in real life, but I want to see interesting people when I watch a movie.  This movie is worth watching.  A more recent Hoffman film had Hoffman playing a similar character in a more intriguing role.  Check out "Before The Devil Knows You're Dead".
