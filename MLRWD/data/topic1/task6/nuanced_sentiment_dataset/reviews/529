I'm really glad I did not pay big bucks to see this movie in a theater, but it was entertaining enough to spend a few bucks.  This is not an awesome action movie or the best mystery or thriller so don't get it if that's what your looking for.  I'll say:  it's pretty good.

The story follows Jill (Amanda Seyfried), who was kidnapped in the past but police could never find any evidence of the crime or kidnapper.  She was involuntarily committed in a psych ward after the police don't believe her.  Now, Jill's sister is missing and she believes that the kidnapper has returned.  Unfortunately for her, the police again don't believe her.  Jill frantically searches for her sister without police help and follows the clues find the kidnapper before it's too late.

Here's the good news: the story keeps you guessing and you'll never guess how it ends.

Here's the bad news: the ending is anticlimactic, Jill is an unsympathetic character to follow, and I found it sprinkled with plot holes.

Summary:  It's not the worst movie I've even seen, but you may want to choose something else.
