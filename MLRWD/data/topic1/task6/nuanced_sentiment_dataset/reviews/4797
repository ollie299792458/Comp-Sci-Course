While this film has its heart in the right place, I'm sorry to say that overall I simply didn't think it was all that good. The cast is comprised of plenty of pretty boys who can't really act, and the script seemed a bit meandering and out-of-focus. Griff and Pete hardly had any time on-screen together, and I thought the heart of the film really should have been all about the two of them trying to work out what they expect from their relationship.

The basic plot of the film really reminded me of a college-age version of the Alex Sanchez book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416909001">The God Box</a>---a few of the details were very similar. However, while I thought the book was extremely moving, the film didn't have much of an emotional affect on me. Well, there were one or two scenes that were rather touching, but really, in general the film was not nearly as emotionally intense as it could have been. This is because of problems with both the script and the acting.

So, overall I'm just going to call this a "pleasant diversion." It isn't a horrible film by any stretch of the imagination, and I admire the story it's trying to tell, but in general this is one of those pictures I'll likely forget about shortly after viewing.

However, perhaps I should caution----your mileage may vary! Because this has gotten a LOT of reviews here on Amazon (which is a bit unusual, in that the majority of gay-themed films don't really receive more than a handful of Amazon reviews)---and the reviews are certainly more positive than negative. So, maybe I should just say that this is worth a watch, if you keep your expectations low.
