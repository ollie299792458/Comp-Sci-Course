With only five episodes to work with for this mini-season of Torchwood, it's pretty much nonstop action and compelling story from the get-go. After the basic setup of Day 1, there is barely time to relax and draw in a breath, as the Torchwood team is busy evading a military force that seems bent on killing them, while trying to find out more information about the 456 and why they are connected to every child on the planet.

This was a very good, exciting story, but I personally think it would have been better if it were not Torchwood. Upon viewing the DVD after watching the episodes on BBC, I found a few too many plot holes, and some characters acting very out of character at times. Some things done just didn't seem consistent to how we had viewed the characters up through season 2. The idea was a good one, but it should have been done as a completely unrelated story...perhaps as an earlier Torchwood team's crisis instead of the Jack, Gwen, and Ianto team.

When all is said and done, this was well-written and action packed, but some bits of this puzzle just seemed a bit forced into place. I would have preferred if Russell T. Davies had just left the show on a longer hiatus, and just started a proper, 13 episode season in 2010.
