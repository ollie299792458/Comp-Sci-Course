This review pertains to the 2004 Collector's Edition DVD transfer and likely the 4-movie DVD bundle too.

Tremors is a great movie, and always a guilty pleasure. It's a small town over-the-top horror with unique scenarios. I previously had a 720p digital file with beautiful picture clarity and vibrancy. Now, I bought the DVD and it is the worst video transfer I've ever seen.

I can't believe they released something this bad. The picture is grainy during all scenes: light or dark, still or motion. There's easily visible compression artifacting and blurriness in everything. Prominent edge ghosting when a dark object is on a light background. There are thick black bars above and below the video stream. When I fullscreen it on my widescreen computer monitor, the video is framed in black on all sides - which I guess is common, but doesn't help things.

To put my review in perspective, I am an audio nut, and normally don't worry much about video. I don't mind watching standard-definition CRT televisions. I don't need a theater experience. But the flaws in this video transfer eclipse my ability to simply enjoy the movie.

Unfortunately, the Blu-ray must be the only version worth owning.
