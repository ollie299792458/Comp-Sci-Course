So, the all too chummy, too politically correct Star Trek: The Next Generation crew finally hit the mark in the motion picture game with this screen adaption of the popular television show.  Here we see Captain Picard finally taking off the kid-gloves instead of taking the pansy and unbelievable every-alien-will-negotiate stand he usually took during the tv series' regular run.  It was also good to see that Picard has his own prejudices(like Kirk vs. the Klingons) and vulnerabilities as the rest of us in our all too non-perfect universe.
The story was somewhat implausible when you consider that the Borg seemed to be going through too much trouble to change the history of a planet that in the universal scheme of things is a infinitesimal part of the galaxy. However, this fact gets lost in the nostalgic storytelling by the Star Trek creators as humans again prove that we are the center of the universe.
As a whole, however, the movie is still great entertainment whether you are a Trekkie or not.  It has enough great special effects and entertaining dialogue to keep your interest throughout the movie and we finally got to see who became our first alien ally at the end of the movie.  Unfortunately, this movie also seems to be the last hurrah in the Star Trek franchise as the next Trek feature, "Insurrection", started to show that the series is finally beginning to lose its appeal to non-traditional Star Trek fans.
