POST-PRODUCTION 3D (converted from 2D to 3D)

My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

There are about 23 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer but 6 of them are very quick. 2 made it to 15% and 5 more at 25%.

The 3D looked somewhat inconsistent from scene to scene and it lacked the crisp details normally associated with animated 3D. This is partly due to originally being a 2D stop-motion film vs. a computer generated animation like most. The lack of colors and the many dark scenes it includes also hampered the 3D.

Active Glasses Users: I detected 19 instances of crosstalk but realistically only 5 times the ghosting was easily noticeable. (on my system)

MY 3D RATING = GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.
