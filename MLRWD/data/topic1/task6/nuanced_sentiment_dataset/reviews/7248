This is a perfect exemple of a time sensitive movie,the material in it has a different impact that it had back in 1988.After First Blood parts 1 and 2,Sylvester Stallone returns for a third time as his famed character John Rambo.This time Stallones takes Rambo to Afghanistan.What is ironic thought is that Rambo is fighting WITH the afghan people wheras today,since since 9/11 they aren`t exactly liked.That is one bad thing about Rambo III,it is out of date and can no longer appeal to modern crowds because of that.Unless you saw it before that but even then it doesn`t feel right to know that an American hero is fighting alongside ennemies.At the time Stallone wanted to show solidarity for the freedom fighters of afghan against the Russian.Add to that the fact that this is very unrealistic and it just lost whatever appeal it had left.It is to note that Stallone looks even more impressive than he did in the second Rambo and was probably at his peak.

John Rabo heads to Afghanistan in order to save his handler Colonel Trautman.At the beggening of the movie we see Rambo fighting in a monastery living a quiet life.He learns the news about Trautman and quickly leaves to rescue him.The storyline is pretty good and captivating but the execution of the plan is somewhat left to be desired.One thing great about the movie is of course the loads of action but also the fight that Trautman fights alongside Rambo in war scenes and shows what he`s capable of,and there was much to expect after all,he was the one who trained Rambo in the first place.It is pretty unrealistic,but in this one it`s gotten pretty bad I have to say.For exemple Rambo drives a tank and fires at the same time,yet the Russians need a full crew just to maneuver the tank funny isn`t it?One thing I hated about the movie is when John gives his necklace,which was the only thing he had left from the Vietnamese girl he meets in First Blood Part II who saved his life to some kid who wants it.It should have been more important to him.There is plenty of action but you can`t mask the fact that it lacks something behind the action.

The special features.The features from previous releases are gone for the most part.The first Rambo had the alternate endings while this one has pretty much nothing.There are trailers for the movie,retrospectives and that`s about it.There are many possibilities for audio and visual which gives way to many options to set the movie to your liking with the metascopes and other modes that let you watch the film in different ways.I wonder why they cutted the extras,they did the same for the Rocky remasters.My advice : if you have the older versions don't get these you won't get anything new.its not worth it.If you cans score one of these "Special Editions" then you might consider yourself to have gotten a great deal.Those "Ultimate Editions" aren't so ultimate after all.

"Rambo III" gets mixed reactions.It does not suit everyone be advised so have to know a minimum on the movie before you actually rent and/or buy it.As mentionned above those editions aren't the best and the older editions are much better.Yet this one is easier to find and ainvailable nearly everywhere DVDs are sold which is pretty much the only advantage with these Ultimate editions.You can also save a lot by buying the "Ultimate Edition" boxed set of the first three Rambo.Overral,a solid sequel definatly worth seeing.Not the best Rambo but plenty of action and entertaiment here.You can't go wrong by picking this up if you are a fan of action movies and/or Sylvester Stalone,I liked both so this definatly worked for me.

NOTE: A few weeks prior to writting this review the fourth Rambo was released,"Rambo",in theatres January 25th 2008
