This film is excellent, not too long and not too short, with the light and mood that would make Emily Bronte proud. Love the casting of Sinead O'Connor as EB herself at the beginning and end! The soundtrack is about the only element that gets to be a bit much - that same series of notes over and over doesn't really do justice to the visuals. Even though Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche are visibly considerably older than the teenaged- to early-twenties Heathcliffe and Catherine of the story, they are very believable. Other presentations of Wuthering Heights have a polished, "sexy" Heathcliffe who just isn't right since Heathcliffe is a monster through and through. Fiennes carries it off beautifully with a barely sublimated savagery showing through every scene, yet remains sympathetic somehow. Binoche's mischievous smirk is perfect for the Cathy who is more succubus than, for instance, Merle Oberon's glamorous princess in the 1939 version. I don't often buy movies to own and repeatedly view, so my shelf of favorites is not large, but this movie is prominent among them.
