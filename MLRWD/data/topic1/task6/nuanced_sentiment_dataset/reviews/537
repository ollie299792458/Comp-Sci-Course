Well, we begin the cycle of main characters departing from the series with Kevin Bacon and Reba.  Earl is on his own this time with annoying newcomer Grady to hunt down the Graboids in New Mexico.  The main thing that brings this down is probably the location.  We loved the town and inhabitants of Perfection, Nevada, but now we're in some place we don't really care about, and Earl and Bert are turned into mercenaries instead of regular guys trying to save their town.  The fact that Bert really gets to show off his knowledge of guns and fighting in this film really brings it back up where it was falling.  As Earl is brought out of his usual character to fight the beasts he fears for money, Bert gets to pretty much use his hobbies for revenge.  There are some very interesting scenes like the truck headlights in the darkness that veer off the road ("maybe he's takin' a leak"), and the Shrieker's introduction.  A very creative film, justifiying the series' cult following by hardcore sci-fi fans.  Not as good, but still worthy.  The birth of CG into the series is another drawback, but it's not too bad.
