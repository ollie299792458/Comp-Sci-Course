"Not Another Teen Movie" has the promise of being as hilarious as "Scary Movie" but it turns out to be just another teen movie. It has the right characters: the self-absorbed jock, the token black guy, the nerdy girl who could look so pretty if it weren't for the darn glasses and ponytail, and the conceited cheerleader. The jock bets he can turn the nerdy girl into prom queen.
The movie consists of replaying various scenes from different teen movies ("She's All That", "Can't Hardly Wait", "American Pie", "Down to You", "Cruel Intentions" to name a few). They take the scenes and charge them up with sexuality, violence, and crude sometimes disgusting humour e.g. human wastes spraying on filmmakers focus on are reinterpreting scenes; there's no thread people. It has the right characters and situations but all the that holds the story together or keeps your interest in the plot. There are a few funny moments but halfway through the movie, I did not care who won for prom queen. I just wanted it to be over.
