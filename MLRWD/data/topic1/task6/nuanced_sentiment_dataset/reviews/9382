I bought this flick after i watched the WILD BUNCH.  I must confess, i am new to Peckinpah as a whole, but DAMN!  this movie starts weird, a pregnant chick gets her finger broken and then the search for Garcia begins.  The two old sadists, tossin an elbow chop to some hooka's mug, start looking for info on garcia. Once they get Billy (warren Oates) on the case, with his girl (she's kinda plain looking but type sexy), the fun begins.  Only Peckinpah could envision Kris Kristofferson as a bike riding rapist.  Oates rocks sunglasses ALL the time, epitomizing "loser" cool.  He's a man looking to make his piece in this unforgiving world.  And he replies in kind, no mercy, no bull$%t.

If you're into rugged films charged with testosterone, pick this up.  It will annoy your girlfriend and parents, easily, while you watch every gritty minute with guilty, smitten glee.  Do it.  You know you want to.

And if you don't, i guess it's because you're late for your ballet lesson, sissies!
