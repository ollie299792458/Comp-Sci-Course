The world did not need this movie. It has no redeeming social value. But if there must be a movie about a would-be Peace Corps idealist who gets swept into the earthy world of a brainless but hunky dance instructor, it might as well be as perfectly executed as this one.

There are the characters.  Robbie the Creep, the self-centered waiter.  Neil the Nerd, who considers himself the catch of the county.  "Baby, sometimes in life we see things we don't want to see."  Johnny Castle, the dance instructor.  "Nobody puts Baby in a corner." And Baby herself.  "I brought a watermelon."  What gems.

There are the different classes of society: the waiters, the rich clients, the low class dirty dancers.

There's the goofy but perfectly constructed plot.  A pregnancy, need a dance fill-in, gotta rehearse so let's get dirty together, sorry daddy I lied, and to top it all off: I was wrong about you Johnny, and thanks for knocking up my daughter.

There's even the pretense of a theme.  Some people are willing to stand up for other people, no matter what it costs them, particularly when their hormones have become involved.

And to top it all off, a climactic dance number that includes every character, every theme, and every element of corn.  Johnny and Baby dance, Johnny goes and gets his dirty dancing chronies, Johnny and chronies dirty dance back to the stage, and everyone dances together.

The perfectly constructed stupid movie.  I watch it every time I can, and find another brilliant detail each time.
