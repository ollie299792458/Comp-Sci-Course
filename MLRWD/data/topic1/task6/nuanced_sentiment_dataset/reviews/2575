This is a hilarious flick.  It was a part of the hysteria over marijuana that afflicted America in the thirties.  Prohibition of alcohol was repealed in 1931 and Prohibition of marijuana was about to be born.  While  this film was NOT financed by the government as many people believe, it did  play right into their hands.  Many had a vested (as in financial) interest  in making marijuana illegal.  Certain corporations that shall remain  nameless had a stake in eliminating industrial hemp.  Creating a mythology  about the evil menace marijuana was a way to achieve that end.  This film  is hilarious due to the poor acting and mediocre special effects.  It is  about the quality you would expect if Barry McCaffrey decided to direct a  film today.  Of course this film is as comical as most of the rhetoric we  still hear today.  The blatant lies about reefer are still spread in some  circles today.  It is sick to admit to gaining such comic pleasure through  misfortune but being in on the lie helps.  It is a funny flick for anyone  interested in drug laws and in use of film to spread propoganda.  It is  hopped up lunacy at its best.
