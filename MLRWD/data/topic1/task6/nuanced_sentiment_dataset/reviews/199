Lets start off with how happy I am this finally after all these years got on DVD.

I remember watching this movie when i was a kid on HBO. i was not more then 8-9 but I remembered it so vividly that when I decided one day to search on Amazon for it, I went insane when I saw that it was there! This movie revolves around the 80's, you guy can probably tell by the cover picture.

Its mainly about a NOT popular girl named Louise Miller who is striving to make it throught school and at the same time crushing over the most popular guy. She went into a fortune telling store and the little lady, Who i have no idea who her name is though, lol she is that lady in poterguist as well. Either way, the fortune teller lady to her that on the night of her 16th birthday, she will have her powers. Louise sorts of thinks the lady was crazy, runs away.

True to the Fortune tellers words, she finds out the hard way.

She starts to believe in her powers and ability and used it for her own benifits. sooner or later, to make herself to become the schools most popular girl and snag the man of her dreams. but then in that process, she might lose her really close friend that has been with her through thick and thin since the beginning of probably grade school, who knows. LOL.

But then later on she realized that her powers she has may be too much for her to handle. will she give it up and go back to who she was, a nobody? or would she learn to use them wisely with the old lady's help and fix the mess that she got herself into?

the only tibit of it was when i bought this from amazon. i bought it for the price of $9.99 and then a few days later, the price changed to $6.99. what a way to take the money!
