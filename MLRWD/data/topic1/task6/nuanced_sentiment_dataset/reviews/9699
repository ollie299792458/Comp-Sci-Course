The 13th Warrior is one of my absolute favorite movies ever, and I just watched again for the probably the 26th time again this weekend and decided that if I like this movie so much that it might be appropriate to explain why. We have a Crichton story and McTiernan directing, two very promising ingredients indeed, and they both deliver on their promise. There are various criticisms of the movie to be seen in some of these reviews and some of them are spot on. Yes, too much was edited out of this movie, far too much sadly, and yes the DVD included no deleted scenes or anything extra except for the cheesy trailer. BUT......c'mon, the musical score is superb, the scenery absolutely breath-taking, the bad guys are interesting, fantastical, and scary, the Viking heroes are complex, interesting, very heroic and culturally accurate (an almost mind-blowing feat for Hollywood), the acting is extraordinarily goood (where the heck did they get the guys who played the Vikings? They're perfectly cast and great actors to boot), the story is exciting, and there is a goose-bump inducing funeral chant I could listen to about 7,000 times and still shiver every time I hear it. Altogether, WOW!!!!!  Yes, I pray that there is a director's cut some day because I would like another hour of character development but what was left of this movie after some savage and unwarranted editing, is still enough to make my all-time favortite, top-ten list of movies and of those on the list I watch this one as regularly as any. Rent this one and watch it and enjoy it for what it does offer, which is extremely good and very intelligent film-making.
