This is going to be a biased review but I feel that it needs to be posted. If you have read the manga, do not buy this! See it any other way if you want but don't waste your money. They took a decent story with good characters who had some depth and then watered it down to pure stupidity and tons of panty shots. Don't get me wrong, fan service is ok with me. Like I said the characters have lost their depth, the story does nothing to express the development of them and their feelings and it completely ignores some very important scenes/interactions that advance the lead. Reading the manga got me really looking forward to this because I thought potential was there. What a let down. Like I said, this is really a warning for those who have read the manga. I wish I would have noticed the one other review with one star by another person stating the same. But I missed it so now I am adding another one star review to hopefully help someone else from wasting their money. Now, if I try to think about this as a person who had not read the manga.... I still kinda think that it's meh probably three stars at best. There are better ecchi harem comedies out there in my opinion. The voicing for the characters felt off to me, the animation was good but sometimes I felt the background was weak. Music was decent. Like I said 3 stars at best. I still think that it deserves a view but don't think a purchase.
