Ever since I went to the first Shrek movie I've loved it. The second installment of this franchise, in my opinion, topped that of the first with more laughter and crazier plots then before.

So when I went to the cinema to see this third installment I was actually a little dissapointed with what I got to see. The movie is by no means a bad one. It's an okay movie but lacks the power that the first two movies had. It all looks better then before, the voice-acting is wicked cool, yet again and there are some really funny bits in there.

So why didn't it catch my attention better? I honestly couldn't say why, the only thing I can think of is that this movie gives a little feeling of a been there, done that vibe.

All I can say to people who haven't seen this one yet, if you liked the first two movies then you can appreciate this one as well. I've ordered this title on HD-DVD because I actually think it's worth the purchase and an other great reason is that kids will enjoy it to the fullest extent. This movie will look extremely good on HD-DVD and I hope this small review hasn't stopped you from getting this disc.
