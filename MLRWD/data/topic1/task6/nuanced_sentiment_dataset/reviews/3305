The writers need to do a little more study on ofshore platform construction and shark behavior.  It seems like they bought a book "Sharks for Dummies" and "Offshore Platform Architecture for  Dummies" because the script has actors citing some unusually  insightful ideas, yet ignoring other obvious ones.
First of all, sharks  cannot bite through steel.  That's an urban myth.  As for breaking through  a wrought-iron fencing, yes easily possible.  But with major injury to a  shark, whose soft body would grate like swiss-cheese against any kind of  metal.  Electrocutin a shark, oh please, do the writers not know anything  about electricity?  
I also like how the sharks get stupid, then smart,  then stupid again, and smart again.  
The action scenes have obvious  CG-artifacts, but it's still a step forward from Jaws (even though Jaws is  still *the* underwater terror film.)  
I could go on and on, but to  summarize, the plot is stupid.  The movie is worth watching if you want  1:40min of mindless fun, because it is fun watching the stupid characters  getting killed off.
