After reading some of these reviews, it's pretty safe to say that some have read too much into "Soul Plane." I don't think it was ever meant to be the kind of film to make everyone happy. Nor was it a film made to meet the (unrealistic) expectations people have.

Granted, I had heard all of the buzz about the negative stereotypes in the film when it came out in May 2004, but I was curious so I went to see it anyway. I also bought the DVD from the used table last week because I wanted to add it to my collection. I found it hilarious overall after I saw it without making judgments. You can tell alone from the cast of comedians, rappers and other actors that have appeared in other comedy films by and for black people that this movie wasn't Oscars material.

This movie is silly. Some parts will make you laugh out loud. Some parts will make you shake your head or cringe. Some will make you really wonder what people were thinking when they made this film (and if you wonder, the DVD has a behind-the-scenes feature). But it's "no-brainer" entertainment and that's all it is.

I don't think "Soul Plane" makes any apologies for what it is or what it isn't. It's pretty obvious from the movie trailer as well as the cover art that it's not your clean-fun film. It's not an Affirmative Action poster and it's not a documentary on racial harmony or casting people in a positive light, whether black or white.

I, too, am tired of the negative stereotypes of black people in America, but I also am tired of moviegoers who know from jump what a movie isn't, but see it and expect it to be that way anyway. I'm tired of people who don't learn to laugh at life. Some of this stuff is funny and if you don't find it funny or amusing, then don't watch the movie. It's very simple.

Take "Soul Plane" for what it is and make a decision to see it --or not. Just don't come in with unrealistic expectations only to whine about it later.
