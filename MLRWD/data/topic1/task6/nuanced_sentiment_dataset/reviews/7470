I love The Hangover. It's my favorite comedy of 2009, so I'm not going to give it anything less than 5 stars, but I just wanted to leave some words of warning to anyone who is interested in the "added value" of a digital copy. Beware that new Hangover blu-rays no longer come with a Digital Copy. I ordered my copy in January 2010 and when it showed up at my door, I discovered that it no longer contained a Digital Copy disc like I've seen in stores and even on Amazon when I initially ordered it. I think studios are gutting digital copies out of blu-rays shortly after they get a bill for all the iTunes downloads they aren't getting paid for.

I thought it was ridiculous when I read that every digital copy code has an expiration date less than a year after it's released. Sure enough I start looking at the fine print on all my blus with digital copies and they all have these expiration dates on them! So if you don't buy the blu-ray right when it comes out and use your code right away, the digital copy is worthless. I discovered this when I bought the Matrix box set a year after it had been out and couldn't access the digital copy because it was expired. Now it seems the new trend is to just take the digital copy out of the box just a few months after release, especially if it sells well, and hope no one notices. The "added value" of the digital copy is a sham.
