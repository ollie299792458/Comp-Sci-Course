I don't know why so many are blown away by this film. I am a huge Jonathan Rhys Meyers fan, but even he can't save the HORRIBLE wanna be glitter rock songs they polluted this thing with. The lyrics are ludicrous in some places. I was actually laughing at them in some scenes. And I don't know where they got the stupid idea that all those artists were flaming fairies?? David Bowie, who's been happily married twice, said that he lied about sleeping with guys. It was just a ploy to shock people & sell his androgenous image. The only person I can think of that was gay was Elton John & he sure didn't write any gay songs back then.

I was around during those days & they may have got the costumes right, but the artists sure had more class than these fictional bozos & a LOT more talent.
Also, these characters are so shallow & one-dimensional that I could care less whether they lived or died. No, I wasn't that thrilled seeing Ewan's "thing" flopping around on stage either.

Mr. Haynes, the next time you do a musical, hire a PRO to write the lyrics.
