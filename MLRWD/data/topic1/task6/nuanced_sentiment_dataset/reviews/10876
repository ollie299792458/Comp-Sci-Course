The acting was cheesy at times...this was one of Melissa Joan Hart's worst movies. I guess she needed the money?

The plot, I admit, was intriguing until the end. I found myself trying to figure it out along with the characters. 9 people, supposedly strangers to each other, are kidnapped and find themselves tied up and blindfoled in a locked room in a warehouse. The killer enters and tells them they have to figure out why they're here or else someone will die every 10 minutes.

*SPOILER* I felt so sorry for Mrs. Chang or Chan? when she got killed by the masked killer. She didn't know how to speak English and she seemed so lost and confused, I felt really bad for her!

*SPOILER* The ending was the lamest ending I've ever seen. You don't know whether Melissa got caught or ran away. It just ENDS, without rhyme or reason. To be honest, I only watched this movie BECAUSE of the ending, I saw so many reviews about it.

The plot was a stretch, I think. I think it was just coinicdence that all of them knew and were connected to each other in that way. In real life, that could never happen. I guess that's why it's called a movie.

The movie wasn't really scary and there wasn't that much blood. Just more suspensful than anything. Might be ok to watch if you're bored.
