I liked the comedic premise of this movie: male best friend who yearns to be more gets drunk and makes the 'switch' to become his female best friend's sperm donor, without her knowing about it. Years later when he meets her kid and puts the drunken night's puzzle pieces together he knows he must tell his friend before she decides to spend her life with another man.

What works in this film for me is Jason Bateman's portrayal of the BFF.  No one is good enough for him because he knows who he wants, but is afraid to say so and risk losing the friendship.  His comedic timing is good and he makes it believable.  His exchanges with his boss, played by Jeff Goldblume, are great.  He also works really well with the boy(s) who play the son. Without these good points, the movie wouldn't be a 'like' for me.

What doesn't work is the tempo of the movie and Jennifer Aniston's performance. The tempo seemed to be OK initially, but then tended to drag.  It picked up with some laughs and then again, dragged. As for Aniston, I like her, but I find that one movie role seems to be pretty much like the next as far as her acting range - it's very limited.  I wanted to be but wasn't sold on her desire to get pregnant, her affection for anyone around her, and even less sold in scenes where she was 'mothering'.  For me, her performance was sort of like watching someone paint a wall white.  Nothing bad, just nothing interesting.  A 'C-' performance overall for her.

It's a pleasant, but not noteworthy movie.  If you want a milk-toast drama/comedy and like the actors, give it a look, but keep your expectations low.
