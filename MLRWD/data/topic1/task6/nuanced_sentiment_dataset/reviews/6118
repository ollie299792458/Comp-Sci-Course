Powerful, cinematic storytelling...

This classic work was a labor of love in the making; and it shows from top to bottom; from screenplay to direction. Historically, it paints Native Americans in a very humanistic manner, including having a healthy dose of humor, which I can attest to from many personal acquaintances.

I originally saw this in 70mm, and would plop down a hundred bills to see it again in that format; one of my all-time fav movie experiences. The DVD version holds up well, and there is always something new to catch with each successive viewing.

It's funny to read negative reviews which are obviously grounded in either racism or ignorance of true American History, or both. Do the math, read some real history, and you'll find that this era was not exactly the highpoint of Anglo-Saxon compassion. I don't see this as being biased at all; there were some good whites who interacted with NAs; but they were a gross minority. If you're white, as I am, get over it already.

All in all, a superior film about a superior culture.
