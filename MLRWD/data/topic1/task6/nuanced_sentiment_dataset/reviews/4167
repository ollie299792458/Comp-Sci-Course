I was excited by the possibility of a new scary movie to watch. But like many others, I prefer reading the book first. The novel, by Scott Smith, was pretty good (I didn't like the ending, but I could hardly put it down until I had finished the last page). As soon as I finished the book, I watched the movie, not expecting too much, but more than what I got.
When the credits started rolling at the end of the movie, I was left wondering if the one who wrote the script had actually read the book. I was surprised that Scott Smith could ever approve such a horrible screenplay. In the movie, things happen to the wrong characters. For example: let's say one of the guys tripped and broke his arm. In the movie, one of the girls would've fallen of a plane and smashed her skull. There we go.
If I could have, I wouldn't have even given this movie one star.
Do NOT waste your time with this trash that isn't even worthy of the $5 bin at wal-mart.

If you're looking for something scary, though, I would recommend:
