My family got a Labrador just before this movie came out.  Our Labrador looks and acts just like Marley.  It was great to see that we are "not alone" with all the problems in raising a Labrador. We laughed at the funny scenes and we loved the way the movie (which is based on a true story) moved so smoothly into the real changes this family went into as they and the dog aged, and to the final end that I admit had me in tears for days.  This is a great slice of life movie.  It has funny, it has conflict and it has sadness, but it can't be trapped in one label such as "comedy" or "reality".. it is truly just a story of a family and all the emotions that go with that! I don't understand anyone saying they didn't like the acting.. this was the among best acting these two have done and they were very believable in their roles and as a team. If you watch this, realize that it isn't written as a comedy.  It was written by a guy who bought a dog and it follows how this fantastic challenging dog changed his life and the life of his family forever.
