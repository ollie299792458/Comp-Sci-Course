Understand that Origin: Spirits of the Past was NOT a bad movie, but it wasn't a great one either. This anime movie has an amazing concept when it comes to the storyline (i.e. the opening sequence, the idea of plants taking over, interesting future concept), but its execution wasn't great.  For example, the climactic scenes aren't all that climactic and the story has so many loose ends. You don't really see much of the military city's "power", the forest druids that are supposed to be the guardians of the forest don't show up much either, and the supporting characters have little to no purpose. Recycled themes aren't necessarily a bad thing, because if they were done well enough, it wouldn't make much of a difference how many times the themes were used.  So, I have to stand up for Origin there because this seems to be the main reason that this movie gets a bad rap.

You really don't get a good sense of who the characters are and they don't really connect to each other.  They seem to lack polish: the youth are average youth, the adults are average adults, but there's no sort of individuality that makes you remember them. Most of all, they lack emotion. The character design and voice acting was average, though. However, the art and environments were top-notch! The beautiful environment really gives you that sense of depth and adventure, redeeming this movie from mediocrity.  Compared to the other material that has come from GONZO (Trinity Blood, Samurai 7, Blue Submarine No.6, Chrono Crusade, Desert Punk), Origin isn't as good. It's a pity, because Origin had SO much potential. I wouldn't recommend buying it, but watch it firs t and see if you think it's worth purchasing.
