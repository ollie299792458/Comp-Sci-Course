Field of Dreams is a movie that vibrates the heartstrings of millions of people, and this version with all of its extras is wonderful. It is hard to believe that it is not among The American Film Institute's 100 Best of All Time. I believe that it is more about the American philosopy of Transcendentalism than it is about baseball. It perfectly illustrates Henry David Thoreau's belief that we should march to the beat of our own drummer. It completely illustrates the Transcendentalist belief in living close to nature. After all, Ray began to hear his inner voice once he moved to the farm. I believe baseball symbolizes the Transcendentalist concept of Oversoul in the movie. Emerson and Thoreau believed that everything is connected to Oversoul; in the movie, everything is connected to baseball. In terms of the transcendentalists' reliance on intuition, what movie better shows its importance? Once Ray began to rely on his intuition, his life finally led to his reconciliation and healing with his father. The transcendentalists also believed in social responsibility. How wonderfully is this illustrated in the movie when Annie staunchly defended the 1st Amendenment at the school board meeting. Director Phil Alden Robinson created a classic movie because it taps into our true American psyche. It is perhaps the most spiritual of all secular movies. A gem.
