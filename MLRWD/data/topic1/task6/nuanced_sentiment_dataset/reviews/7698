This is a factual account of just some of the historical terrorism that Black people faced during and after The Trans Atlantic Slave Trade and its aftermath, Racism white-Supremacy, which has extended itself world wide. Although, the producers  and writers, tried to down play its aftermath and the long term effects this terrorism has had upon those to whom this terrrorism was inflicted and perpetrated ; as well as its effects upon Black people even today (2010). There was no real mention of The Separate But Equal case of Plessy v. Fergerson and its Jim Crow Effect. Nor did they mention how this played upon Racist fears and propagated a mindset of Caucasian superiority. There was no mention of how this played itself out; in the negative portrayls of Black people in The Print Media , radio, television, Hollywood, music videos produced today, etc. and in all facets of life for Black people in the united States. It contributes to the way Caucasians see and treat (mistreat) us, even today. "The only form of 'functional' racism that exists among people of the known universe is white-Supremacy."--Neely Fuller
