It's not just that this is slow-- some of the greatest films of all time (Dreyer, Bresson, Ozu) are extremely deliberate in their pacing, the better to concentrate the viewer on minute details and tiny tremors of feeling.  
It's that it's slow and doesn't deliver much to deserve the concentration required.  There's just not much here to justify the running time.  The improvised conversations are only moderately interesting (and that's assuming you survive the first major one, with the soldier, which is virtually content-free).  The characters are close to being ciphers; I could live with not knowing why Mr. Badii's doing what he's doing, but he hardly says anything personal about anything ("I enjoyed my time in the army" is about as deep as we get).  The shots of roads are not much more artful than random shooting out of a car window with a video camera (at least Antonioni's or Tarkovsky's films are exquisite even when maddeningly empty).  The message is basically the same as the one in American Beauty (life is wonderful because of some quotidian detail of day to day existence).  This is a fairly large bag to hold such a small thought, and it's got a lot of room to bounce around in undisturbed by any others.  
Compare to another recent Criterion release, Dreyer's Day of Wrath, and you'll see the difference between a filmmaker at peak intensity during every second of a slowly-paced film, and one merely mistaking tedium for significance.
