If you are a fan of the Final Fantasy titles from the Playstation 1 days, you're going to watch this sometime. If you felt confused and empty about FFVII's ending, you are defintely going to watch this.
The best CGI made movie I have ever seen. It is great to see these characters that you used to level up, equip, and actually gave a damn about be revamped from the deformed pixle polygons that kept you busy for many hours into very life like CGI. My favorite scene and also one that I always wanted to see, was Cloud vs Sephiroth. "Oh %&$#!" was the only thing I could say as I stared at my two favorite characters duke it out once again. Some of my friends thought the flying around bit was kinda cheesey. I just simply said, they're at maxed out levels. (insert haha)
But, that's when the story and plot come in. It... kinda sucked, and made not much sense. If they worked on it to be a satisfactory plot, it probably would end up as a 4 hour movie,...or another game. This did have a better ending than FFVII's original one though.

The big bonus I thought about this dvd, was the FFVII story recolection feature. It sort of helps people new to this game understand it, but not really. Hoever, I loved it because of the memorable recap.
