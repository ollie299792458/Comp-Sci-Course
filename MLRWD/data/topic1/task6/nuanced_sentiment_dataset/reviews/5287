One of the reasons Alister Sim and Albert Finney work so well as Scrooge is that you are able to witness a transformation of a person throughout their lives.  This truncated version does little to convey the whole story.  It is also a horrible transfer and the original print has faded to dull tones of grey.
It is interesting to see the censorship laws at various times throughout our cinematic history in the choices made when producing "A Christmas Carol."  The Patrick Stewart version is perhaps the best-filmed version but the heavy-handed script writing destroys the illusion of 19th Century England.  Stewart's one-man stage play is a much better version by far.
Seymour Hicks is very good at being nasty but that's not what Scrooge is about.  Scrooge is a guy who has had a tough life and he chose to value money above people to get through the day.  Hicks can never seem to rise above the nastiness.  He is never subtle like Finney or giddy like Sim, he's always just there.
For a completest, you should get this DVD; other folks should enjoy Albert Finney's musical version and Alistar Sim's B&amp;W triumph.
