Barfly is one of my favorite movies of all time. If you want to witness a gritty, honest portrayal of a good man's life rent Barfly. Henry Chinaski is like you or me but Henry is an alcoholic who, by choice or not, chooses to live his life drink to drink. He makes no excuses for his lifestyle and as he asks Jim the Bartendar, "Who made up this rule that we all have to do something, we all have to be something, like a guider pilot or a Narc? Sometimes I get tired of all the things I don't want to do, all the things I don't want to be." Pure Genious!!! If we are honest with ourselves, haven't we all asked ourselves this very same question? Henry meets his match in Wanda and together they persevere in a hopeless world where the only thing that keeps them going is that search for their next drink and their next drunk. Some people who watch this film might view Henry as a bum, but I tend to disagree. As Jim the Bartendar tells Lily the Barfly, "He's as right as any of us." I've seen this movie many many times and each time I see something new and magical. Henry is an almost "Buddah" like character who just accepts his lot in life and lives day to day, drink to drink. He isn't vicious or cruel, rather a kind hearted man who simply does not fit into "societies" rules of success. Henry is true to himself and the life he has chosen for himself, and agree with his choices or not, how many of us can say that of our own lives? Watch Barfly and while viewing it, don't judge Henry but accept him and maybe you'll make a friend in the process.
