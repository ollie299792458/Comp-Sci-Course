Here was an opportunity to excel over not only the original version of the movie but the book itself.
This unfortunately did not happen.  Instead of having a man of mystery with access to great wealth we have a supposedly  very smart yet bored billionaire who decides to engineer a spectacular  heist.  Nothing is presented about him that supports his ability to carry  off this heist other than the heist itself.  However, he is presented in  sight-bites that show a total disregard for the value of money.
For an  atagonist we get an equally over-bearing performance of a sharp, tough,  sexy, self-aware, self-indulgent, (indulgence is key in this film) female  insurance investigator.
The police are portrayed as dim-witted, inept,  powerless, even within their own precinct houses.
The author of the theft  is identified by the investigator and police early in the film.  Then a  dull and contrived attempt at 'who is smarter' is run through.  The  requesite nude scenes, typical of poor plot lines and weak stories, are  presented, almost as often as any real activity that occurs in the  film.
Although films are a means of escape and that varying degrees of  fantasy and departures from reality are expected, this one goes over the  top.
Brosnan was amusing as Remington Steele, but dull and wooden  here.
Denis Leary was surprisngly constrained, obviously to showcase the  supposed stars of the film.
If you can handle the clothes and language  that is typical of period pieces, the original with Steve McQueen and Faye  Dunaway provides better value.
