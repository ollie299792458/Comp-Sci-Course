This group of movies if terrific from the start of Scream 1 and until the end of Scream 3. No matter how gay and corny you think it is, try watching it late at night alone, I can tell you, it will give you the creeps. It's awesome, fun, and scary all together and I highly reccomend it.

It begins with an inasant phone call turned deadly, resulting in murder. Throughout each movie, it's not only scares and murders but a really deadly and creepy story behind the murders. Everything about the series is perfect.

Scream 1 - 5 stars

The most entertaining Scream of all. It includes an absolutely amazing opening and throughout the entire movie it is completely entertaining. The movie keeps you wondering who the killer is and you will not know up until the end. It's totally 90's and the cast brings teriffic acting, the writers bring an amazing plot, and the director brings you a wonderful and entertaining movie.

Scream 2 - 5 stars

It's a tid bit weaker than the first, although I used to enjoy this one best. It brings you yet another wonderful opening and yet another great cast and some more great scares. Like the first, this keeps you wondering about the killer and interested in each thing that happens and each word that is being said.

Scream 3 - 4 stars

This adds something fresh and nice to the series. Probably the honest reason I don't like it the best is because the cast has grown up and went seperate ways. That is the way it would have been in reality, so I guess that is actually a strong part of the movie. There are some new cast members, but most of the original cast is still here and once again, bringing some great acting. The story is fresh and the ending keeps you glued to the edge of your seat until the credits role. No one could ahve made anything better than what it is.

I would really reccomend this to you because it's a great series, everyone should watch it: kids, teenagers, and adults. These movies are a total scream!
