This one of the most delightful movies I've ever seen. The quest story is as old as mankind but here it is told in such a captivating and charming manner that this film remains in a class of its own. You'll find a spectacular array of appealing & revolting creatures and marvelous twists in the plot. One of my favorite scenes is where the two Gelflings fall over a cliff; as the boy panics, the girl spreads her wings, the boy says: "But I don't have wings" to which the girl replies: "Of course not - you're a boy."

The fact is that all the species come across as very real and believable - from the kindly and wise Mystics to the human Podlings to the frightening and hideous Skeksis. The meal scene in the Skeksis castle is particularly vivid and memorable, particularly when dessert is served, although it's not for the squeamish. The visit to the lair of the witch Ogra is also quite humorous and spectacular, and I loved the little doggie, if it is a dog.

This is in the class of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings</a> - The Motion Picture Trilogy exactly 20 years before the latter was made, although it's probably not fair to compare the two. For one thing, Dark Crystal convinces with its world of believable puppets, which adds a unique flavor to the film. I cannot fault this little gem on any aspect: the old myth is infused by new life here because of the marvelous turns in the plot, the scenes are so colorful you cannot forget them, the characterization is of the highest caliber, and the cinematography is breathtaking.
