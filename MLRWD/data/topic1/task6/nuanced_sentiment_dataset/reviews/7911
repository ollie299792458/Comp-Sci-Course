THE PASSENGER is Michelangelo Antonioni's philosophical, yet amazingly entertaining (even adventurous) study of a man's journey in search for individuality and identity in a world of collective artificiality and mime-like existence.
The silently moving camera on this colorful, many-faceted  journey turns out to be just as mesmerizing as is Jack Nicholson's quietly forceful performance.
The anamorphic widescreen DVD presentation of THE PASSENGER is a joy to the eyes and ears. The images are sharp and clean with true-to-life colors; the sound clear, strong and stable, digitally remastered in high definition.
Without hesitation, add this extraordinary 1975 film, which was rather underappreciated on its initial release, to your DVD collection. Study and appreciate this deeply felt existential journey now. And who could really forget that journey's visually dramatic conclusion, with the quietly moving subjective-objective camera having its grandest moments?! What a magnificent movie experience!
Here are my 5 stars to finally welcome the THE PASSENGER to DVD in such beautiful shape, together with Nicholson's commendable and erudite audio commentary as one of the best extras to grace any disc.
