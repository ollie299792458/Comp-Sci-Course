I love the short 13 episode series format - but was disappointed with how they can have a short series here, and STILL waste a lot of time with weak filler material. This could have been an interesting show that could have resolved nicely in 13 episodes. Instead we get filler material like beauty contest episodes & the like. The main character is basically a brain dead wimp throughout the series, just going with whatever stupid thing happens to him, never questioning anything. I mean seriously, he transforms into a woman, and just accpets it all, never even trieds to investigate what is going on here. By the time they get back to any plot or action, it is too late to develop it into anything interesting - because they used up too much time with a bunch of episodes on really dumb stuff. This show has a lot of fan service, and I have no complaints about fan service in anime if there is something interesting going on besides that. But when it is filler due to unsinspired writing, it seems to me they are hoping fan serevice alone will keep people watching. Sorry, but that isn't enough to keep my interest. I am not 15 anymore.
