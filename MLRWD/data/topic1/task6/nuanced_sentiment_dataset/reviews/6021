Is it possible for a romantic comedy to kill the mood? Before watching "Happy Accidents" I'd probably say no. But this movie bolds, italicises, and underlines that YES, such a thing is possible.

First, nothing against Vincent D'Onofrio, but the guy is NOT handsome in this. His unkempt appearance and disturbing mannerisms makes him come across as incredibly skeevy. I get that someone who might be from the future would be a little off, but isn't a romantic lead supposed to be someone you cheer for? If I saw Sam coming towards me, I'd illegally jaywalk across the street to run away on the opposite sidewalk. He doesn't even have one ounce of charm that might make up for his first, second, third, and ninth impression. I haven't seen D'Onofrio in anything else, but I hope for the sake of his career, his roles are infinitely better than Sam.

Then we get to Marisa Tomei. I have no respect for her Ruby character. She's as crazy as Sam is supposed to come off, though for very different reasons. Again - completely unrootable.

I don't think there's one agreeable person in this movie. Marvin the dog might have given me the only smiles during the entire 110 minutes. This movie needed more Marvin.

Also, there is one particular scene that caused me incredible second-hand embarrassment. It was so bad. I don't know what was worse, the acting or the writing. I still have no words for those 5 minutes of horror. [Gawd, was it only 5? It felt like 25.]

I feel like I need to sanitize my TV in order for future romantic comedies to be enjoyed. This movie left that bad a residue.

The ONLY thing that would make this movie not suck is if the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" guys were on the corner of my screen.

So yes, 1 star for this steaming pile.
