I love this movie! I remember watching this movie since I was a kid. You might ask me why I gave this only three stars? It's because when it finaly arrived at my house, I got a cheep version of this dvd. I was disappointed when Disney Studios took the Platinum Edition dvd of Lady and the Tramp out of print and in to the vault. But I found out that the dvd was being sold here on Amazon, and I was thrilled when I bought it. I waited two weeks for the dvd to come until it finally came. I was happy it came, but when I opened the box, I found out that it was obviously a fake! I looked at the comparisons between the dvd covers, and the colors didn't match at all. Also, the words on the back of it looked all messed up and weird. Even the two dvds inside didn't look right; the colors on the top of the first disk were all funky to. I got even more pissed off when I watch the movie itself, and the movie looked like as if I was watching the movie on a VHS tape. The only good thing about the dvd was the bonus disc, which did have the bonus features, and they had good picture quality as well.

It's not the dvds fault, but it is Amazon's and the seller's fault. The seller must have been (and I'm not trying to be racist, but if I am, I am deeply sorry) someone from the middle east. The dvd looked like as if the dvd cover, companion booklet, and the disks were poorly printed out by the seller. Excuse me for my language, but I think it's BULL! Thankfully, I bough the new dvd version of Lady and the Tramp On March 23. I would have got the Blu-ray version, but I don't have that much money to afford a Blu-ray player and Blu-ray dvds. I gonna try and contact the seller and try and get a refund, or at least a replacement to get the real dvd set. Hopfully it will happen and I might get the real dvd set. I love Lady and the Tramp, and hopefully I'll get a decent dvd of this wonderful movie!
