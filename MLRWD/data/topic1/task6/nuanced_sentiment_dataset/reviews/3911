These comments apply to the Congress Entertainment DVD release from Lakeland Sales (who has not responded to my comments).

The good news about this DVD is that it exists, and is reasonably playable. The bad news is that the DVD has the production values you might expect from a garage or backroom operation.

Playability - Both high contrast and overall darkness require adjusting brightness/contrast for reasonable viewing. Audio level is high.

Production values - The disc itself is an inkjet-printable DVD-R, printed only with the movie title and a DVD logo. The clamshell case artwork is very blurry, printed crooked, and appears to be copied from a VHS slipcover - with many generations of copy from the original.

This is all unfortunate, as the story itself is very interesting, and well acted. I saw it not very long after its original release and enjoyed it then, and still do.  However, given the unfortunate (historically accurate) name of Wing Commander Gibson's dog, which reflects British vernacular of the period, it is unlikely that it will be re-released by a more professional source.

Given the very high regard the British have for Wing Commander Gibson, who was awarded Britain's highest military honor (Victoria Cross) for this raid and died in action just over a year later, I'm sure that - in 1954 - they were being very careful about accuracy.
