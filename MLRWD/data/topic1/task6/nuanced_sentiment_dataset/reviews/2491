One of the worst series seasons ever televised . They should have changed the series name to We Are Disrespecting Our Audience .
Randy ? Really ? What were they thinking ? He had absolutely no chemistry with the cast . It was as though they dropped a bad
lounge comic in the middle of a sitcom .Hyde and the stripper ? I couldn ' t buy the premise or the actress . Hyde wasn ' t the
type to go to Las Vegas or marry a stripper . And if you are going to do a Vegas stripper , get someone believable.
Jackie and Fez , no way , now we 've really gone off the reservation . True science fiction .
Red liking Randy , wasn 't at all believable knowing Red 's behavior over the previous 7 seasons .
The writer 's or producer 's pulled it together for the series finale by setting it at the turn of the decade , but more importantly
the return of Eric . Even though his reunion with Donna was only a couple of minutes I have to believe they were again a couple .
The final circle with New Year ' s Eve countdown was perfect .
Overall , I think on average the first 7 seasons were by far light years ahead of the 8th season . I do believe in general the series
was sloppy at times , too many Red butt jokes , too many Kelso is dumb bits . We got that by the end of the first episode or two .
It was a very good series but could have been better .
