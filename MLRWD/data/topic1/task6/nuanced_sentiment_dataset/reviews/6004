PONTYPOOL is by far one of the most excellent "zombie" films in the history of cinema.  When one considers the fact that some who worked on the film did not consider it to be a "zombie" film, it serves to outline the reasons the film works so well.  The "happenings" that occur in the small town of Pontypool can be seen in many different ways.  Certainly, the strangeness of the movie make the situational horror manifest itself within the confines of several interpretations.  The "bad" guys can be seen as zombies, insane, victims, etc.  What makes the movie so incredible is the Oscar worthy acting by Stephen McHattie.  McHattie's portrayal of Grant Mazzy is dizzying.  His performance is by far one of the most outstanding and riveting in any genre.  When this fact is coupled with one of the most intriguing plots in the history of film, the viewer gets a rare recipe for greatness.  PONTYPOOL is a must see for zombie fans, horror fans, and serious film buffs.  It was simply one of the most outstanding films I have seen in a very, very long time.  Do not miss it!
