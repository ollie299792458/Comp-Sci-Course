I liked a lot about this video; for example, I was informed about things, like Petra, that I never knew about. I am a Bible believer; however, one needs to be careful with "prophesy." This video mentions Matthew 24:34 with the assumption that "the vine" or "the fig tree" is Israel, but there is no evidence for that whatsoever.  As a matter of fact, one only has to read to Matthew 24:36 to see that only the Father knows the time. The video doesn't mention the metaphor of the fig tree being Isreal or get into the symbolism at all, just states that the Bible says "this generation shall not pass away" and mentions that this generation is the one that sees the rebuilding of Israel. Again, there is no evidence for that whatsoever. That is something Hal Lindsey said way back when to defend that the world was going to end in 1988 (40 years after the rebuilding). The video assumes the listener believes that the fig tree is Israel (for which, by the way, there is contradicting symbolism in the Bible), and without that belief, it makes it hard for me to take in the rest of this video. Although, as I stated, I did like a lot about it. Another thing was that I found it difficult to understand the accents of some of the people in the video and subtitles weren't available.
