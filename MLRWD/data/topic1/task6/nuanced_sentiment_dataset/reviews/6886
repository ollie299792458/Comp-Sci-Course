Luc Besson is definitely one of my favorite directors / writers of all time. I mean come on... we're talking the director of films such as The Fifth Element, Nikita (La Femme Nikita), and my personal favorite Leon (The Professional). He has an incredible eye behind the camera, knows how to tell an original story, and a style where you know you're watching something Luc has had his hands in whether it's producing, directing or writing.

Angel-A starts out with the down and out character, Andre (played quite well by Jamel Debbouze) finding himself in debt with a slew of different parties and no way out. In his despair he decides to climb on a bridge and jump off ending his worries and lonely life. However, as he is about to jump he looks over and sees a rather tall, beautiful blonde about to do the same. She jumps from the bridge and Andre jumps into the water to save her. Upon saving her life he finds out that her name is Angela (Angel-A). A series of events occur and we find it is Angela who is actually saving Andre's life. We also come to find that Angela is not your typical woman and "fell from the sky" to save him.

Filmed in black and white and with subtitles this film has some stunning cinematography often associated with Besson's work. The story itself is primarily about loving one's self and ultimately loving others. It's engaging, interesting and a beautiful tale. Highly recommended if you're a fan of Besson's work.
