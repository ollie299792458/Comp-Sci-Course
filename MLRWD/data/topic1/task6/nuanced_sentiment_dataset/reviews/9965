The movie, "The President's Analyst", is a quirky little comedy from 1967 that was only a minor hit at the time.  It stars James Coburn from the era of his success as Derek Flint, the suave American counterpart to James Bond.  But, sadly, Coburn's spy movies overshadowed this film and prevented it from being seen as an excellent commentary on the times, the American culture and the business world.  Woven through this tale of a psychiatrist who is recruited to be on call for the President of the United States during stressful times are fascinating snapshot views of the 1960s.  The comedy is enriched, not distracted, by subplots about the relationship of our intelligence community with that of Russia, about gun ownership in a way that would foreshadow many NRA issues, about the drug culture, the music culture, growing dependence on computerization and finally, the use of "the phone company" as a representation of big business in America.  This hilarious movie is deeper than you might imagine, and Coburn is a master at not taking himself seriously while presenting some serious messages.  I highly recommend this!
