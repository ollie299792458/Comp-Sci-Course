This, for me, was yet another miss and I wasn't really feeling it but my mother got it and I figured why not watch it; it's late at night and i've seen everything else I have.
I wasn't expecting much except that my girls Jennifer Lewis and Angela Bassett were in it. I watched it all the way through, without stopping, and left uninspired. Geez, where do i start?
Well for one thing, What accent was Ms. Bassett going for? It came off different and more uncomfortable every time she opened her mouth but I will give it to her that she has that "fire" that I love in her acting.
The bi-polar spanish woman was completely unnecesarry; if she wasn't in the movie, you wouldn't even notice that's how insignificant she was.
There wasn't a medium in the movie, the characters and the story didn't mesh well for me; you had characters that were too over the top (Leroy Brown) and characters that were too calm. The story went from typical drama to comedy to sorry and sad to melodramatic to happy without any seguing.
I think they threw some of these characters in just to say "we got a little bit of this and that" without any base to them. Was it me or did they just go through Rick's gambling problem in less than 10 minutes?
 Overall, the story was too typical and safe for what I expect. At least "Daddy's Little Girls" had an arc and characters to keep your interest.
Ms. Lewis was on her game, as always and to no surprise and those outtakes were off the hook; "Take the money Anna Mae" LOL. She finally got more of a part in Tyler Perry's movie; that part in Family Reunion was terrible. That's not Jenifer Lewis.
I didn't feel anything for the movie and this was not a suitable successor to "Why did I get married?" which is his best movie thus far. Too many stereotypes and too wild to be relatable for me.
