The original Night of the Living Dead is still a horror masterpeice, and it is presented it wonderful, clear DVD format in this version. The soundtrack was partially remastered, and rather badly. The synth score totally rapes any kind of ancient and spooky atmosphere the original gave.
Now, as for the 30th Aniversary Cut. I'm sure since the release of this horrificly stupid edit that the dead have risen more often just to shatter copies of this edit. Theres 15 minutes of added footage that is absolutely appalingly unnessessary, stupid, trite, badly acted and totally out of place. The music is even WORSE than the original since the score has a drum loop through it, making it sound like a 14 year old's Yanni nightmare.
The score was composed by the man who plays the priest in the extra footage... Personally, I'd've liked to have taken a bite out of his face for his insipid, uninspiring and lame score.
This edition also comes with a Music Score DVD that makes me twitch it's so...damned...bad. The last track is original title redo (from the 1998 cut of the film for DVD) but the one before that is the worst peice of "techno" you could possibly hear. It loops tiny dialouge tracks into a very, very bad dance loop and it makes me want to tie small woodland animals to the back of my car and drag them for several miles, if it would only make this re-mastered score go away.
