Pan's Labyrinth is a true masterwork of fantasy storytelling.  This has the same sprit of "Tideland" and what the film "Mirror mask" should have been. Pan's Labyrinth, like other for-mentioned films, relies on the imagination of a young girl and the innocence of youth and how that innocence can overcome great strife, chaos and misery.  Pan's Labyrinth is brutal without being overly graphic and creepy with making you too uncomfortable.  The creepiest parts are not with the fantasy characters but the scene with the Tyrant Stepfather.

This movie is not "Lord of the Rings" fantasy and really does a lot with very little.  It's a great mesh of a reality period piece set in the 1940's and a fantasy epic with strange creatures. This is the best foreign language film of 2006 and one of the best films you'll see from the last year.  Del Toro created a masterpiece in a heartfelt story about a young girl trying to make since of her world and do what's right for her ailing mother.

The fact that this movie almost didn't get made is amazing in it's self.  Due to productions costs and financial problems that required the director /producer to not only cut out his own salary but invest his own money on top of that to get this project off the ground.  You can see why the director felt so passionately about this film and wanted to see his vision come to fruition.

I loved this film and highly recommend it to anyone
