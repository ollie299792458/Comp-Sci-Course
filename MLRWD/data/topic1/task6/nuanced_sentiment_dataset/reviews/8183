I loved this movie...I know, I know, chinese cliche martial art exploitation film BUT...

John Lee is deliberate in every word and movement. He doesn't say much and it works. It makes him all the more serious and sinister. Next, if you notice carefully, he dresses entirely in grays, blacks and dark neutral tones. It makes him stand out against the world of color in the background, especially in the Chinatown scenes which are explosive with color. Best of all, I was sucked in by the killer with a heart, not just an unstoppable murder machine.

Mira Sorvino is great as the tall, beautiful and ALL tough girl, Meg Coburn. She means business and doesn't take any bull*#@% even when there's a gun pointed at her. ..loved her comment about "we'll have this conversation again".

Finally, what greater villain's lair than the exquisite Hollyhock House by Frank Lloyd Wright. I love the few scenes that show it and strain to get a better look.

I'm know I'm glossing over some other great parts of the movie, but these are the things that truly stand out to me.

All said, I LOVE this movie. Something about it is exciting to me. If it's not your thing, so be it, but it is worth seeing.
