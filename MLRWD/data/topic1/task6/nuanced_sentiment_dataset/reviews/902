It is hard with mere words to describe this movie; suffice it to say that everything you've heard about it is true, and then some. This is one of the baddest of the bad, a masterpiece of utter incompetence, a cinematic failure in every way. It is a guidebook on how NOT to make a movie, tell a story, or act.
It is, in short, a work of genius.
What plot there is involves the last humans on Earth battling the "Ro-man" XJ-2 and his boss, the "Great Guidance" Ro-man, both portrayed by actors in gorilla suits with diving helmets and TV antennae. The Ro-men fight with technical sounding gobbledygook babble and stock footage of dinosaurs, against which the plucky human survivors use a lot of bad philosophizing, hand-wringing, and, for some reason, a wedding. Along the way, XJ-2 becomes consumed with robot lust for the pretty daughter of the scientist despite her lack of body hair, but whether this is the result of the overactive bubble machine at the Ro-man's headquarters is not clear. If this summary makes no sense to you, then you are clearly one of the Hu-mans. If it does make sense, then you are still Hu-man, because in the world of "Robot Monster", such contradictions are 0.7652 higher than our planet. Do you understand?
So buy "Robot Monster". Watch "Robot Monster". Laugh heartily at "Robot Monster". And have a moment of silence at the end, because this movie is so brilliantly bad that it qualifies as a religious experience.
