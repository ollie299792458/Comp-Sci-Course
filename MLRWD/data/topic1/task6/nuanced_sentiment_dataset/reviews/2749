This film has almost the appearance of a documentary of the last days of Hitler and his gang inside the bunker.  Many of he actors who appear in the film even resemble their real-life counterparts.  The realism is enhanced because the film is in German.  Although The Bunker (HBO-1980) with Anthony Hopkins was excellent and Hopkins made a convincing Hitler, Bruno Ganz takes the part to a higher level; you believe you are looking right into Hitler's own eyes.  Traudl Junge, who was one of Hitler's secretaries, is, in essence, the  narrator of the film, and the film is based on her autobiography, Until the Final Hour, which was not published until just a few years before her death.  At the beginning of the film the now elderly Frau Junge describes how she was simply in the right place at the right time when Hitler hired her; she was not an "enthusiastic" Nazi; and she was overtaken more by curiosity than anything else when she applied for the job.  Frau Junge also wonders if she can ever forgive "the child" who went to work for Hitler.  There is a more extensive interview with a much younger Frau Junge in the old documentary series, The World at War, which is a very valuable source in and of itself because it was made while many of the major figures of the war were still alive to be interviewed.
