Okay. This movie could had been a great movie, but what happened was there were too many big name stars than it actual needed. The stars in the movie were Danny Trejo, Steven Seagal, Robert De Niro, Michelle Rodriguez, Jessica Alba, and Lindsay Lohan. They should had just had either Seagal or De Niro for the villain. They should had Michelle Rodriguez or Jessica Alba. Lindsay Lohan as the drug addicted daughter in the movie they didn't actually needed. They could had just had the mom be a addict if needed, but that whole part wasn't needed in the first place.

If they could had did a better planning and editing in this movie, this movie could had been so great. As of now, it is just a if-if movie. But enough about what could had been, this was how the movie was. I thought Trejo played a great Machete. He was a great hero and acted his part well. Seagal acting wasn't as good as Trejo. He didn't play the villain as well. He seemed too cocky and overplayed his role. De Niro was a better villain than Seagal and should had been the main villain without Seagal as a partner. Rodriguez played a great hero role in the movie and was the best actor in the whole movie. Alba was okay, but was just eye candy in the movie. She shouldn't had been in the movie because she seemed misplaced in this movie and wasn't a good actor. Lohan was another eye candy actress in the movie. She too wasn't needed or her role.

If there is another Machete movie, I hope they consider cutting down on the main stars list. Sometimes TOO MUCH is a BAD THING!
