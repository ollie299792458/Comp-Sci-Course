I have been looking high and low for this DVD and I was exhilarated when I found it. I had to have it specially ordered because the store I went to did not have it in stock. And yes, it was worth it. 
To those of you unfamiliar with the plot of Jesus Christ Superstar (JCS), well... that sounds quite implausible, but still... if you have no idea what the story of Jesus Christ is, all you have to do is read the Bible, or head out to watch Passion of the Christ. JCS chronicles the last few days, or perhaps hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life, through the point of view of the betrayer, Judas Iscariot. 
Yes, this is what makes the storyline somewhat distinct from other movies/plays based on the story of Jesus. Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical sees Jesus through the eyes of Judas, and explores Judas's character, while at the same time, helping the audience to speculate why Judas would betray someone he loved so much. 
The cast here is outstanding. Glenn Carter is superb as Jesus, partly because he bears some resemblance to his character. Renee Castle is a great singer, though her voice is a little feeble and is reminiscent of Brandy. Jerome Pradon gets the thumbs-up for his performance as Judas. His interpretation of Judas's character shows us a man who is torn between his love for Jesus and his wisdom. Although Jerome is hardly a great singer, he is an outstanding actor. And his great performance is what makes the film so enjoyable. Rik Mayall is wonderful as King Herod. He has the right mischievous air, coupled with the malice he exudes. 
Indeed, it is the cast that holds this performance together. The musical itself, to me, is hardly as strong as what Andrew Lloyd Webber could have offered. The music has not enough lilts to engross viewers. I would not classify this musical as one of the greatest in the world for this reason. Such a great story deserves a stronger musical score to bring forth its greatness.
