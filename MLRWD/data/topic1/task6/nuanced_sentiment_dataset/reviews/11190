Okay, now I'm one who loves a good story.  Even if the storytelling may be a bit slow, it's all about the message the film is trying to convey to its audience.  But this movie?  This movie is an UNBELIEVABLE borefest.  I kept waiting and waiting for this movie to pick up from its sedated state and it never did.  All that happened was me falling asleep.  About an hour and 20 minutes into the movie I found myself wanting to stop it, but a part of me made me finish watching.  I told myself "something is bound to happen, the ending will be shocking!"  But then once I realized that would never happen, I kept it running because I figured "I've gone through so much, I have to finish this, or else it will all be for nothing."  Nothing about this is shocking.  Even if should be remotely shocking whatsoever, that aspect of it gets lost in the fact that it is so BORING.  Slow movies are great, as long as they have something entertaining in them, or build up to something.  This movie had nothing to offer and one of the most dull climaxes I've ever seen.  I gave it a chance, and Felicia's Journey feels more like a Wisconsin Death Trip.  Avoid, unless you are an insomniac and want to go to sleep.
