The Net is an entertaining thriller based on a genuinely interesting plot idea. The technical aspects of the film were fairly comical at the time, on a par with the movies in which crackers need nothing more than type "hack password" in order to break the most advanced security systems. Increased computer literacy probably helps the film appear more unintentionally funny that it was back in the day. The notion that an evil bunch of super-hackers would choose to hide themselves by sticking links to themselves on web pages seems a bit odd, as does the notion that identify theft of this magnitude is possible.

In order to accept the premise that Bullock's character has become an "unknown", we must assume that she has had literally no interaction at all with the outside world - except for her ex-boyfriend, and we're left wondering why she didn't meet at least one of his friends? It also appears that she has not visited a dentist, doctor, bank, grocery shop or anything else in four years.

The plot would have worked better if placed in a futuristic world, since there's just too much implausibility to overcome. Enjoyable thriller for luddites, and a good comedy for the technically-minded.
