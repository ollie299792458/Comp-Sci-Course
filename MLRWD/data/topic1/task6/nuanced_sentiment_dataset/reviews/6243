I wish it were not necessary for me to give this product only one star, but that rating is based on MY EXPERIENCE with MY DOGS.

I believe if you live in a city, especially if you live in a concrete jungle that involves elevators just to take your dog for a walk, that this tape might be absolutely engrossing and entertaining for your dog. I personally (as a human) found some of the music a bit monotonous (and even bombastic), but perhaps the composer, Bradley Joseph, in this case has found his audience in dogs.

Why it didn't work for me - I live in the Great Smoky Mountains, and I guess my dogs are too used to nature sights and sounds. Although my dogs are not allowed to roam at will (they are either in a chain link yard or on a long cable lead), they do see and hear things that probably render this DVD as "natural surroundings", except for the music, which they tune out as they generally tune out everything on the TV except the sounds of human infants crying. Also, we are retired and the dogs are rarely left alone. When we are gone they usually snooze and greet our return with sleep bleary eyes.

The DVD is inexpensive enough to give it a try. If it doesn't work for you, donate it to your library, animal shelter, etc. I'm sure it will find a home where it will work well.
