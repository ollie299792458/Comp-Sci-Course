The Omega Man is not a very good film, but there are scenes of great power, as well scenes of great cheesiness.  Chuck Heston, in slightly toned-down "Planet of the Apes" form, is humankind's savior yet,  as usual with Chuck's film alter-egos, the viewer's reaction to him is, at  best, ambivalent. Nevill has been part and parcel of the destruction of the  human race, is arrogant and reactionary, yet he is also a redeemer and a  man of accelerating conscience.  The movie revolves around his bleak, yet  self-imposed state of existence.  Nevill's mercenary clashes with his  decrepit enemies, much of the dialogue, Nevill's relationship with Lisa (a  neat pairing), and the classic Christ-like final scene are interesting and  speak to larger moral and social issues eloquently (if a bit hammily, at  times), but the film fails to capture the viewer.  There are a number of  dramatic lapses in the movie, the editing is poor, and the  "zombie" enemy is a hackneyed, and, in the end, silly antagonist.  The movie also has the same dingy, low-energy atmosphere that  characterized "Soylent Green".  This atmosphere helps the film at  times, yet also stamps the movie irreversibly as a product of the early  1970s' ambitious yet generally unsuccessful "pessimistic future"  genre of films.  Finally, the score is truly horrendous.  It is funny for a  while, but then begins to really get on the viewer's nerves, and it does  nothing to help in already dull, poorly directed scenes.  In short, the  movie is dated and directed with minimal energy and skill, but it is worth  a look if you want to see a period piece of a jaded time in the  "sci-fi" genre, a fun Chuck Heston performance, and flawed  ambition.
