Night of the living dead is not only a cult classic, but a great film, frightening, suspenseful, intelligent, beautiful because its cheap budget made it rely on subtle mechanisms and strong acting, but 30th ANNIVERSARY EDITION has BUTCHERED that simple brilliance. The edition offers two versions of the film, neither of which are original. One is a 1998 version, mostly identical to the '68 cut, but with a new score by a composer of campy 'horror flick' music. This may be a cheap rip-off of the success the ACCLAIMED composer, philip glass, had with re-scoring the original Dracula with bela lugosi, but the new score for Living Dead does nothing but take away from the film's suspense and beauty. 
The other version is labled as the 30th Anniversary Edition, with NEW, (not original deleted), scenes. They were filmed recenly, with new technology, so the scened don't mesh well, and they have no bearing on the original plot. 
This edition is ostentatious and campy. it is a cheap effort to capitalize on an old success. The effect is a worsened film, no better than the multitudes of B movies that rushed at its heels like so many gold-diggers to a brand new mine. 
DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION OF NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD
