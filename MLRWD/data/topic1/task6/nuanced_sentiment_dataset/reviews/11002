I am a true GB fan.  I will watch him in nearly anything.  This script was written by women, and it expresses a cynical attitude about men, which has some basis in truth!  Men cannot help their sexual view of the world, it is hard wired!  Love them anyway most of the time.  This one is about two very different people, a man who has been unlucky in love, and a woman who is very controlling, and still trying to find the perfect man.  GB's character is eventually attracted to her, but thinks she is out of his league.  You slowly learn GB's raffish character is a pretty nice guy, underneath it all, and not as sure of himself as you might think.

The dance scene is worth the price of admission, and GB actually took dance lessons to do it right although Heigl did not.

They were unable to come up with a satisfactory ending, and filmed two.  I did not like either one though.  One is a wedding, which was never shown, and one is a sex scene, in a dark room, not too satisfactory either.  GB is a very good actor, would like to see him in a better vehicle.

There is a ten minute gag reel of outtakes available online, but if you are easily offended, don't Watch!

A couple of amusing short scenes, such as when GB takes Heigl to the dress shop; watch the red headed sales lady closely.  Good actress, who is amusing without trying hard.  Love those tight shirts on him though!
