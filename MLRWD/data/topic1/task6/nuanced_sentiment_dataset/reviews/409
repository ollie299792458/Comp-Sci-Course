It is hard to believe that if Bela Lugosi would not have been so proud, he would have played 'Frankenstein' back in 1931 and Boris Karloff may never have been 'discovered'.  In this movie he is at his creepy best;  that  unforgettable drawling, lisping, well enunciated voice (how a Mummy from  ancient Egypt got a slight British accent we are best off not to ask),  along with a great make-up job by Jack Pierce, make this one of his best  (of many) bogey-man performances.  The rest of the cast is adequate,  although David Manners, who was the romantic lead in several of these  Universal classic horror films of the early '30s, is about as colorless of  a 'hero' as you could hope for.  A good creative story with elements of  'Dracula' but is largely original.  Features one of the most eerie scenes  in movie history, early in the film (and without background music), where a  bandaged up Boris sloooooowwllly wakes up from a 3700 year nap and greets  poor unsuspecting Bramwell Fletcher rather rudely.....a great example of a  scene that scares without shocking (and one that most of today's  slasher-flick film makers should watch and take notes on!).  Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
