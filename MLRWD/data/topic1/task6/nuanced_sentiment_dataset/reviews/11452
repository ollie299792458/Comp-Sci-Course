I have been lucky enough to have had the opportunity to watch this DVD and all I can say is, don't hesitate!  Order it immediately!
The transfer is beautiful and is almost completely free from film damage or other blemishes.  The blacks are deep and consistent throughout the picture.  A beautiful DVD transfer.
Sound is presented in the film's original monaural track which has been cleaned up due to its age.  There is no hiss or background screech or other noise to detract from your viewing of the movie.
As for extras, Warner's presents the movie in its "Night at the Movies" format which simulates the experience of watching the film circa 1947 theatre style.  That means you get to enjoy period newsreels, comedy shorts, cartoons, etc. before you watch the feature.  Very enjoyable!
Disc 2 of this set features a 2 hour documentary on director John Huston's career, hosted by Robert Mitchum.  The doc features interviews, photos, private film footage and more and is a great tribute to this talented director.  Excellent!
Next is a 50 minute documentary on the making of the film.  There are interviews with the cast and crew as well as film historians that make a great supplement to the film itself.  Great!
There is also a classic Bugs Bunny cartoon, a "Treasure Trove" (tons of production photos, storyboards, publicity materials, etc.), and finally, a 1949 radio version of Treasure of the Sierra Madre performed by Bogart &amp; Walter Huston.
Warner again presents a truly great special edition of one of their classic library films.  Don't be without it!
