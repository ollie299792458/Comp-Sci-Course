Pros:  Some funny moments and the movie truly seems like it is going to be good in the beginning.

Cons: Taking the movie away from the Cops/reality show format really makes it a lot less funny.

The Comedy Central show is funny, but this movie just doesn't deliver in the same way.  Don't get me wrong, there are a few laughs, especially towards the beginning when it really feels like the idea is going to work, but the overall plot is just not as funny as it could be, despite the fairly nice premise of the team showing up to a police convention at which they are not welcome.  The main problem is that the show got a lot of its steam from the Cops-like format which offered comedy in short, hilarious bursts.  This is not to say that it didn't have a plot, but the plot (or plots) were delivered in a rather subtle way which often, in and of itself, helped fuel the comedy by allowing jokes to be brought up again just when you had forgotten them.  The movie tries for a more cohesive storyline, but much of it is just not humorous and the time spent developing story takes away from the type of humor that Reno is good at delivering.  Even the funnier moments are usually present in subplots (such as Clementine trying to find the mystery man in her tattoo) which are paced in a way that is more similar to the show.  The actors all deliver as good a performance as possible based on this script, but this movie really should have stayed more true to its roots.
