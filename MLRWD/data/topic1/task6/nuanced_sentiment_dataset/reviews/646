Have you ever seen a movie which could fit into several categories, but never completely in one?  Part horror, part comedy, part drama, part family movie, part road movie, etc.

This motion picture is in my personal top 20, meaning, I bought a book called "Heaven & Hell To Play With -- The Filming Of Night Of The Hunter" by Preston Neal Jones to read more about it.  The only other book I purchased about a movie was Eric Greene's work about the original Planet Of The Apes.

Robert Mitchum, Shelly Winters, Peter Graves, kid actor Billy Chapin, character actor James Gleason and the great Lillian Gish (from the silent AND talking picture ages) are included in this class of heavy-weight actors which gives the viewer a visual and emotional treat.  Lillian Gish, in particular, uses her face and hands to say so much more than words ever could.

Someone complained about the price of the 2 Blu-ray disc set.  I have to say, if you want to spend that kind of money, do it on this one, The Wizard Of Oz, Gone With The Wind or some other classic.  The special features alone are worth the price.

Thanks to the manager of my local video store who knows what I like and promptly recommended Night Of The Hunter to me when it came out on Blu-ray.
