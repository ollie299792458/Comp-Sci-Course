I'm still scratching my head on this one which came HIGHLY recommended by my sister who shares 99% of my taste. This was the other 1%. Sister ADORED this film. I thought it was a total waste of my time, but find it hard to explain why. Sharp-elbowed, appallingly ambitious, back-stabbing climbers can be the stuff of great comedy - particularly satire; and God knows they exist in spades in elite politics. And I love satire, at which no one excels the Brits. But this movie was not even bad -- it simply bored me to tears. It just fell flat. Not funny. Not even interesting enough to feel it was worth my time.

Clearly there is simply an element of personal taste here because the reviews are so variable. But I also had a big technical problem with the writing. The actors were good. Most unusual, I thought the American acting here even stronger than the British (James Gandolfino was particularly great in a small role I wish had been larger.) But the Brit writers revealed a serious weakness: they used the same voice for both their British and American characters, making them virtually indistinguishable aside from their accents. That rang jarringly false for me. Grasping, ambitious, self-centered, amoral and immoral socio-pathic creeps struggle to climb the political ladder in both the UK and the US (and the rest of the world, too, n'est ce pas?) But they don't interchangeably talk and act like one another in their shared obnoxiousness. Accents aside, the American characters could all have been Brits. This is the equivalent to a writer who cannot write realistically for people of the opposite gender. My sister had told me the satire skewers everyone and that no one comes out looking good - neither the Brits nor the Americans. At least that much we agreed on about this film . . . .

I stayed with it to the end because of my sister's referral. But honestly, if you're not hooked within the first 10 minutes, it doesn't get any better. You might as well then pull the plug.
