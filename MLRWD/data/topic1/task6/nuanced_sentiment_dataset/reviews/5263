While I enjoyed the seemingly non-injurious chase scene on a Miami freeway bridge, and the consequence of the repeated ridiculous decisions to chain a big dog to an above-ground-pool support pole, I did not permit my son to see the remainder of this horribly violent movie.

Gratuitous violence of any kind is a perverse and cruel decision that shows contempt for the sacred right to life and undermines the very foundation of all civil society.  Further, Bad Boys II appears to show contempt for Catholic traditions by comparing a Cuban drug lord to Christ in his moment of ultimate sacrifice.

I would have preferred that the script not feed rising global hatred for the United States by showing a face of complete disrespect for human life and property.

The ends do not justify the means, and we should always respect the United States constitution when portraying United States black-ops, which do not always use such violent and deadly means to rescue hostages.

For example, scriptwriters should look to the TV series ALIAS for an example of how to show a better face for the United States. The script could have shown a successful outcome by shooting persons with tranquillizer darts, especially when in a religious shrine.

The use of high explosives to blow-up a Cuban palace appearing as a religious shrine was disrespectful to Catholics and Christians everywhere.  Did the CIA black-ops volunteers die when the Cuban palace was blown-up?

"If together we can succeed in eliminating from our hearts any trace of rancor, in resisting every form of intolerance and in opposing every manifestation of violence, we will turn back the wave of cruel fanaticism that endangers the lives of so many people," Pope Benedict XVI.

The movie deserves its one star "R" rating.
