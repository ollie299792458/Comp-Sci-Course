You can read other reviews for the movie details; I on the other hand, want to commend the film?s two main characters to you. Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), an over achieving son of a prominent (Jewish) Financier, and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleston), a Rugby hero son of Scottish Presbyterian missionaries.

Both men have many characteristics in common and other characteristics that are quite different. Harold must WIN -- until he raced against future Olympic teammate Eric Liddel he NEVER lost. He is Jewish fighting for respect in the upper English society he is a part of because of his financial status and ability. He hates being judged by his religious heritage and not because of his personal achievements and he WILL prove to one and all that he is a better man than English society says. Eric on the other hand must RUN, because when he does "God made me for a purpose, and he made me fast and when I run I feel His pleasure!"

Both men battle the entrenched English code -- Harold because of the prejudice he endures as a Jew and Eric because he dares to place God over king in his refusal to run for English glory on Sunday.

Do yourself a favor and get this movie -- watch it often!
