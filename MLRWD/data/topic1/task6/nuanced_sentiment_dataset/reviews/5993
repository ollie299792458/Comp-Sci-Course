When this was released in 1981 I was enchanted; through the years I've wanted to watch it over and over, but rarely had the opportunity.  Nostalgia:  star one
The thrill of the battles, the round table, the knights, Camelot, and the magic of Merlin were an aphrodisiac to a mystical creature such as I am.  It was also a very progressive movie for the time.  The scene in the forest as Guinevere and Lancelot lay together in the afterglow of love -- not during -- is (in my opinion) much better than the animalistic approach of today.  I prefer imagination rather than the modern thought that nothing is taboo.  Star two
I watched the recent release, with a great deal more knowledge about the Arthurian legends, but this version did not recapture my fantasies. Details that are well covered in other books and movies are ignored in this one. However the magic and seduction that brought about the births of both Arthur and Mordred are well done. Like father, like son...
The movie is filmed darkly, perhaps to capture the Dark Ages. The foreboding darkness seemed to be a "sorcerer's" trick that left me wondering if the sun ever shone in that world. The battle scenes with broad swords are well done, showing that it required a great deal of physical strength and stamina to be a knight or a warrior. Star three
There is a ghastly scene with Morgan le Fey and Mordred, Arthur's illegitimate son. It is the dream or visionary sequence where all of the knights that are searching for the Holy Grail are "captured"  and hung from dead trees in the land of the dead.  This particular sequence works well with the dark mood of the entire film. Star four.
The Lady of the Lake and the Sword in the Stone were magical, ethereal, entrancing. These were well done, perhaps better than any other movie about these legends. Star five.
If you loved the time of magic, the crystal cave, the time of chivalry, Merlin -- then you should see this version.
