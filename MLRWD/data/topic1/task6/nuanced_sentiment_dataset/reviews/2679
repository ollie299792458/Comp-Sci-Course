This is for me, the best ever Burt Reynolds movie, because blockbusters like hooper, smokey & the bandit or are films for little kids and I don't like them anymore. But in the beginning of eighties appeared this extraordinary film directed by Burt Reynolds in a very dynamic way.

the story talks about a great detective from Atlanta that was chasing a big drug dealer. An italian called Victor and his assasing fellow brother. With them at the silver screen, appears the beautifull Rachel Ward (Dominoe). giving the film a realistic performances and making the movie one of the best detectivesque films ever. It reminds me another outstanding film: The Harrison Ford's Movie Blade Runner (1981), directed by Ridley Scott. The polished performance of Burt Reynolds is hilarious, dramatic and some times passionated; giving the image of an isolated man that is alone, an needs some loving reason to go on with his life. This man with "smiling eyes" will find his opportunity to be happy with Dominoe, but there will be some troubles that they'll have to resolve before... Good Luck!
