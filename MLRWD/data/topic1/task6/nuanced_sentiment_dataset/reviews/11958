Whoever "enhanced" the colors in this version of Sleeping Beauty ruined them.  The Princess either drinks too much or spent quality time with solar radiation because her skin glows pink - when it is not disconcertingly changing color.  You can see an example of the type of completely awful skin discoloration I mean in one of the pictures posted above on the listing: the three fairies looking into the cradle.  Okay, so maybe fairies have unnatural skin, but everyone else?  Notice that in that picture the wood of the cradle is pink too.  I know little girls love pink, but did they have to tint EVERYTHING that color?)

If you watch the commercial for this where they show the original coloration and the "enhanced" version side by side, it's pretty obvious the original colors look more natural.  The enhanced stuff looks florescent.  It would be bad enough if that's all that was wrong, but they didn't keep it even.  Things change tint at random, sometimes when all they're doing is just standing there.  If you have a choice, get the older version of this - skip the "new, enhanced" hack job.
