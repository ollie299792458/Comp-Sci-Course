The charm and charisma of John Cusack, one of my favorite actors, and Diane Lane, one of the most beautiful and talented actresses in Hollywood, saves what would be a total waste of time otherwise.

Two recently divorced 40-somethings are brought together via online personals, and the usual, albeit formulaic hilarity ensues. Suffice it to say, this film is very predictable, and follows too many of the same oft-used premises we've seen a million times before----Diane Lane's gay male friend for a shoulder to cry on----Cusacks wise-cracking buddy who's desperate for attention himself----we've seen it all before, but it's the appeal of Cusack and Lane that keep "Must Love Dogs" from being a total re-hashed disaster.

The supporting cast is very strong: Christopher Plummer, looking great in his mid 70's, as Lane's playboy widowed father, the always reliable Elizabeth McGovern as Lane's sister, and Stockard Channing as one of Plummers paramours, all lend a nice hand in making this film (barely) work.

A light, fluffy little film worth the price of a rental, if not a theatre ticket....although I'd pay to watch Diane Lane read the phone book!
