Desperate Housewives was a fun little show in the beginning, but as the season went on, the comedy lacked and got repetative.  How many times can Susan fall on her face?  How many times can Lynette yell at her kids? How many times can Bree clean? How many times can Edie flirt? How many times can Gabrielle complain about money?  It got very dull.

  Also, every plot twist that they threw at us was very predictable.  Half the things they told us at the end of the season were things I predicted in the very first episode.  Also, the mystery throughout the season got very over dramatic.  It was too dramatic to be a dramedy (drama-comedy).  Plus, the answers that were given were very disappointing.  It wasn't worth watching the whole season.  Plus, there was no cliffhanger.

  What bugs me even more than the lack of entertainment that this show has to offer is how big a deal people make about Terri Hatcher.  She isn't very good compared to the other women.  I think that Felicity Huffman is phenominal along with Eva and Marcia.

  I would leave this one to the rental stores.  It isn't something worth watching over and over again.  Save your money.
