This movie is cheesy, even though it's meant that way. The only person i liked in this movie was Alva (played by Maria Conchita Alonso).

Nicholas Cage has definitely changed his voice because when it was in here and also in Valley Girl and Peggy Sue Got Married it was more higher pitched, now when you see him in a movie it's more deeper. And he does a terrible accent in this movie. His acting has gotten better because in here it's just lousy. He plays crazy well but in here it could have been better.

He is a man named Peter Loew who is a publishing executive and he's bit by a vampire (or so he thinks) one night while he takes this woman Rachel (played by Jennifer Beals) home to his apartment for what he thinks will be casual sex, but while they are making out on his bed she bites him on the neck and then basically through out the film he terrorizes Alva when he's at work and he basically goes nuts. Rachel is not even real, she's a figment of his imagination. He finally gets to the point where he truly believes he's a vampire so he goes to a store and buys cheap fangs. Hmmm, okay. Then he goes in a park and catches a pigeon, takes it back to his apartment and eats it. It doesn't get better from there.

Definitely not something i would want to watch again.
