Although LUST, CAUTION was beautiful to look at and the performances were top notch, it didn't really leave me with much of anything.  This was the same way I felt after I saw BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.  I didn't find either film to be thought-provoking or emotionally moving.  I think the problems I found with LUST, CAUTION were that the characters weren't well-developed and as a result, there wasn't much of a story.  I mean, why did Wang get involved with an underground student political movement group?  Based on one line that she said to Kung much later in the film, it could've been because of her attraction to him.  But why wasn't this scenario explored more?  What exactly did Wang see in Kung for her to risk her life?  Were there any similarities or differences that she saw in Mr. Yee?  What exactly was the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Yee?  I never really got a sense of that either.  What did he see in her, and what did she see in him?  Or, in other words, why were they together because you never really saw them together?  (It appeared Mrs. Yee spent more time playing mah jong with her girlfriends than doing anything with her husband.)  Did Mr. and Mrs. Yee have sex and if so, what kind?  Was it brutal like the kind Mr. Yee had with Wang?  None of these issues were explored.  Why didn't Mr. Yee want to interrogate Wang at the end of the film?  That wasn't explored either.  Some critics have said that you have to pay attention to the subtleties in the film to fully understand its story.  I think that's a bunch of baloney.  Either you get it or you don't.  That's the job of the filmmaker--not the filmgoer.  To me LUST, CAUTION was too cautious in revealing information.
