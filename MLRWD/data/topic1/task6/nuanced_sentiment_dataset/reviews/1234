I've never read the book and that's probably why I enjoyed the movie more  than others I know who have partaken in both.  This story is of a Irish  child born into poverty and forced to move back to Ireland with his  family.
Finances are few and far between for the family who is also  cursed by the numerous medical ailments running throughout the world during  the era.  They suffer many losses which leaves the mother with even less  functionality to take care of her brood.
This movie is a long one so set  time aside to truly enjoy it.  The scenery and sets in this film will make  it easy to forget that it was built from scratch instead of being some  historic Irish village.
The young men who portrayed Frank McCourt all put  forth excellent performances as did the woman who played Angela.  Frank's  abusive uncle is a shockingly strong performance for such a small role and  you really end up hating him.
This movie had a lot of strong  performances, a strong storyline (being a true story helps here), and  excellent imagery.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who has two and  a half hours to spare and are looking for an inspiring story of hope and  determination.
