Where do you begin?  Beautifully shot.  The aside commentary by the bit players is often sidesplitting.  Superb costuming for the most part.  Sorry Raquel, yes you look wonderful but out of period.  The pace of the movies is brisk but there is still ample time for the viewer to look deeper into the characters.  Oliver Reed is such a treasure as Athos!  All of the acting is competent but he simply shines in his own dark way.  My quibbles are strictly cosmetic.  There are a few jarring things to me that most wouldn't notice.  Milady de Winter's pistol is just a Philadelphia derringer from the 1850s.  Only off by two hundred years.  And Athos forgets to remove the spanner from his wheel-lock when he confronts Milady.  He's risking a couple of beat up fingers if he pulls the trigger.  And the two pistols in Milady's carriage are Harper's Ferry flintlocks from about 1804.  The swordplay may be the most realistic ever filmed and is a joy to watch again and again.  The commentaries on each disk are quite enlightening and do add to the package and lend even more enjoyment to viewing the finished product.  Forget all of the other versions!  Watch these movies and get a real feel for 1620 and Dumas' vision and genius.
