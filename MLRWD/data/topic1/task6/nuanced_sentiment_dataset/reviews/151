As my title suggests, this disc should have been the special features included with the 'Friday the 13th Box-Set', but it was released a week before the remake's release to cash in on the hype(my conspiracy). Tom Savini, Special Effects extraordinaire, hosts the hour and a half documentary taking the viewer through the history of the franchise via in-person interviews with the films' actors,producers,directors as well as others in the horror movie/entertainment business. The pace of the film is pretty quick, interviews are kept at 'key point only' answers with interludes by Savini to introduce the next topic or film; surprisingly film footage is kept at a minimum due to very in depth descriptions from those interviewed; alot of production photos are used to compliment their stories. Alot of what's said is repeated from the 'Box-Set interviews' about certain production stories(refer to my title), so their will be redundant dialogue to be heard.Definite rent for fans of the franchise and horror movies alike; replay value is a little low due to the very conservative, A&E channel-esque set up of the film, with the exception of Savini's parts.Enjoy-
