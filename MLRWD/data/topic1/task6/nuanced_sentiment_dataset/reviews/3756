This is supposed to be a film by one of the top directors in Hollywood...but what a mess!

My first problem was with the dialogue. Some of the delivery was mumbled and difficult to hear. Then, the one character tends to make something an opposite, and that got confusing. For example, he gets punched in the gut, and instead of saying it hurt, he would say it felt good. I realize this was his way of getting through tough times, but sometimes this logic was applied to out of the ordinary situations and it became confusing.

The next issue was continuity. This film had NONE. All characters suffered this. Watch their hair. In one scene, a hair style can change shape, color, and styles, and no one notices. It can go from flat to fluffy in seconds!  Another boo-boo is one character sneaks back into the house after curfew. he dives into his bed fully dressed, his arm above the covers...in the next second, his arm is completely covered!

And the biggest insult is when a knife goes in someone, since when does it sound like two knives scraping together coming out?
