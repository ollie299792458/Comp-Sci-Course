Well, you can forgive me but I never liked Greek tragedy. Some guy who is a perfect individual indulges themselves one time, and they have their downfall. It's so moralistic it makes me sick.  The only one I enjoyed was Oedipus, a this was because it was so perverse it was amusing.

Yes, it is like a Greek tragedy, but this isn't necessarily a good thing. The film creates a perverse situation from the start, an uncle beats his wives to death because they don't produce babies, which is really a result of him being sterile. So the nephew sleeps with her instead, and they use heavy color symbolism to represent a taint or evil deed. Actually, I think this is a rare condition where as long as it is a one time shot, I think it could be let slide as a neutral or even good act.  Instead, the movie hammers over and over again, that these people are going to get what's coming to them. Instead, this can be construed as the son being loving to the aunt to protect her from sharing the fate of the others, and acting with honor to keep the family line going.

So, first the woman becomes sterile, then the nephew is ridiculed that maybe the uncle can buy a wife for him as good, and meanwhile the son is a bad seed who drowns the uncle without remorse and then tries to shatter the rest of the family. The movie hints that maybe this is a bit unjust, but proceeds to torture you anyway. At this point, I shut it off, and went after a girl (or two) I like. Catharsis doesn't work in tragedy, as in order for it to work, the villain must receive appropriate punishment (and no more than that) and then be returned to at least partial happiness, or at least learning to cope with unhappiness. A better situation would be the father dying, and the two being banished, but they live peacefully out in the countryside somewhere, preferably without the evil kid, maybe because the town seized it from them. But the producer, couldn't bring themselves to do this.
