I am one of the original North American WHO fans from the late 70's-mid 80's PBS era. I had seen and vhs-taped em all! So I am well qualified to NOT recommend this one. It's bad in the painfully boring cure for insomnia level kind of way.  Quite frankly it is the WORST classic Who story of them all. At least tripe like BLACK ORCHID and GUNFIGHTERS didn't drag the suffering for 6 episodes (or was it seven, difficult to say since nothing happens in any of them! I first saw this way back in '83 around 11 pm one Saturday night and I'm telling you I must have fallen asleep 5 times and each time I woke up nothing was still going on !! I later watched my recording of it in full and realised that It was indeed AWFUL!!!  What's worse (as a trivial note), the PBS station in WV (WPBY 33) fragged up the editing of the serial so that several episodes kept repeating themselves over at least 2 times!!! HAHA Man was that bad!!! Like a sort of Hell for DR WHO fans, having to watch episodes 2-3 of the WEB PLANET over and over !!!

BBC needs to release the Hartnell stories that were actually good like CHASE, or even SENSORITES!!
