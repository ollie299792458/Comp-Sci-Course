This film will pull you in from the very first scene.  The cinematography rivals ANY work done today on film.  The scenic landscape in it's cold tone will set you up for a good haunt.  The desolation is practically a character in-and-of itself.  This film is an abyss.  It falls from grace to a level never reached in cinema with the charcters,  the setting,  the lighting,  the blocking and the set decoration.

Although Nicholson's performance is superb,  it is ON point:  I think the supporting cast is far better,  that is saying so much btw.  Duvall's performance is so believable that one cannot help but be mesmerized by the on screen performance.  Danny Lloyd's performance is one of the greatest child performances ever filmed.  His affect,  not words,  bring his character into a realm of existence not seen by a young actor in Hollywood today.

This film captures the past and future.  The foreboding feeling will come over you quick and strong.  This film is the truest of horror:  You will be frightened,  yet not head to the vomitorium.

I'm not certain who to thank for this great film,  Kubrick or the cast and those behind the scenes.  It is NOT fair to judge this film against the novel:  The film is FAR superior.  Great job to all involved.

Perfect films like this only come along once in a "blue moon".  If you've not seen it,  buy it!  If you own it,  watch it again.
