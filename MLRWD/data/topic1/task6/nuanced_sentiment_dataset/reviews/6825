In the very slim chance that Disney reads these reviews, I'd like to pile on to other criticisms in the hope that the Dawn Treader doesn't make the same mistakes.  As a huge C.S. Lewis and Narnia fan, I was so disappointed in Caspian.  Same reasons as many other reviewers: too many unnecessary liberties taken; little dialogue, so very little way to connect with and enjoy the characters; too grim; etc.  At the end of the movie, I felt like I didn't get to spend any time with the characters b/c most of the movie was some sort of battle.

Sure, there were a few good things.  Reepicheep was great; so was the DLF.  The scenery and landscapes were beautiful.  Some of the battles (or parts of battles) were enjoyable and had a sense of honor and bravery.  But that's about it.  Caspian was okay, a little boring.  The posturing between Peter and Caspian was silly, as was the flicker of romance between Caspian and Susan.  Not enough of Aslan.  Not enough of Lucy.  No lessons. Nothing anywhere near the charm of Mr. Tumnus.

You know how at the end of some movies (good ones) you have that feeling like you want more of a good thing?  You wish the movie would go on and on?  (That's why I ripped through all the Narnia books in the first place.)  Well, after watching Caspian, I had a feeling of wanting more of what I knew existed in the book but didn't come through in the movie...it was a yearning for what could have been instead of what was delivered.  It was a huge disappointment and a real shame.  And I truly hope the Dawn Treader can deliver what the first movie did, and what the books all do....a real connection to the characters and a reason to start thinking about what it means to believe in something and to stand up for your beliefs.  I don't think that notion is incompatible with making a block-buster of a movie.
