A fun movie from beginning to end. The story itself is pretty contrived and you need to totally suspend disbelief. It is well worth a series of laughs however as the movie parodies just about every clich&eacute; ranging from hit-men to mobsters. Barring Rosanna Arquette and Kevin Pollack who ham in the most annoying fashion, the rest of the cast i.e. Bruce Willis, Mathew Perry, Michael Clarke Duncan and Amanda Peet are excellent. Willis revels in his usual deadpan style where he has some great one-liners, with Duncan managing to convey menace as well as humor almost in parallel. Perry as the much harassed dentist has a gift for comic timing and comes off well by and large except for his romance with Natasha Henstridge which totally fails to connect. Henstridge herself is pretty subdued, though to be fair, her role in the movie is pretty empty. The surprise packet is Peet as a hit-man groupie who brings real life to her scenes. A light hearted movie and a good way to laugh away a few hours on a lazy weekend.
