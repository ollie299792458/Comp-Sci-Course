I saw Awesome Show and thought it was genius. Then I saw Tom Goes to the Mayor and found it tedious. This movie has much more in common with the latter. In Awesome Show you could see something appalling but then you would move on to something new with new characters. When the characters do bad things in this movie it stays with you through the whole movie making the characters more and more distasteful.
The use of John C Reilly who was amazing as Dr Steve is terrible. What can Mr Reilly do with the tedious snivelling man child that is Tacquito.
Will Ferrell did is usual smirky 'aren't I so funny' bit as in other movies. In fact he wasn't so funny. Stick to movies like 'Everything must go'.
Tim and Eric's commentary indicate they think it is hilarious. Hard to understand how the same guys can make something so funny and so lame.
The elements of awesome show that are in this movie such as the advertisement for shrim have a feeling of no originality.
The movie is lazy and sad.
Awesome show really is genius..don't buy this buy that..
