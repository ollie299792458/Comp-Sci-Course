One day, I decided that I would go and rent a movie. I saw "Le Divorce" on the shelf, and thought- wow that looks cute!! On the cover it says "A Hip, Romantic Comedy"- but now I know that you should never judge a movie by its cover!

This movie is not hip.

It's not romantic.

And it is *definitely* not a comedy!!!!

I didn't know whether to cry because it was so depressing or laugh because it was so.....bad!

This movie has an awesome cast- with Kate Hudson, Glenn Close, etc. But this was probably one of the worst movies that I have ever seen!

It has no plot, and the characters are really confusing. I watched the whole movie, hoping that it would get better...but nope- didn't happen.

Maybe I had high expectations because the previews and the cover looked so good.....but all I can say is that this was a Le Mistake!

(Kate Hudson also gets a really ugly haircut.)

I think that this movie should be re-named "The Red Bag" because the most exciting part of the movie was this red bag that a guy gave her.

If you're thinking of buying this movie- don't!!!!!! Buy something else!!! (Or- you could just rent it just to see how bad it is!!)
