When I first watched McHale's Navy years ago, I thought it was hilarious.  In retrospect, McHale and his happy sailors do not have the staying power of either Andy Griffith or Hogan's Heroes.

The productions technically are fine.  No flaws in the reproduction as I detected; it is the quality of the show that has not held up well with time.

All of the funny guys are still funny:  Joe Flynn, Tim Conway, Ernie Borgnine, and the guys in the crew.  Somehow, the humor now seems thinner than it did orginally and the plots a little too contrived.  Perhaps our expectations of TV sophistication have grown.  Perhaps Andy Griffith was ahead of its time.  Perhaps the characters in other shows are more memorable.

The show has not changed since it was first produced.  It is my perspective that has changed with age.  Perhaps a younger audience would find it as funny now as I did when the originals hit the TV screen, but somehow this classic has faded a bit with time.

It is still funny; just not quite as much now as it was then.
