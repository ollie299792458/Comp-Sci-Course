I tried watching this years ago and barely got to half an hour's worth.  Since then, I've read a number of fine Caravaggio biographies, most recently Francine Prose's brilliant and evocative little book, and admire the artist even more.  So I thought I'd try again.  I made it past halfway and gave up.

I can stand the anachronisms like cigarettes, un-period costumes, a typewriter, etc.  What I couldn't handle was the glacial pace, the vacuousness of Jarman's conceit.  Nothing in the film illuminates the work, and that's sad. He never takes us into the mind or life of the artist (and the over-ripe voice over is a dud), but focuses relentlessly on surfaces.  Some are lovely, some scenes are worth watching, for a moment or two, but then they drag on and on, like the girl/guy swirling a scarf in front of a painting at a party so long you want to slap her or him.  The movie is a dumb show, a pantomime.  You want to do a fantasia or meditation on the artist's life, fine, but how dare you make the life of this brilliant, amazing, scandalous, sui generis painter boring?
