As has been mentioned, this two-disc set contains one classic funny film, 'The Cameraman,' another film which is also quite good but not quite as great, 'Spite Marriage' (though the scene where the play is being screwed up on the stage is incredibly funny, the funniest bit of the film), a lot of great extras, and one dud, Buster's first talkie, 'Free and Easy.'  It's lovely to hear his voice (which was very pleasant and deeper than some people might expect from a man of such diminutive stature), and I suppose by early talkie standards it's not so bad, but taken with the two classic films, the wonderful documentary about Buster's career and subsequent downfall at MGM (thanks to greedy and inept studio executives who miscast him, gave him poor material, wouldn't let him improvise enough gags, made him do things they thought were funny even though he didn't agree with them, and made him relinquish a lot of the creative control he'd enjoyed prior, when he was an independent), the commentary on the two films, and the interesting photo montages, it stands as a real dud.  The laughs on 'Free and Easy' are few and far between, and even the few funny bits just aren't that funny or inventive.  Like is pointed out in the documentary, when the transition to sound was complete, the bosses wanted verbal comedy instead of slapstick or gags that didn't need to be accompanied by witty banter or an explanation of why it was funny, and so shut out a lot of what makes silent comedy so classic and timeless.  They didn't want to merge the best of both worlds, keeping what was so great about silent comedy and adding the extended possibilities of verbal humor, they just wanted to work with sound comedy alone, even if the performer didn't like it.  For example, that whole bit about "the queen has swooned," where Buster keeps getting the lines mixed up and then saying the wrong things, might actually have been funny if it had been delivered by a comic like Stan Laurel, but Buster's comic persona isn't the type whom we would expect this kind of thing from; he doesn't make it funny or believable that his character would be that inept and stupid as to keep getting the lines mixed up.  At the end of this film, you might even want to cry, first because it ends so suddenly, almost in media res, then again because for once his character doesn't get the girl, then because it's such a pitiful film, then because you know it was the beginning of the end for a comedic legend who was so rudely abused and miscasted by greedy studio bosses, then because it's a sore reminder of what a big step back filmmaking took when the transition to sound was complete (it took at least 7 or 8 years for the craft to recover and get back to making pictures on the masterful level that had been achieved during the last few years of the silent era), then once more because you actually watched the whole thing and can't get that time back.
