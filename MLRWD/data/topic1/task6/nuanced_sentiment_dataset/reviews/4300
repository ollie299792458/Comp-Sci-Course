Whada-ya-know?  A double feature!  Just like the good old days when I was a kid, going off on a Saturday morning to see a pair of movies at the local Broadway Theater!  And what a good choice for a twin-bill.  Two classic Vincent Price outings!
Haunted Hill is a typical William Castle gimmick movie.  He was famous for his hokey put-ons to promote his works.  Like wiring some of the seats in the theater to give some unlucky patrons a mild electric shock for effect in The Tingler!  Or supplying life insurance policies in case someone had a fatal heart attack while watching one of his thrillers.  The gimmick for Haunted Hill was a skeleton on a wire that floated above the audience at the critical scene!  Castle was an old-time showman, all right!
Ubaldo Ragona is much less well-known, to say the least, but his version of Richard Matheson's novel, I Am Legend, is a pretty solid piece of work, with Price giving a very credible performance as a desperate man alone in a world of living-dead vampires who want him to join them in their non-death.  
The image quality in Haunted Hill is quite good, but there are few bonus features on this disc.  Just some mini-biographies and a short chapter index.  Unfortunately, the image quality in Last Man is not of the best and the main title credits are elongated in this full screen version of a widescreen movie.  Still. it's very watchable and enjoyable.  This DVD is a bargain at its price, and all Price fans will want to add it to their library.
