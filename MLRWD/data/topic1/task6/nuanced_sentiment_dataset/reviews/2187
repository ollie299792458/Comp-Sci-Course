I enjoyed the first. It was dumb, senseless fun. This feels like a straight to DVD sequel so I guess it makes sense that it was released worldwide video on demand instead of theaters. The scenes all feel rushed. You will notice several editing mistakes between scenes and none of them ever have a chance to take hold. The trailer really did show the best parts of the movie. I really did give this one a chance in hopes for another ridiculous gory hour and a half but it didn't do it for me. It isn't one of those so bad it's good movies either. It's just bad. Leaves you feeling nothing, frankly. Usually when watching horror movies like this you leave laughing or shaking your head at the craziness. The characters had no clever lines nor interesting subplots. The main character being the piranhas didn't even have much time to shine. Most of the shots were of a shadowy school of them in a muddy lake. Zero tension.

Oh well. Watch it if you don't believe me.

I would however wait for the HD or 3D version though. This streams in 480p.

I assume they released VOD instead of theaters because someone released it would tank on the big screen. So good call there. At least this way people will pay out of sheer curiousity.

This could have been great!
