Full disclosure: as someone who's been a bibliophile pretty much since the time I learned to read, Ray Bradbury's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345342968">Fahrenheit 451</a> is a story that will always be near and dear to my heart, and any version of it that isn't completely incompetent is probably going to move me at least a little bit. Fran√ßois Truffaut's 1966 film adaptation is no exception, although as is often the case with movies of the past that are set in the then-future (which is now the past)(confusing, isn't it?), there are many moments of unintended hilarity to the modern viewer; my personal favorite is when Julie Christie pulls a device off the wall which is supposed to be a telephone but more closely resembles a cheap curling iron. Having said that, the Technicolor cinematography (by Nicholas Roeg, destined to become an acclaimed auteur in his own right) is gorgeous, the color schemes are among the most carefully thought-out I've ever seen (all the more amazing considering this was Truffaut's first color film), and there are scenes whose power is still undeniable (the scene with the woman with the box of matches is heartbreaking). FAHRENHEIT 451 isn't in the same league as a film like 1968's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48SG">2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, but it's still fitfully arresting and is certainly worth a look.
