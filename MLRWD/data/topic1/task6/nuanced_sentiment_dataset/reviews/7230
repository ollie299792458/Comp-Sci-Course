I've been a big American Pie fan since the beginning. I love the characters and all their odd quirks. Jims sexual disfunctions, Finches pretensions and obsessions with his MILF, Stifler and his profanity, Jims Dad and his eyebrows and Michelles flute box all make me laugh time and time again and so it was with great anticipation that I saw American Wedding the summer it came out.

It was funny and it was great seeing old friends but some of the heart was missing and the pie had grown stale just a tad. Something about focusing the entire movie and Stifler just threw the chemistry off. Jim was the viewpoint character in the first two flicks but Seann William Scotts popularity had eclipsed that of Jason Biggs and thusly he dominated the movie at the expense of the other characters.

Scott is fun to watch but you can't take an ensemble series and turn it into a one man show which is what they did so it didn't entirely work. When they worked the rest of the cast in the movie excelled. It was really the overemphasis on Stifler that really dragged the movie down and I consider myself a Stifler fan. But Stifler works better in small pieces of the pie not in huge chunks.

Its still a damn fun movies, especially the unrated version, but it ranks slightly below the first two pies for me.
