OKAY. this movie rocked! I was screaming and hiding my face all the way through this shocking, discusting, scary-as-hell tale. This movie would be good even without all the blood and gore! The fact that these poor people are basically playing "Hide And Go Seek" with these discusting, deformed, crazy cannibal maniacs, that actually jump for joy when they find some people to hunt. This mvie was soooo good. I jsut cant wait until it comes out on DVD & VIDEO!! I love Horror Movies, and this is my new favorite. I mean...i cant even explain how scared you get when you watch this. You shuld defiently see this-if you dont, then your missing out! Just the sight of these imbred,deformed, men make you scared.  The movie hadnt even completly started and i was already getting freaked out! lol. Damn, this movie is just great, and the acting is good. But I was just angry when the guy from "Six Feet Under" died-i thought his g/f should have went since she complained so much...But im not going to say anymore!
Just see it and never go to the woods in West Virginia again-I know I wont! hehe...
Id give this thing 5 stars x 10 if I could!
