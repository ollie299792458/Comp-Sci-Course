I know all you people may say this anime doesn't have a plot, but it actually has a very intricate storyline. It is bizarre, but if you PAY ATTENTION it makes sense.
Haruko is a 19 year old member of the Space Police who comes to earth chasing a being composed entirely of energy known as Atomsk. Although she is a member of the space police, Haruko is very self centered and wishes to capture Atomsk so that she can consume his energy and steal his power ( Atomsk has enough power too steal planets). When she finds that he isn't on earth, she opens inter-dimensional transport waves in Naota (main character's) head by hitting him with a guitar. Transporting stuff across the galaxy is a huge gamble, but at the end of the first episode, Haruko manages to pull Atomsk out of Naota's head. Now Medical Mechanica, the space Police affiliates on earth, are trying to destroy Haruko and recpature Atomsk (who posses the robot known as Kanti). Below all this chaos is the story of Naota's coming of age.
THAT'S THE PLOT RIGHT THERE, PEOPLE!!!
