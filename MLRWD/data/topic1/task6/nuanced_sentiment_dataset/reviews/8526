Sieglinde is gloriously sung by Jessye Norman, but perhaps we must accept the heft of her physical presence as a legacy of the old tradition for operatic sopranos, so different from the nubile divas who reign today. James Morris acts well but suffers frequent reproach for being vocally past his prime; however, in this performance i find that he uses the voice he has to excellent effect, with flawless musicianship. The scenery and stage direction are stodgy, but again, this is the old tradition for the Metropolitan Opera, not the theater-savvy regime of its present general director. Deutsche Grammophon's audio and video here are somewhat below the standards of their present-day products, but acceptable.

What is unacceptable are the English subtitles for most of Act 3 (on Disk 2). They are hopelessly garbled and out of synch,  with endings of sentences often appearing two or more frames ahead of their beginning (and believe me, this is not due to the idiosyncrasies of German sentence structure). The first two acts on Disk 1 are completely free of this disconcerting defect. What happened to Quality Control for Disk 2?
