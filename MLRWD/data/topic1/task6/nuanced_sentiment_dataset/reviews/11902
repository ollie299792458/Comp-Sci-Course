I am old, and I am from Kansas.  I heard this band when they were new and saw them play many times over the years.  While I appreciate their embrace of their Kansas roots by producing a live DVD in Topeka's Washburn University auditiorium, and I thank them for past greatness and transcendent moments of musicality, this release is troubling.  Granted, Steve Walsh was one of the great rock voices in his day, but the magic is long gone. You just wince to hear how his voice has changed.  The symphony seems superfluous to music that already sounds syphonic as a six-piece ensemble, and I feel it dulls the edge of the rock sound in spots.  The video direction disappoints as well, with the director cutting to a wide shot just as Kerry Livgren launches into on of the most powerful, understated guitar solos of all time during "Hold On". (Someday I'd like to see a concert video that truly recreates the experience of sitting in the best seat, seeing the whole show at once, rather than some director's shot choices.)
  The best track of this release is the bonus track of "Down The Road" which they recorded during the afternoon sound check.  This is the Kansas I love, rocking out hard and unencumbered by a huge symphony and the strain of making "The DVD". Steve Morse seems to scare violinist Ragsdale during this song! One could argue that this track, alone, makes it worth the price of the disc.  If you're a fan of the group, sans Robbie and Dave with only a cameo from Kerry, you need to see the show. I'm glad they made it, and I suppose having seen them in the old days is a handicap for us geezers on this one.  Any Kansas performance is a gift in these musically-starved times.
