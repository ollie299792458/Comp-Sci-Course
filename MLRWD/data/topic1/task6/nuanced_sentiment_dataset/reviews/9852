First things first...the only reason I was aware of this movie is due to the fact that I just saw "Haywire" and was so impressed with Ms. Gina Carano that I wanted to see if she had been in anything else. The first thing that I noticed was the REALLY poor acting. The kid that plays "Pinball" was last seen in "Hook" (yes, the Peter Pan flick. Rufio, at least that was the last time I saw him). Well, turns out Ms. Carano was in the movie for about 30 seconds. The pros...the fight scenes are VERY entertaining! But, anyone who watches MMA knows that 90% of the really outstanding moves are something you see once in a blue moon. The fights have been scripted to utilize these "wow" moves strung together to look very impressive, but they just don't happen that way in the real thing. It's a showcase movie, I get it. We've seen this movie a million times before with Steven Seagal, Van Damme, etc...). Eamonn Walker's character is a really bad Wesley Snipes copy. New kid on the block has got mad skills, he takes out bad guy's best fighter with very little effort. Bad guy wants to hire him. You know the rest. If you can get by the NUMEROUS racial slangs, Hollywood's glammed-over idea of street hoods and fighters and just enjoy the action? It's fun.
