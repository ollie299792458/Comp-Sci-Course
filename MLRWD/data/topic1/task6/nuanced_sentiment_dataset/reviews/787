There is no question that Michael J Fox is a pleasure to watch in this romantic comedy set in the corporate world of the 1980's. He is supported by several worthy co-stars and a solid but not too demanding of a script. The movie is aimed for those who enjoy screwball comedies and are comforted by happy endings.

 The Secret of My Success is deftly directed by Herbert Ross (now deceased) who proves once again that he was a man interested in entertaining and not challenging his audiences. Personally, I periodically like to watch a comedy that offers 90 minutes of harmless laughs, but at almost two hours this movie runs out of steam.

 Fox stars as Brantley Foster, an improbable name for someone from a farming town in Kansas, who gets a job in New York City after finishing college. Unfortunately, he's fired on the same day he's supposed to start work, since the company was recently taken over. After several days of looking for another job, he remembers that he has an uncle in New York, who runs a major corporation. His uncle starts him in the mail room and soon Fox's character will meet the woman of his dreams, be seduced by his aunt, and begin to pretend he's a newly hired executive.

 Fox works the gags with practiced ease, but as with all screwball comedies, the audience can only be expected to suspend their disbelief for just so long. All in all a solid effort by Fox and Ross, and I recommend this movie to anyone looking for an afternoon of formula comedy.
