Many professional critics have said that the new Manchurian Candidate is a successful remake of the classic. Obviously enough, I disagree. The remake is still a good movie, but it is by no means comparable to the original film.

Both are corny in their own way. The politics in the remake are corny (showing a picture of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates' faces on Mt. Rushmore at the convention). In the original the mind-control/brain-washing is corny. But in the original, this corniness has a similar charm to the old Twilight Zone.

A problem with this film is that in some scenes, it takes itself far too seriously, while in other scenes it appears to be unintentionally comical.

It was also difficult for the writers to transfer a conspiracy to take over the US government from the Cold War to the modern era, replacing the Sino-Soviet empire of the early Cold War with a powerful conglomerate. After all, how many politicians aren't in the pocket of conglomerates these days without being brain-washed?

All of the actors -- Washington, Schreiber, Streep, and Voigt -- give strong performances. The directing needs some work, though.
