I'm pleasantly surprised to see that this film has such good Amazon reviews. Even though it's a beautifully done, charming film, my friends insist on scoffing at me when I mention it as my favorite of ALL TIME!! My hunch is that it's a film that must be watched for it's subtleties. 
In print, the plot is average. It's the tale of some average guys (and a couple of beautiful girls) who get together in a small New England town to attend their ten year high school reunion. Of course this would be completely drab if not for the loveable characters and unbelievable chemistry of the cast. In fact, the most intriguing sub-plot (the May-December crush between Willie and Marty) would've been an on screen disaster had not the chemistry between Timothy Hutton and Natalie Portman been so on.
And as for subtleties, I've watched this film an estimated 25 times and always pick up something new; a line, joke or other character dynamic that went past me before jumps out and I guess that's why I've watched it so much. 
The only warning I have is this. This movie is billed as a comedy. In reality, you might be choking back more tears than laughter. Although there are some good comedic moments, as a from-the-gut drama, this movie sparkles!
