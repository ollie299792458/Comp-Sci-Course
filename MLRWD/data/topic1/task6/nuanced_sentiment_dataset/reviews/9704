Okay - so I have a fascination for Cleopatra and have read whatever I can get my hands on on this woman, very few accounts describe the true essence of Cleopatra and rather we are bombarded with propaganda from Rome, who didn't think much of a Queen in a client country (under Roman rule) in opposition to Caesar towards the later part of her life. She was incredibly charming, witty, intelligent and oozing with finese. She ruled the Egypt with an steady hand and won the hearts of her people by respecting there gods, learning their language (past Pharohs spoke Greek- none took the time to learn their native Egyptian lauguage)and ruling fair and justly attending to all matters with her people personally brandishing a smile. She effectively managed the country's supply of food while selling rashings to other countries (like Rome), managed the creating of fleet ships in Alexandria, praised herself as a direct descent from Alexandar the great. With all this said I was expecting to see a vibrant, lively, seductively charming woman with a sharp tongue and incredible wit.

The character of Cleopatra portrayed was soo far from the charming, charsmatic woman. Elizabeth Taylor played a bratty queen with a power hungry thrist to end the world if she had to just to gain wealth. This was not Cleopatra at all, she was strong yes and she had authority yes, but she also was the epitome of feminity - full of grace, bathed in milk and honey - not bratty or annoying but charming and with her soothing words she made men fall to her knees. I was not impressed with the character displayed in this movie at all. It portrayed a amazing queen as a spoilt princess.
