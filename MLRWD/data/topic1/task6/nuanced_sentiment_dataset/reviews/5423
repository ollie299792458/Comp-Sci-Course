The delivery of this item was top-notch. It got here pronto and in perfect shape, just like the majority of the good reviews about this vendor said it would. I chose to buy this item for my little boy from Electric Fantasies because the business had such good reviews.

Unfortunately, when I got it, it was the wrong thing. Let me be clear -- THAT IS ENTIRELY MY FAULT. I was looking for a DVD of Batman, and what I bought, accidentally, was a UMD movie for PSP. It came up in the search I put into Amazon for the DVD, and I did not look closely enough before buying.

However, I have now written to the company THREE times. Each time was two weeks apart. I have asked if it is possible to return the item (it has not been opened) for all or partial credit and get a DVD instead. I don't have a PSP and I don't want one. Of course, I offered to pay the shipping and any additional costs that may be accrued in acquiring the DVD. And, I also said that if the DVD cost less, that I would be happy to let the profit be kept.

I do not think that it is unreasonable to ask for a simple yes or no answer, especially in light of the fact that I have tried to be upfront and conciliatory about the matter. As I stated, good, professional delivery -- bad follow up. Make sure you know exactly what you are getting with this vendor, or you will be stuck with something you don't want.
