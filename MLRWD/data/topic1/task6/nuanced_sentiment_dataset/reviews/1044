Megadeth with Dave Mustaine in vocals is one of the best things I'll ever know. The first album by Megadeth I have ever heard was "Countdown to Extinction" and since I've been a true Megadeth fan. This DVD has been filmed after "The World Needs a Hero" and so it doesn't give the best possible picture that Megadeth had to give. Most of the songs like "Hook in Mouth" and "Holy Wars" are as aggressive as before. Megadeth has had a long carriere and it is also noticable that there aren't all the great songs but I am quite satisfies with this set list...sure "Last Rites/Loved to Death", "The Conjuring", "Set the World Afire" etc. would have been cool but it is important they can play also the newer stuff from "The World Needs a Hero". Some of those songs are quite good, some are OK. I like especially the songs "1000 Times Goodbye" and "Dread And the Fugitive Mind" but the songs "Return to Hangar", "Burning Bridges" are quite average Megadeth and why there's no songs from "Risk"? "Prince of Darkness" and "Insomnia" would be great played as live. This live DVD is quite great if you notice that Dave Mustaine have to both sing and play guitar...there's somthing in Megadeth that makes this a great DVD. The other gig (underground gig) is black and white and is a little worse than the main concert.
