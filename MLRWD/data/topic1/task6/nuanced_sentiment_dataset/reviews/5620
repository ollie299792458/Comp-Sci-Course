Dangerous Liaisons is a lush and lavish glimpse into the lives of the 18th century French aristocracy.  The Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont used to be lovers and are now close friends, a powerful but restrained attraction still simmering between them.  They are both twisted people who enjoy manipulating everyone around them, but the foundation of their demise is laid when they make a bet - if Valmont can seduce the virtuous Madame de Tourvel, a married woman of unimpeachable morals, the Marquise will give herself to him for one whole night of romance.  What neither anticipates is that Valmont will fall in love with Tourvel, and that the Marquise will become victim to a destructive jealousy.
Glenn Close is marvelous as the depraved Marquise, and ever so subtly reveals to us the insecurities behind the noblewoman's coldly smiling facade.  Malkovich proves that a man does not need to be conventionally handsome in order to be seductive; he exudes serpentine charm and masterfully acts out the Vicomte's slow and astonishing change of heart.  The dialogue is witty and stirring, and the costumes are candy for the eyes.  This was a thoroughly enjoyable film.
