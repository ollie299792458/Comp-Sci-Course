I don't care for this DVD compared to her others which I love. If you chose anything over a 1 mile walk, it still does it mile by mile so it's not like 5 separate workouts, they are labeled 'blue mile' 'yellow mile' 'red mile' green mile' 'purple mile.' So if you choose Tuesday which is supposed to be a 2 mile workout, it is actually the blue mile then pauses and switches next to the yellow mile. So your heart rate doesn't stay at a high pace for the main part of the workout, after the first mile it will go back down again at the beginning of the 2nd mile then work it's way up again, so it's not consistent. It does have an option where you can create your own workout by selecting which miles and toning exercises you want to do which is nice. I love the ab, arm, and leg toning exercises, they are intense and only a few minutes. She is not alone in the miles but in the toning she is by herself. So far I think her best DVD is 'Burn Body Fat. 1, 2, 3 miles' I think that DVD gives you the best overall fat burning workout while also strengthening your arms. LOVE LESLIE!!!
