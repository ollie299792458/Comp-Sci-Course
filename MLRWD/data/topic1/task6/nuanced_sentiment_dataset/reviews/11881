If you like themes such as man's self destructive nature, humans destroying the planet, the military leadership prefers military solutions over diplomacy, and all nature is good and technology is bad, then you will enjoy the content of this movie.

If you like overacted canned lines, where bad guys have sinister voices, and good guys speak in smooth dulcet tones, then you'll enjoy the dialog.

If you appreciate CGI where everything is in focus no matter how close or far away it is, all objects stay in focus no matter how fast you zoom in on them from a distance, where every object surface is evenly textured, where the air contains no dust or particles to create light beams to add some sense of atmosphere with space and depth other than vanishing point perspective, and where there are no simulated lens artifacts or any other attempts at simulating optics the way the human eye experiences them, then you'll enjoy the animation.

If you like themes that have been recycled so many times that only the youngest of children or most severe amnesiacs will find the ideas original, then you might enjoy this movie.

If you enjoy the smell of freshly utilized cat litter or dumpsters outside fish processing plants in July, then you have the olfactory discrimination to appreciate this stinker.
