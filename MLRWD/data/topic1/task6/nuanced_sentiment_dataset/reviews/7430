I won't go into a review of the series because there are 15 5-Star ratings and they will all tell you just how great of a show this is. What I will be reviewing is the actual box set. I have been waiting for a complete collection because the part sets are a bit too expensive. Now that I have what I wanted, I am a little disappointed to be honest.

First I'll start off with the good:

- The price is amazing for a 33 episode set.
- Nice new disc art (The part sets had pretty plain discs).
- Awesome inner cover art.

And... That's pretty much it.

Now for the bad:

- The nice holographic effect used on the covers of the part sets is not present.
- The cover looks plain because of what was stated above.
- Could have chose better front cover art (they used the original promotional photo).
- No bonuses like the postcards in this set.
- For a complete collection you'd think they could have mustered up some DVD extras that weren't on the part sets.

I know the old saying "you get what you paid for", but Funi should have spent little more time on this set. The product just looks a bit rushed and incomplete. This isn't a bad set at all, it's just a budget one. If you're interested in the series and don't want to spend a lot, buy this. If you're a big fan and want something a bit nicer, buy the part sets.

My actual rating would be 3.5 stars.
