I laughed in looking through the reviews of this earlier, because someone said "this is not as bad as some 'wannabe critics' make it out to be"...so I guess that means this guy is a professional critic, or he lied when answering the question "are you over 13?"

Let's see, this film opens with lots of loud rock music, some 20-somethings at Mardi Gras  drinking lots of alcohol & smoking lots of dope, and then, oh wow, man, they have a car wreck?  They hit a tree?  But, I guess they also hit some guy that's under the car too, someone that some orderlies at the local hospital have been looking for, and since these young folk seemed to be a bit banged-up too, they get to go along for the ride back to the hospital.  Which is, of course, almost empty, and perhaps things aren't quite what they seem?

Of course, things are NOT what they seem, otherwise we'd have no movie. (and that would have been bad because..?)  One by one, our poor little 20-somethings head off to the exam rooms and never come back.  Kindly and benevolent Dr. Robert Patrick is taking good care of them, but he may have an ulterior motive or two.

This film, for being made in what is supposed to be an almost-abandoned hospital, is surprisingly lacking in any sort of atmosphere or suspense.  Never have gore & insane medical experiments been so boring.  I have no idea what the appeal of this film might be, because while it does seem to contain all the elements that would MAKE a fairly decent horror film, they just kind of lie there, not doing anything.  So what that leaves is your basic "paint by the numbers" film, which some people seem to feel is just great, but perhaps they haven't seen anything REALLY worthwhile before.

With very few exceptions, these After Dark Horror Films are nothing but mediocre (or worse) junk, yet, they must sell, or they wouldn't still be putting them out....maybe if people stop buying them, they'd go away?  One can only hope.  1 out of 5.
