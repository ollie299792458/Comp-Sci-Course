The box is so thoughtful. I get to strip away Finn's shirt and hat, then his skin, then his muscles, and then take his skull and brain out...pretty cool. What I like best about having the dvd is being able to watch episodes that they censored or don't show on tv because of their awesomeness. There is only commentary on 4 episodes, and the first two are just a group of voice actors messing around (kind of unsatisfying), so I didn't even bother watching the other two yet. The other special features are forgettable, and after watching the beginning of the behind the scenes, I almost completely lost interest in watching the rest, and I have yet to do so. I guess I have to remember that this is a show meant for little kids, not 25 year old nerds. I want to know everything about the show, where the inspiration came from and stuff like that. Overall, it didn't disappoint, and it is a lot better than "My two favorite people". I will buy the next season if it is like this or better, but anything less and I would be complaining.
