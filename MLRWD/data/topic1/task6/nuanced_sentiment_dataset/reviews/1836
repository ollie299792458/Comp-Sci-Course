OLIVER STONE by now has treated every theme possible about the AMERICAN institutions.He has sometimes succeeded in doing so(PLATOON,BORN IN THE FOURTH OF JULY,JFK);sometimes he failed miserably(HEAVEN AND EARTH,NIXON).ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is a fair movie about that marvelous AMERICAN institution called football.The usual four letter words are present;the overuse of montage is also on display;these are two items you can always find in any STONE movie.Characters often talk all in the same time.Yet ANY GIVEN SUNDAY has entertaining value,and tells a few truths well included in the script(Television killed that sport).CHARLTON HESTON a real AMERICAN legend has one scene;the use of clips of BEN-HUR is out of place.One of the pleasant surprize of this film is the performance of CAMERON DIAZ as the team's owner.As for AL PACINO,he gives his usual foul mouthed speeches,sometimes annoying,sometimes on target.If you don't think about it too much,you can actually swallow this piece of AMERICAN junk without trowing up.Good luck!
