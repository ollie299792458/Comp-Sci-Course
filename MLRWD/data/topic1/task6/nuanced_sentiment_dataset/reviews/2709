I truly thought Sean William Scott's typical character (raucous, sexist, full of energy) would translate perfectly to his role in this film (or at least what my perception of his role in the film was based on the trailers). I am sad to say, I was completely wrong. This is a movie I was dying to like, and as it continued I progressed through some theatrical equivalent to the five stages of grief and loss.

-Denial that it could be this bad-surely the story would redeem itself in the end.

-Anger that the sport I love could be treated so crudely. When Liev Schreiber's character two-hand's another player in the head with his stick it is treated as if it were commonplace. Jay Baruchel's character hoots with glee. No true hockey enthusiast would ever glorify or endorse such behavior, and certainly nobody that had ever actually played the game. Fighting is an important part of this fast and physical sport. Blows to the head like that (when they happen) are sources of shame and a disservice to the game (see Marty McSorely/Donald Brashear incident, McSorely never played in the NHL again).

-Bargaining: I rationalized that perhaps the stick swinging scene was a blip in the radar, a difference of opinion (though I found it hard to believe that many hockey fans would agree with its treatment in the movie). The rest of the movie would make up for it. After all, LaFlamme's character does at least have some pretty good hands (his goals are more believable than the Mighty Ducks, for example).

-Depression set in when I realized that this truly was a turd of a movie. I enjoyed few laughs despite the fact that Sean William Scott is one of my favorite comedic actors. He is borderline retarded and his romance in the movie doesn't even make sense in anything more than a rudimentary sense that we knew he had to have one because it's a mainstream film release (well sort of).

-Acceptance: As Doug's ankle broke (grotesquely), so too did my heart as I accepted that the movie was a hockey-flavored turd. There are redeeming qualities to it, but they are so few and overshadowed by so many inequities. If you are a hockey purist, don't waste your time. If your curiosity truly gets the best of you (as it did me) then rent, don't buy.

One final note: I was inspired to write this review when before a recent game at my local rink, the movie became the topic of conversation. About half of the locker room had seen Goon and the unanimous reaction was "Don't waste your time." Straight from a beer league locker room. Unfortunately, I can't think of a more fitting audience for the movie, and everybody hated it.
