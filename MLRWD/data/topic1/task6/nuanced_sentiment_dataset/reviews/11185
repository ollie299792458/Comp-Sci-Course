After a disappointing 4th season, i wanted to continue watching because i owed it to the series some of the best seasons on tv ever, so i didn't get my hopes up much, i didn't even think there would be a creative attack, plot or anything...

I was dead wrong.

This season opened with an unbelievable first episode that blew me away, and the suspense stayed all way. Now, i have watched every season, i have watched alias, i have watched lost,blablabla..i have come to learn to predict and expect most of the twist and turns here and there along the plot. This time, they caught be my surprise every time. It is simply incredible! This season presents a complete new chapter for jack bauer. It regained all its glory from season 2 a few blocks back, and it kept going. Since the story is one of the main elements of the series, i will do my best not to reveal any of it

Here are just a few of the pros of this season:

A complicated plan and intentions from the bad guys pulling all the strings, totally passing the mediocre plot of "Kill americans and that's it" from season 4

A terrefic episode featuring a brief but great apperance by jack's daughter

Old and new characters mixing well together

Mind blowing plot twists that made my jaw drop to the floor.It is simply great, as you watch, the show totally transmits every feeling necessary to make these episodes keep you glued to your seat every week.

A clif hanger that leaves you wanting for the begginning of the 6th season.

Great acting from the cast, martha, jack, karen, secretary heller, everyone...

Overall, they totally deserved this emmy. The show had a message in other seasons: If things are bad, don't worry, they can always get worse (well, in the 4th season it was the opposite, but no matter).

This season is ground breaking, 5 Stars, 2 thumbs way up, outstanding. Watch it or buy it, you won't regret it
