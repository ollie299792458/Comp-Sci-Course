This is one of greatest series in tv history. And like The Wonder Years and WKRP in Cincinnati series, the dialogue is butchered and fragmented because of omitted music. The studio's excuse is always the royalties to each music artist is too costly. Well, guess what studio pinheads, I hope you take a drastic loss producing these lousy series sets. When you paid the musicians to use their songs intially, why didn't you set up a fair contract to use those rights for later series sets on DVD? I suppose you didn't have enough foresight to see this coming. What a bunch of incompetent jackasses. Do the right thing and pay what needs to paid and you will see your precious profits. We are the customers...and we are always right. One last thing, since I saw some of these episodes on HD Net, the right thing to do is to transfer every episode (because all episodes were shot in film like Cheers) to Blu Ray. It's an easy transfer when you have film stock. This would make this the ultimate Complete Series!
