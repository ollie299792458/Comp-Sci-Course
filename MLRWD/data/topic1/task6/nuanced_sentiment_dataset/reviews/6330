I am upset that I even have to give this a 1 star- it should be a 0 star. How Denise Austin can even call this a Yoga tape is beyond me. Yes, she does a few yoga moves but they are spaced in between her own version of aerobics. Therefore the yoga totally gets lost in this dvd. If I wanted an aerobics tape, I would have purchased one. If you want a yoga tape in which poses are held for any length of time- this is not the dvd for you. If you are a beginner this is not the tape for you as she gives no instruction on the moves and how to do them. Every piece of this dvd annoyed me. When they got to the "tree sequence" (in which they held the tree maybe for 5 seconds in between a bunch of other lunges and arm moves that did nothing more than make them look ridiculous) I had to turn it off. This dvd did not relax me, it made me upset that I wasted any money on it (not to mention the fact that Denise Austin and her narrating are the absolute most annoying and grating things on the face of the Earth!). If you want yoga, there are so many better dvd's out there. This should not even be called yoga!
