The first time I saw MANIAC I was really bummed out. I love slasher movies and MANIAC is just a real downer. There's no JOY in this movie to speak of. It's like the polar opposite of EVIL DEAD 2 - a grim, sick journey through the mind of a freak with a mommy fetish.

Now if you are a gore freak then this movie represents total nirvana. Savini's effects are amazingly realistic - there's no way any filmmaker could get away with this stuff these days. NO WAY! This movie must have gone out unrated.

I saw it overseas years ago on VHS and it was edited pretty heavily. Not this DVD - every sick frame is included for your enjoyment. You gotta admire Savini's genius. It's amazing stuff. My fave moment is when he blows his own head off with a shotgun - nice.

Just remember - it's a joyless little excursion into depravity but if you're into that kind of thing you can't go past this movie. This would have to rank up there as one of the most sadistic pictures to come out of the US during the 80s.

Great poster art for this movie.

Enjoy....
