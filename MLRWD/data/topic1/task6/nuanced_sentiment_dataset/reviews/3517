As the glass ceilings disappear, the sun shines every brightly. Congratulations to the women and men who shine under the Tuscan sun. There are many wonderful moments in this empathetic, loving film. The characters are drawn together by a series of seemingly individual hardships (divorce, single parenthood, government supression, poverty, refugee status, materialism, prejudice, depression...the list can go on). Their involvement in the refurbishment of an historic villa (honor the past and serve the needs of the present?) allows us to see their common humanity and presents us with whole people, not charicatures.
Many have acknowledged Diane Lane's fine performance here. I found truth in each character and in myself the ability to empathize freely with each one. 
The director/writer/everything created a tour de force opportunity for every actor in this film and I believed each one of them.
Just for myself- special thanks to Sandra Oh from a fellow 2nd generation Korean.
Aloha and enjoy the warm sun of this movie. It shines on anyone who would step out of the shade.
