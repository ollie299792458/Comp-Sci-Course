This cliche-ridden insult to the intelligence of the viewer as well as the art of Japanese horror deserves to take its "Dream Cruise" at the bottom of the sea. First, you have the Westerner living in Japan and being a complete yutz. (This is cliche #1). Next, you have the lovely Japanese wife who cheats on her "stern" husband with said Westerner. (This is cliche #2). Next, you have the boss offering his Western "friend" a weekend with him and his wife. (This is not quite cliche yet, but give it some time). Finally, you have the "surprise" ending in which the Western yutz gets away with what he does and lives happily with the cheating wife. How lovely. The only reason to own this is because it is included in the season 2 skull set. Incidentally, it works well as a coaster to rest your drink on while you watch brilliant fare like "The Black Cat" or Hideo Nakata's work, whether it is "Ringu", "Ringu 2", "The Ring 2" (here's an idea! Fill a Japanese style horror movie with Americans and set it in...The United States! Everyone's so busy stuffing Westerners into Tokyo they forgot about THAT little location.)
MOH has hit a new low, but the season also has many good episodes, so it is worth buying "the skull" but not this disc as an individual movie.
