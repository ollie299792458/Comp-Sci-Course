I should have watched this movie before Pride & Prejudice.  I understand the screenplay & directors were different so it was weird that I kind of expected the same results.  It was ok though.  I'm glad I didn't watch it with my husband though otherwise I would have heard an endless river of yawns & sighs & mumbles of when the movie would end.

Was this Emma Thompson's first screenplay????  It was pretty good in that sense.  She looked great in this movie but a bit old when compared to Hugh Grant.  That's ok though because I would have preferred her acting over any other average 17 through 20 year-old mediocre one.

Her character was wonderful at keeping all her wits together (minus the 5 second breakdown @ the happy end of the movie, of course).  Kate Winslet was wonderful too.  Her character was a bit too quirky & dreamy for my taste but that just displays her master of the art of acting too.  MAN!  I thought I was a hopeless romantic (modern-day) but her character was just over-the-top!  I'm rather glad she ended up w/the Col. Brandon versus the equally hopeless-romantic Willoughby.  Was it mean of me to be happy that Willoughby left?  No - I thought he was too fake anyway although Marianne fell for it.  Funny, I couldn't help seeing The Sherriff of Nottinghame & worse yet Proffessor Snape when watching Alan Rickman though.  Wonderful actor but it doesn't hurt to see handsome folks on screen (of which I personally don't think Rickman is - to each their own though) but I think that made it even more believable, right?

Anyway, the screenplay was well written & this was a pretty movie.  It just wasn't one of my favorites & I don't think I'd watch it again.  Opposite to my thoughts on Pride & Prejudice w/Knightley & Macfayden.
