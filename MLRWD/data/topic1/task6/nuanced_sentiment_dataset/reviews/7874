The others who review or will review this film will cover most everything, so there isn't much left to say but to repeat (or pre-repeat "huh?") that it's a great film.
Jack is right up there with Bogart, Powell, Mitchum or any other actor or actress who ever played a gumshoe.
The cast is great, the production is great, the music is great. This might have been the best film to be seen from director Roman Polanski and it might have been one of the best scripts from writer Robert Towne. (It has been said that this is part one of his trilogy. Well we've seen one which was great, two which was boring, will we ever see three?)
Chinatown has one of the best musical scores for film ever. That score by Jerry Goldsmith, dare I say it, runs neck and neck with the much exalted score for Lawrence of Arabia by Maurice Jarre. Chinatown's score like the one for Lawrence has precisely the right notes and precisely the right feel at precisely the right time. Often, enough one can say that a good score is understated and just there below the surface of the action, well this one goes hand in hand with the screen action yet doesn't get in the way at all. The prepared piano sounds are at once novel and intriguing. The harmonics played by the strings are just what are called for.
But sort of on the down side is some of the editing which at times can be really nasty. There are also some wooden deliveries but right after you encounter something like that you get to see a great scene from classic film, so you really can't lose!
So I guess all in all the word for it still has to be GREAT!
