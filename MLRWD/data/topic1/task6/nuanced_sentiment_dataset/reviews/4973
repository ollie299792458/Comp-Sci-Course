Movie: Full of excellent performances, this story is complex, yet simply and clearly told. The pacing is perfect, and the already excellent script is brought to life beautifully by director David Fincher. 10/10.

Video: Criterion is known for stunning, true-to-filmmaker-intent video transfers, and this is no exception. Shot digitally, this movie shows none of that artificial digital flatness, and feature perfect contrast and outstanding color reproduction. The whole thing is razor-sharp, but naturally so, giving an incredibly lifelike image. 10/10.

Audio: The sound design, like that of all David Fincher films, is incredible, and this DTS-HD MA 5.1 track (I don't know why the cover says "Dolby Digital 5.1," but rest assured it is actually a DTS-HD Master Audio track) reproduces it wonderfully. The sound here is clear and enveloping, with perfect LFE output and surround activity. Dialogue and music are well-prioritized. 10/10.

Special Features: Criterion and David Fincher are both known for providing a wealth of special feature on their releases, and so it is no surprise that release features just that. A massive ammount of special features, all of which are informative and interesting. 10/10.

Overall: Yeah. Perfect. 10/10.
