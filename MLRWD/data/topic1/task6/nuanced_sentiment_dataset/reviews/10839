I was living in Baltimore, Maryland when "The Abyss" was released in theatres in August of 1989. I remember reading one critic who thought that it was better than E.T.. I found that to be true. James  Cameron has directed a masterpiece that IS a masterpiece in every sense of  the word. The awesome spectacle that this movie was didn't deserve the  awful box office it received. My theory has always been that moviegoers  were burned out with the other underwater films that had recently surfaced  such as "Deepstar Six" and "Leviathan". But this movie  is different in a lot of areas. It has a great cast, terrific special  effects and a nice story. The recent DVD edition is chock full of special  features. It's one of the very best DVD's that has rolled out of the  industry. Also, my thanks to Mr. Cameron for authorizing the "Special  Edition" version which clarifies a few areas and plot points. Batman  was correctly predicted to be the box office champ of 1989. It should have  been this film instead. "Titanic" wasn't this good!
