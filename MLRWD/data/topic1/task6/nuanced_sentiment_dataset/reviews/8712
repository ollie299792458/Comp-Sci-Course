When I first thought of viewing "Bride of Frankenstien" I was very doubtful as to how much I would enjoy the movie.  I figured that it would be boring and "oldschool" in terms of the cinema industry.
I must now confess that there are some very interesting aspects to the movie and that it is not just a monster running about with mad scientists creating mayhem (yawn, yawn).
When Frankenstein was coming about the cabin in the woods and he hears the violin music and stop because of what it evoked inside of him, and then continues to be friends with the blind occupant of the cabin, there are some interesting points being made.  Themes of seeing and being blind along with judgemental responses from the capablilty of seeing are prevalent.  It shows the animalistic side of the humans and there is a touch of irony--who really are the monsters?
Along with those lines, the end further shows how Frankenstein was perhaps more "human" than the villagers.
There is much more to this movie than what meets the eye--and an open mind is a deffinite plus for any viewers that will watch it for the first time.
I enjoyed "Bride of Frankenstein" a great deal, and I highly recommend it to any viewers.
