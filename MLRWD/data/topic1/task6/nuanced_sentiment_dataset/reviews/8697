This product is simply splendid and I believe anybody who has a genuine interest in science&fiction should have it. Since it contains 4 different films (8 if director's cut versions are also counted) which are all sequel to the one before it, a person can watch all of them at once instead of watching only one and then waiting for a year for the follow up. Apart from the movies this 9 DVD edition contains things that I didn't even know that existed. I never knew that there were comic books of "Alien" and would never knew it if I didn't purchase this item. I never knew the original storyline which suggested that the eggs in the first movie should actually be in some kind of a Pyramid instead of the spaceship that was found. Well in fact here comes the most important benefit of the product: It contains information about a museum which contained all the "Alien" puppets and all the items that were used in the movies. I'm not going to describe any more about the information embedded in it and spoil anybody's appetite for "Alien". I hope this review is useful for you and I repeat my point Quadrilogy is a must for Science&Fiction fans.
