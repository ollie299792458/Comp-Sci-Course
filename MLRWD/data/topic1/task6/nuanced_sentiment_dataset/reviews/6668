I'll admit it.  I'm a huge Reese Witherspoon fan.  I thought that the first "Legally Blonde" was fabulous.  I even briefly toyed with throwing some glamour pink into my (mostly) seriously black legal wear (I'm a lawyer, too).
My husband brought this film home one night after listening to me whine about wanting something kitschy and cute to watch after we put the little one to bed.  This was not it.
In the first movie, there's a moment or two when you think the movie could go either way - totally camp or totally bad.  It made the choice to go campy and it was worth it.  The sequel didn't make the same choice.
Clearly, the director thought that bringing back the same characters would inspire the same magic.  Nope.  Instead, it made an implausible script even more implausible.  Worse, when you thought the script couldn't get worse, it did - over and over again.
I was flabbergasted about halfway through the film.  Had Reese even read the script before she agreed to appear again?  How much money did they pay Luke Wilson for the all of about 10 minutes he appears in the film?  Sally Field must have been the subject of real life blackmail to agree to play her part...  Bob Newhart was about the only bright spot in the film (and that's saying a lot).
Whereas in the last film, I toyed with running out and getting some highlights (it seemed so liberating), I was glad to stick with my predictable brown 'do.  There are some blondes (namely this movie) that would do better to remain bottled!
