I was swept out of my feet when I saw the movie more that 20 years ago. I bought it on VHS format. When it was released on DVD I dumped the VHS and bought the DVD format, then there was a second version of the movie and here comes the sad part. It was the original director's cut of 218 minutes (read 3 hours and 38 minutes). Dump the short version and buy the complete movie. Never regretted it. And what do I see now? The Last Emperor on Blu-ray? Far out! But there's a catch. Despite the bunch of documentaries, bonus material and interviews and so on, and so on, The Criterion Collection's edition on Blu-ray offers us a 164 minutes version of the movie. That's almost an hour less than the Artisan DVD edition I own. I don't get it. If Blu-ray offers us high definition quality and 8 hours of time, why not have the whole movie on Blu-ray DVD? There's plenty of room for whatever else they want to put in. I don't know if director Bertolucci agreed or not on that, but whoever decided to mutilate and desecrate the movie in this edition is a shame and tasteless ignorant (unless it is a mistake in printing the running time information). That's why I rate it only 3 stars. If you ask me for the movie itself, it is a 5 star 2 thumbs up movie not only for the director's superb work, but also for the cast, costumes, photography, locations, script, everything. You want to know what's the movie about? There's more than enough information about it everywhere. Read some of the reviews in Amazon for instance and for the time been buy the 218 minutes DVD edition of the director's cut. And yes, I agree with everybody that says this: the DVD version is extremely poor and not enhanced for widescreen TV sets (16:9) and the Blu-ray edition is, as I already mentioned - the short version -, is also a very bad transfer.
