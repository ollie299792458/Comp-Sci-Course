I love BBC films and was very interested to watch MiddleMarch.
What a disappointment to discover that although the characters are acted well, and the storylines had promise.... the film in itself dragged terribly.
Each time there was a promise of drama, excitement, passion, intrigue....it would immediately fizzle out - or to be more descriptive - the scenes and characters would never fully reach their dramatic potential either in words or actions.  The moment was cut off, the feeling didn't come across completely - for lack of better terms, things would never climax, situation to situation.

Do not get me wrong, it was a very compelling story with different personalities of scoundrels and saints.  Dorothea is angelic and steadfast, and although the scenes with the doctor and his spoilt wife were the most "fully" dramatic in his angers and their troubles - he is still a man to be admired for how much he tried to do for others and his marriage.  There are several love stories/couples within the film - but again, none of them seem epic, heart-felt, deep or passionate.

I did try to be captivated by the movie - but one shouldn't have to try. It is a bit too slow, with not enough "UMPH" ; All the chracters were fairly developed - but lacked the connectivity to make you really care about them collectively or  be suprised how things turn out.
