Good performances in movie about hen-

pecked very popular ex-Pres. (Gene

Hackman) who is going to vacation home

after expensive divorce from ex-wife,

who decides to run for that town May-

or position when local Mayor drops dead

[not shown], to keep vacation home from

being carved up in divorce property split.

He bumps into local Handy(man) [Ray Ram-

ona], who plays surpringly wimpy, timid

character, who haas not popped the ques-

tion to grilfriend of six yrs. (!) Hack-

man asks Handyman to step aside in May-

oral race, thinking the creampuff will

role over but finds the country bump-

kin has plenty of fight when ex-Pres.

asks out Handy's girl for dinner! Red

Green fans will love role played by Red

Green reg. Wayne Robson, a canadian act-

or best known for 'Mike Hamar' role on

the popular R.G. show in Canada, which

is shown in US on PBS on selected sta-

tions around country. Marsha Harden &

vet character actor Rip Torn almost steal

this pic from Ramano and Hackman, which

is NOT a bad thing. Very Funny, underrated!

See it!
