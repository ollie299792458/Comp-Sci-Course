Being fascinated as I am with this case for years, I immediately went out to the theater to see this on day one.  Obviously, we all thought this would be the be-all-end-all Ripper flick.  Alas, we have been let down again.  The physical characteristics of the film are stunning.  An unsurpassed attention to detail dominates this feast for the eyes, but its ... historical inaccuracies don't allow anyone who's truly familiar with the case to enjoy it; Lord forbid anyone new to the story should take this as gospel.  Please, if you are wanting to learn more about this mystery, do yourself a favor & get "The Ultimate Jack The Ripper Companion" here ....  For atmosphere alone, this is worth seeing!  The extras on the second disc are o.k. considering there's not much in-depth video material out on the Ripper case (one part however mismatches the body of one victim with the name of another; a ... oversight in editing!).  If this had been done from a more historical perspective, it WOULD have been the ultimate Ripper film & I guess for now, it has to do although I much prefer the Michael Caine TV miniseries from 1988.  If anyone knows where I can purchase that flick on VHS or preferably DVD....  By the way, Johnny Depp is great as usual, though his character suffers from ... historical inaccuracy in the name of Hollywood.
