This was a one of the great horror movies of the eighties.  Unfortunately it was the last great Halloween movie made until H2O.  It contained the hallmark frightening trademarks including the eerie Halloween music.  The opening was great and it made a decent conclusion to its predecessor Halloween 4.

 However, there are a few notes of concern (which is why I rated this movie a four).  The biggest problem of all, was the end didn't really end.  I know this is common in many horror movies but this ending really really sucked.  It was almost like they were trying to give Michael Meyers a killing buddy.  Something  like a chopping and dicing duo.  Although for those who have seen the sequels following this one, you realize they really never ever explained the mysterious man or why he was ever even in the movie.  He just blows up the police station and frees Michael Meyers.  If you are going to bring in some off the wall.....(insert appropriate metaphor here), then at least bring it to conclusion in one of your sequels.

If you are a true horror fan then by all means purchase this for your library.  But prepared for the mindless slicing and dicing that is the trademark of many mass murderer horror movies.
