Yup, it`s her film and she shines all through it. As a musical production it isn`t up to much compared what they did over at Metro. But the performances survive and Marilyn`s "Diamond`s are a Girl`s Best Friend" is an eternal showstupper - just as Gene Kelly`s Singin`in the Rain, Judy`s Over The Rainbow or Julie Andrews`The Sound of Music are all magic moments in the history of the movie musicals.

Jane Russell does hold her own and Charles Coburn is a delight as well.

November 1 2005:

Since 20th Century-Fox has NEVER released this film on DVD, I have to enclose another jewel:

"I WAS AN ADVENTURESS" 1940 - a comedy-drama - starring Vera Zorina, Erich Von Stroheim, Peter Lorre and Richard Greene - is  great entertainment with Vera working as decoy for Lorre and Von Stroheim as a Countess Tanya Vronsky.

She lures rich bachelors of money and jewelry and the film(a remake of a 1938-film)is full of excellent 1-liners and the performances ARE ALL FIRST RATE!!!

Please - release this on dvd:-))))
