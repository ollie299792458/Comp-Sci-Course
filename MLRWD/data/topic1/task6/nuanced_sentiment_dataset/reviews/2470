This movie has two big problems: First, it's not really a story. It's a set of carefully-contrived CGI-generated aerial combat sequences slightly leavened by some beautiful terrain photography and I include Jessica Biel in a bikini in that category. Second, NONE of the characters, including EDI, has any depth or anything that would make them engaging and human. Every single one of the major characters could be replaced by a CGI animation and nothing would be lost.

None of this is the fault of the cast. In fact, I give full marks to Josh Lucas, Jessica Biel and Sam Shepard for *trying*, but the fact is this movie is what happens when a director has to deal with a "written and greenlighted by studio suits" script as his playbook. In the end, it's just a set of still pictures flashed on the screen at very high speed, and as emotionally flat as the screen of the product-placed Sony(rootkit) Vaio that shows up prominently in an early shot.

My advice for this is to rent the DVD once and then forget about it. After the first few minutes, after it became obvious what this thing was, I read John Dalmas' "The Lantern of God" and looked up whenever it got to the aerial combat scenes.

Also, if you're interested in how an intelligent machine might feel about and deal with its imperfect creators, I can recommend two books. 1. David Weber's "Empire from the Ashes" has Dahak, and 2. John Ringo and Linda Evans' "The Road to Damascus" has Sonny. Either one of them is better more-than-an-evening entertainment than this empty child of boxoffice-grubbing Hollywood bureaucracy.
