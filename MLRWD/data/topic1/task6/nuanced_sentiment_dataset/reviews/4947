A couple of years ago, when this film first came out on DVD I complained that it was not in "true" widescreen, only 1.85 instead of 2.35.  Then when they came out with the two-disc DVD in "2.35" I BOUGHT IT!  I discovered that it was STILL IN 1.85.  I complained to Amazon.  That was the first review I had ever written to Amazon.  Amazon chose not to show my review.  Why?, I wondered.  Still not sure.  I'll wait to see if they print this one.

Only the first few minutes--the devil in the sky section--appeared that it might turn into 2.35----it didn't.  Now I own two copies of virtually the same movie.

(I'm giving the movie three stars--not for the actual movie, which is GREAT and deserves 5 stars+----but only the DVD.)

I was so shocked to see that it STILL IS ONLY 1.85 not the 2.35 indicated by AMAZON!!!  The box doesn't even define it:  only shows "widescreen preserving the original theatrical presentation" stuff.

WHAT GIVES???  I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

If anyone out there knows what's going on, please reply! If this movie was only shot in 1.85----that's cool.  I can handle it.  BUT, if it was shot in 2.35 (as I thought it was), Houston, we have a problem!

Please respond and let me KNOW THE TRUTH!

Thanks.
