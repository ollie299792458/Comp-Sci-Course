Overall I liked the movie, The Grapes of Wrath, better then the book because it went at a faster pace and the dialogue was enhanced by the personalities that the actors gave too the characters.

However there were certain scenes cut from the movie that were crucial to the book that I would have liked to see. One example would be the Joad's dog getting run over, which symbolized the family getting run down and coming apart. Also some scenes from the book are rearranged in the movie. For example, Tom gets his face cut by a police officer and then goes into hiding. The book then ends abruptly. Whereas in the movie, Tom gets his face cut but stays with the family for another 45 minutes. In the book, there was a metaphor before every scene that foreshadowed what would happen in the events to come; those scenes are cut from the movie. For example, in the book there is a turtle who gets flipped up on his back but then gets back up. This symbolizes a country that gets knocked down but then gets back up. I would have liked to have seen more symbolism in the movie in order to provide more meaning. I liked the end of the book better because the author concluded it well by tying up all ends. In the movie, they leave you wondering.

The differences between the movie and the book are numerous but doesn't change the plot in a great way. In my opinion, the movie is better because it provided a descriptive version of the story.
