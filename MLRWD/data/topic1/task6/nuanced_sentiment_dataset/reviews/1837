Having read quite a few reviews on this movie, I realize that many of the people who have watched and reviewed this movie were just out looking for a good story, or wanted to see Robin Williams in his wonderful, comedic role.  Not that they are wrong, for this movie does provide a good measure of both.

Having viewed this movie numerous times, and having seen quite a few Robin Williams movies, I have to add here, that there is a hidden dimension to this and other Robin Williams movies.

I think that most of Robin Williams's movies contain within them a cutting, critical, social comment that can often be overlooked due to the off-beat humor and story lines.  In this particular movie, the theme is set up early on in the scene in the mental institution where he encounters the gentleman who asks him how many fingers he is holding up.  The answer to that question is the heart of the social commentary in this film, and is carried out, amplified, and experimented with through out the remainder of the scenes and subplots.  To fail to fully comprehend the social commentary in this film is to lose at least 90 percent of its meaning, leaving the viewer with nothing but a somewhat predictible, stereotyped movie with a bit of fun humor.

As a minister, this movie reminded me at a critical time, what it was that I was all about.  I have since used it to teach, and have found my students to be similarly moved when examining the intricasies of the theme.

I highly recommend this to everyone who ever will have anything to do with people care.
