definitely this one makes my top ten list,that there are now at least a hundred or two. trying to understand the dehumanization that occurred at Aushwitz,comes down to a statement by one of the characters,"We do what we have to in order to survive for the day". But in the back of the concentration camps internees an even deeper emotion is present as another prisoner says,"If this(referring to the extermination camp)war ends and this goes on I don't want to be alive". The camp inmates are all strangers to each other and the camps rulers,the Nazis,are strict to keep it that way through a policy of  select and whimsical brutality,murder,and injustice. This keeps the inmates beyond hope with the sole desire to "look out for number one". Yet despite this these complete strangers evolve a plan to blow up the gas chambers and riot in an attempt to get the information out about the death camps. Some of these scenes are really graphic so I would be careful about someome watching this without parental guidance. These total strangers become"good neighbors"and are able to surprise their tormentors in a story that makes the best horror movie seem lacking.The scenes are deadly even worse they're true.
