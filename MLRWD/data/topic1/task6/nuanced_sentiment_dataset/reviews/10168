As much as I love Idris Elba, even he couldn't save this mish-mash. The director has no sense of what a psychological thriller is comprised of. The characters are shallow giving the viewer no idea into why they act the way they do. Why is Lisa so crazy and delusional? Why did she choose Derek out of every man at the firm? What wiles did Sharon use to "gold dig" her way into Derek's bed and life? Who knows?! Beyonc&eacute; is still not good enough to carry a movie alone. As I stated for "Cadillac Records", diction training would be of benefit since her flat Texas accent always gets in her way. Usually an excellent actor, Idris overdoes every emotion here, which is the director's fault at not better defining the character.  Between them, Beyonce and Idris have the sexual chemistry of, well.....Beyonce and her husband, Jay-Z - NONE!!!  Another usually good actor, Jerry O'Connell has no real place at all.  I kept asking myself why he was there in the first place. Ali Larter probably does the best with this weak script although she just comes off as a better looking Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction". Overall, I was very disappointed with this film.
