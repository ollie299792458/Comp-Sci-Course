I have to agree with most people who feel the Fellini Toby Dammit sequence is the only reason to watch it. Vadim sets his in a medieval France populated by people dressed in left over costumes from Barbarella, which sounds like more fun than it is, the case with most Vadim films. Malle's section is simply dull, an utterly uninspiring, and rather unpleasant, version of a good horror tale. The Fellini sequence is easily the best, and also a wonderful take on Poe's story. Stamp is great as a dissolute actor on the bottom. The scenes in the airport as he arrives is some of the best stuff Fellini ever shot. These short story, omnibus film compilations were popular in Europe, and all suffered from the same flaw: the quality of the episodes was never consistent. The late attempt to do one here, NY Stories, suffered the same disability: Passable Scorsese, unwatchable Coppola (scripted by Sofia, as a child, and as talentless then as she is now), and a funny Woody Allen, put at the end, because they knew no one would watch the intolerable Coppola sequence otherwise. The Fellini is also at the end of this film, and a smiliar mindset is at work.
