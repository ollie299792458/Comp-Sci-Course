I recently decided to start watching Full House from the beginning. Not sure what prompted the decision, but so far (I'm in season two) I'm glad I did. That being said, I feel like I have been a bit disillusioned. Little is the way I remember it:

-Danny was not always a neat freak (in season two he vacuums the regular vacuum with a smaller one, but before then he does nothing like it)
-Stephanie did not say How Rude! until halfway through season one
-Jesse doesn't say have mercy until even later than that
-Even the lyrics to the theme song aren't as I remember (it turns out they changed slightly over time)

I was surprised to find the first few episodes super emotional. If anything, the premise of this comedy is shockingly depressing-Danny's wife dies, leaving him to care for his three daughters alone-but the show manages to strike a balance with this sadness by bringing in rocker musician Jesse (Danny's brother-in-law) and stand up comedian Joey (Danny's best friend).

Watching Michelle (the Olsen Twins) grow up is also fascinating. We literally see them go from silent babies to walking and talking toddlers and beyond. It is strange to see someone actually play their own age on television, which is such a rarity these days. Though they never look unhappy on the show, Mary Kate apparently regrets her childhood years on set.

I find myself appreciating DJ much more than before-she is the one who pulls in the tears most because she is the only one old enough to understand the bigger picture of what is going on. She is old enough to truly understand that her mother is gone and express those feelings. Eventually Michelle and Stephanie grow up to be a part of this story too.
