Jodie Foster plays an embittered divorcee establishing her new residence after what we are to presume was a acrimonious divorce. The opening scene has a friend encouraging her to buy an obviously expensive home in New York city - because "he can afford it". And we also learn it is her intention to go back to Columbia University. One assumes her ex will be responsible for the bills or she has been given a handsome settlement that enables her to continue with her life of trivial pursuits. 
Enter the men. Three thieves. All, naturally of course, lacking enough collective cerebral power to exit the house on finding it is occupied and coming back at another time. The only motivation to staying is possibly that they were aware of the mother's vocation as a silver spoon divorcee and knew that her schedule between tennis lessons, random weekends in the country, classes and cappuccino would be unpredictable. So why not stay and see how it goes? Duh? 
Well predictably it doesn't go well. Motivated by the impoverishing divorce where she can now only access millions of dollars instead of tens or hundreds of millions and protecting her chronically wounded daughter, the mother puts up a mythic defense against the sullying patrimony of society. Body count? All men - two dead, one captured, and one hospitalized (guess who?). Theft and Divorce karma are obviously very gender specific phenomena.
Two stars for the movie. Both for the opening credits which were stunning and thankfully had nothing whatsoever to do with the picture that followed.
