"Aileen - Life and Death of a Serial Killer" is a long, rambling look at Aileen Wuornos that was shot in the years leading up to her 2002 execution.

To me, the best part of "Aileen" is its discussion of her personal history. Whatever one may feel about Wuornos, it is tinged by sympathy after learning about her grossly-dysfunctional family. She was abandoned by both of her parents and her father committed suicide in prison. While being raised by her grandparents, she was sexually active by the age of nine and had a child at thirteen. After Aileen gave birth to the child, her grandfather threw her out of the family home and she began to support herself as a prostitute.

A huge portion of "Aileen" consists of prison interviews that filmmaker Nick Broomfield conducted with Wuornos. The interviews are a mixed bag. On the positive side, one gets unmistakable proof of Wournos' mental problems; she rants and raves about UFOs, "sonic pressure," and poison in her food. On the negative side, a lot of the ranting simply doesn't make a lot of sense and it goes on forever.

The video and audio on this film were not great. Broomfield relies on clips from media coverage of the Wuornos case to tell much of the story and those clips are often not of the best quality. Broomfield is a passionate opponent of the death penalty, but his discussion of the issue struck me as largely unoriginal.

"Aileen" is worth a look, but I cannot rate it any higher than three stars.
