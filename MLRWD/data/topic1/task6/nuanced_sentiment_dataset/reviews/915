I'm just a guy watching a movie here.  I have no special interest in this movie or any deeply analytical comments to make about it, but here is what I thought.
This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie.  Meaning?  No slapstick comedy (which is effectively entertaining in its own genre).  This movie is funny, but if it is watched solely for comedic value, the viewer will be somewhat dissapointed.
This is the story of one man, Barry Egan (I'm sure that is an anagram, but I'm too stupid to figure it out),  who can only find the strength to break out of his own neurotic life, when he finds love.
This movie is not for everyone.  It portrays a very specific emotional mindframe.  One must identify with Adam Sandler's character to feel something for the movie as a whole (which is hard becuase you keep expecting him to be the same character from his other movies like Happy Gilmore).
Overall, I found this movie to be refreshingly awkward in every way.  The movie moved at a drunken pace (I suppose I should have known that from the title).  It can test the patience of those with ADD.
I can't identify any specific element that made it a good movie for me, but it just seemed to gel together very well.  Overall, this movie is interesting, so it is worth watching, even if you don't enjoy it.
