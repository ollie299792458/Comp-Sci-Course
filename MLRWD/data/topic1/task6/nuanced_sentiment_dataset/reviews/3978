Fewer movies start out with more promise.

It is 1928 and gigantic and mysterious objects are found in the desert.

OK. I am fully engaged.

Fast forward to today. A total Egyptology nerd is shown presenting evidence supporting his (controversial) theories about the famous pyramids. The audience walks out.

The nerd, dejected, broke, and homeless, is offered a dream job by what seems an impossibility: a person who takes him seriously.

OK. I am now incredibly engaged.

Said nerd shows up at ultra-high-tech and secret facility, where in 14 days he uncovers what a phalanx of researchers missed during the previous 2 years. His discoveries lead to a revelation: an ancient stargate. A stargate!

OK. Wow. By now I am having heart palpitations. I LOVE THIS MOVIE.

Sadly, soon after the movie begins an inexorable slide into stupidity, and fully degenerates into a seen-it-a-million-times-before GO GO GO AMERICA battle. I feel sick. The scene where one of the alien kids proudly does a full military salute makes me almost puke. (As does the scene where the alien kid thinks it is cool to smoke! Did the tobacco lobby underwrite the film?)

WHEN will we as a species be able to accept the idea that meeting an alien species MIGHT be a good thing? When, if ever, will we respond with fascination, curiosity, and awe rather than guns?
