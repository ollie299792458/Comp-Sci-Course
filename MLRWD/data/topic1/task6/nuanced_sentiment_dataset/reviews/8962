This movie is a fun mix of various fairy tale references and the Zorre-esque Puss In Boots character from the Shrek films.  We basically get here the origins of the Puss character and an early adventure of his.  It has the general fun and atmosphere of the Shrek movies while having its own identity - it's full of lots of humor, but with a good adventure story to keep the plot moving.
  There are several things that this movie could've totally blown but got spot-on right.  The creators made the right move in focusing on one character from the Shrek movies in his own feature, and they definitely made the right choice of characters - Puss is likeable and amusing and has enough substance to pull of the lead role.  As a music lover, I was particularly pleased with the flamenco-ish soundtrack (featuring Rodrigo & Gabriela) that added to the overal cultural flavor, as opposed to the modern pop music of Shrek.  Similarly, the "Zorro" similarities with the title character was matched with a Mexican setting and appropriate accents (except by the annoying  American accent of Humpty Dumpty, which dind't fit in at all, and I don't remember any explanation in the movie of why someone raised from a small child in an orphanage would not have the same accent as those he grew up around).  The movie didn't try to fit in innapropriate references to characters that didn't belong (as in, for example, "Muppet Babies", where a bunch of characters we'd seen meet for the first time as adults are now seen hanging out as children).  So, you won't see Shrek or Donkey, but Puss does just fine on his own (and the movie maybe flows a little better without the increasingly over-the-top slapstick of the later Shrek films).  In fact, this movie definitely has a different feel than Shrek, with a little less of a focus on mixing modern pop-culture references with a fantasy setting, although those elements are still there.
  Definitely worth watching and I hope it spawns a series of films of its own.
