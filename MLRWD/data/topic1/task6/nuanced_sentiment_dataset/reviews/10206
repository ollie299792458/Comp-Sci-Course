I found the book in the library a month or two ago.  Soon after, I saw a listing for the movie on the TVGuide channel, and I was very surprised that a movie had been made. The book certainly doesn't read like something that would inspire a screenplay, but it does provide a lot more back story, more concentration on the mysticism of the spices, and more character development of all the 'minor' stories that come in and out of Tilo's shop.

The movie was absolutely beautiful.  The set, the costumes, the outdoor shots - everything was a pleasure to watch.  One disappointment (and I believe a major character development issue)is that in the book Tilo is 'incarnated' as an aged woman.  The young man is attracted to her none the less, and part of the temptation of the spices is for her to use them to make herself young and beautiful for him so that he will be physically attracted as well.  In the movie, Tilo is already young and gorgeous, and the guy is so head over heels that there is no tension in that regard.

I was very pleasantly surprised by the movie overall.  Even if you don't care much about the story, it is so pretty to watch that it is worth it.
