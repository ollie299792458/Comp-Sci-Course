This disc is the most anti-consumer user-hostile Blu-Ray (or DVD, for that matter) I have ever encountered. People should not have to skip through not 1, not 2, not 3 but FOUR(!!) previews to watch the movie they paid for. Not only that, but by the time you get to the main menu you'll be treated to - you guessed it - MORE ADVERTISING!!! What makes a bad situation even worse is all the other crap that you have to wade through to get to the movie. Here's what happens after you load the disc into your player:

*Progress (loading) indicator (For BD Live?)
*Animated Universal Pictures logo
*Notification that your player is "Loading a fresh preview from the internet"
*Preview 1
*Preview 2
*Preview 3
*Preview 4
*Menu asking you to select your language
*FBI Anti-piracy warning
*Disclaimer: "The views and opinions expressed in the interviews and/or commentaries are solely of the individuals..."
*MPAA rating
*Disclaimer: "Availability of network-related features subject to change..."
*Animated BD logo
*Apollo 13 Main menu (displaying ads for other Universal BD movies, the "ticker")

This is the kind of consumer-hostile design which turns people to download movies from the internet. When I load a movie into my player, I want to be taken directly to the main menu with a minimum of fuss. I paid for convenience and I didn't get it. Had I known this disc was authored this way, I would not have purchased it. Help discourage this kind of behavior by NOT purchasing this disc.
