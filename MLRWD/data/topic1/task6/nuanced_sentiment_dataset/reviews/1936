Now, having a terrible, terrible guilty pleasure that is the "teen movie" genre, I am normally a rave reviewer of these films.  I did not like this movie.  I liked the cast, I liked the idea, but I just couldn't get in to the movie. 
Jason Biggs plays "Paul Tannek," a transplant from the sticks, who is awkward in his New York City surroundings.  Mena Suvari plays "Dora Diamond," the "independent thinker" who is having an affair with the Greg Kinnear character, Professor Alcott. 
This is the preverbal "root for the little guy" kind of film.  Paul Tannek is a little geek  falls in love with the girl, Dora, who is already taken. And worse yet, the girl is love with the big, mean professor, who doesn't really care about her.  Paul does his best to steer the girl away from the professor, while not trying to show how sleazy the professor really is.  He plays this wonderfully chivalrous guy, who is completely annoying, not very funny, and downright boring.  
Boredom was probably the main downfall to this movie.  There was a pretty hefty lack of plot.  Where you would expect more conflict to begin, it did not.  Where there should have been drama, there was not. . . Where there was supposed to be a movie, there was not.  There was a great deal of potential in this movie, as the cast was strong, but the movie fell flat.
