This movie is not as good as the book but it is still a very worthwhile film to see.  It is beautifully filmed and the racing scenes made me a horse racing fan.  I had alway been bored by horse racing on TV and thought I would be by the racing scenes in the film but they were done in such a way that it seemed you were on a horse in the race and really brought home the danger, drama and excitement of the race.
The true story of Seabiscuit has so much heart to it that you can't help but be moved by this movie but the book has so much more heart and soul to it than the film and it gives the complete and accurate story.  Some things in the film were changed a little for dramatic effect.
This movie is not the great film it could've been but its many good points even out the flaws.  And it is a film for everyone, not just horse lovers.  It is not about horse racing, it is about an amazing, spirited, underdog horse finally meeting people who understood him and allowed him to be his best.
No one will regret giving this film a try.
But read the book and watch the PBS documentary.
