I do not own this movie on bluray or DVD but I do have it on VHS. The only reason I have this movie at all is I got involved in a video club many years ago and it was free. This movie has only one plot, turn gunfighting into a sport. That's it! A couple of hours (not sure how long the film is since I've only wathed it once) of two people standing in the street shooting at each other. The one that looses is dragged off and another one steps up. Terrible! Those that know history know that gunfights in the old west was not as prevailent as in the movies for a couple of reasons. First, you could die, second, guns were not very acurate, third, ammo was expensive. I love westerns for the stories they tell about life back then but this dog has none of that. I've tried to give this movie away several times and thought I was sucessful a couple of times but it always came back mysteriously. If you love westerns, stay way from this one!!! The only reason I gave this movie one star is because I couldn't give it the negative 5 stars it deserves!!
