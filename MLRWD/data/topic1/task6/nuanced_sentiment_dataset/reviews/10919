This had the potential to be a 5 star all the way. I loved the display of mixed martial arts. I loved the settings and the actors. It's just that, the number of fights we're lacking. In fact Donnie Yen only fought two bad guys in this one. The last fight was awesome, and the other one wasn't a good fight at all. It ended fast and the other guy was manhandled by Donnie Yen. Then there was some good gunplay at the end. But when a movie goes off and I'm just expecting something else to happen, it shows that the movie really didn't fill my appetite.

I finally came to give this a 3 after watching it a couple more times. If this movie would've had a couple more fight scenes that we're impressive, it could have easily earned a 5 star from me. It was less of an action film and more of a drama film. Just a bad balance between action and drama to me.

As any other kung fu or action film that falls short of a 4 or 5, I trade it back in. I wish this movie we're better so I wouldn't have to do that. But I have no choice. My opinion on this movie is it's worth a rental and watch. After that it's no use to keep it around.
