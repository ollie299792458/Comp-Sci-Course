What a joy to experience a wonderful ballet with really good dancing and a really good musical score. Not the musical claptrap of Le Corsaire, Bayadere or Fille mal Gardee. From it's premiere in Paris in 1876 to it's major revival in 1952 by Frederick Ashton at The Royal Ballet in London all critics have praised the music as well as the dance. The story line is thin and without even the drama of Giselle but the dancing is totaly entrancing. This is more or less a one women show. Sylvia is on stage almost all the time and the choreography is very difficult. The lilting pizzacata valse, a joy to behold, is very complicated and takes an extremely talented ballerina to execute. The original Ashton star was Magot Fonteyn, one of the greatest artist of all time. It thus takes the athleticism and brilliant technique of Darcy Bussell to carry this role off and she does. (She is everwhere these days even a stint the TV production of the Vicar of Dilby). There is not one movement in the whole show that was not right on and she was matched by the rest of the cast. Her partner Aminta is the very handsome Roberto Bolle (one of the few danseurs that is taller than she is). He looks like he could be a quarterback on an NFL football team but is quite graceful on his feet. My favorite was the moustache twirling Thiago Soares as the bad boy Orion. What a delight! and what a delight is the whole show.
