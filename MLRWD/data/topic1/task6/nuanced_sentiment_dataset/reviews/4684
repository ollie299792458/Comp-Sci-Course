Wonderful movie.  Deeply touch my heart.
The title of my review is the thought that ran through my mind when as I watched the movie.
It is at its heart a Christian movie at a time in history when Christians across the globe are being persecuted, jailed, and killed for the simple act of professing their belief in Christ.
I highly recommend this movie to everyone willing to open their heart, feel the truth, and/or willing to be touched by God and Christ.
I acknowledge that after watching this movie I did open my heart to Christ and allow him into my life and heart.  He also removed the hard stone from my heart.

Instead, I recommend seeing this movie and letting your heart open to its truth.
Definitely worth buying!  And sharing with your friends and loved ones.  Just don't expect everyone to be as deeply touched.  One must be ready first.
