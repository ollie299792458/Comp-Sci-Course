I read in the NY Times that John C. Reilly is playing Stanley Kowalski in a production of "Streetcar Named Desire."  Stanley?  Mitch, maybe, but never Stanley.  Not that Reilly isn't a terrific actor.  He's proved himself in a series of scene-stealing supporting roles in films like "Hard Eight" and "Boogie Nights."  He just doesn't have the heft of a Brando.  But I like him fine as Karl Malden.  He plays a Malden-sized character in "Criminal," a first film by Gregory Jacobs, the assistant director on the "Oceans" films.  And that's the problem.  This is the kind of preposterous "heist" film (apparently based on an Argentinian original) that requires a willing suspension of disbelief.  Maybe if it boasted the eye candy (not to mention the heft) of a George Clooney in the lead role, and, instead of Diego Luna and Maggie Gyllenhaal, Benecio Del Toro and Julie Roberts in support, you'd be willing to overlook the holes in the screenplay.  As it is, you aren't likely to find any of these characters evil or glamorous enough to care what happens to them.  Instead, you'll be left to marvel that two such small-timers as Richard (Reilly) and Rodrigo (Luna) might even get close to a "sting" on the scale of the one outlined here.  That said, I certainly like Diego Luna as an actor and wish him well in his career.  He was terrific in "Y Tu Mama Tambien."  Maggie Gyllenhaal, too, has done better work.  And John C. Reilly gives it all he's got.  He certainly makes a convincing louse.  But he needs to go back to playing Mitch, and leave Stanley to the Brandos.
