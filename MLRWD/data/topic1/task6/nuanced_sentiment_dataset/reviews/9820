I am a huge sucker for British accents, so I went to see this movie the first week it premeered in theaters. Since I have no cable television, Amanda Bynes is a new face for me. Colin Firth is quite convincing as Lord Henry Dashwood, and Bynes, although forced to make some typical American mess-ups as the script mandates, does an admirable job as the young, impetuous, but ultimately caring, good-hearted heroine. I have to say, though, that the best character for me was Oliver James, not because of his acting abilities, which were not thoroughly explored, but his singing voice needs to get more credit. In truth, he should release an album over here in the States. Those two songs on the soundtrack just don't give me enough! Speaking of the soundtrack, I love how they used "I Wanna be Bad"! I wish they had played the entire song during the film! The caniving, devious step-sister and mother, (rather like Cinderella, don't you think)? are decent as well, and the grandmother is extremely funny in the little screen time she is given. I'd actually recomend this, if only for the British actors, and Amanda Bynes's cute, charming, if a bit chiche, performance.
