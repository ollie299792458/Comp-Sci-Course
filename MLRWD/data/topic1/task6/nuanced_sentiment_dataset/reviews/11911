"Incredibly True Adventures" is a great coming-of-age-as-a-lesbian movie. It's easy to relate to because many of us can identify very closely with the circumstances of these girls' lives. It makes sense that a lot of young lesbian know, and love, this film.
On the first viewing, it provides plenty of giggles, suspense, and the sense of belonging that questioning teens can get from a movie like this. I, for one, felt a lot better after I watched this at 16. Now that it's been a while, it's just cute. The love scenes are great if you're in it for the sweetness, neither of the girls are that attractive, and it kind of seems like the femme one will eventually cast off her new lifestyle. Viewing a lot of other lesbian flicks made this one, therefore, seem average in a lot of ways. My friends and I own this, but it very rarely gets pulled off the shelf. It's absolutely worth watching, but don't be in a rush to buy it.
Bottom Line:
Cuddles: ****
Tissues: *
Hotness: **
Laughs:  ***
Quality: ***
If a friend owns it, they won't mind letting you borrow it.
