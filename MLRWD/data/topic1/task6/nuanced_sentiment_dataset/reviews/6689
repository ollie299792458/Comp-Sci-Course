This is a great epic film. I have watched it many many times & went to the picture show to see it way back when it first came out in the early sixties. The price of $ 41.99 is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. The price should be around the low $20.00 range. Technology has changed so much the last few years. When these films are ran on TCM, the quality is absolutely excellent mint condition. I don't need a cover. No Big Deal! I will just record it on my DVD Recorder & it will cost me about only 20 cents to do it. Whoever buys this film & pays $41.99 for it, more power to you, but you are a FOOL! I need my cash to pay bills! By the way, I purchased the DVD of this film from Wal-Mart a couple of year ago for only $7.50. That's a heck alot cheaper than $41.99-- The running time is 155 Minutes. The running time of this collectors set is 162 Minutes. This is only 7 little Minutes longer. If you get down to the bottom line-The Nitty Gritty--The Great Epic El-Cid on DVD-The Collectors Edition just came out recently-(Released) & you can purchase it at tons of places & pay anywhere from around $17.99 to the low $20's. In my opinion, This film "How The West Was Won" should be around the same price as El-Cid!
