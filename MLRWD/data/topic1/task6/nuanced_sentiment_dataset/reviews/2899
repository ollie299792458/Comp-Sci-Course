I ended up with this film believing it to be a hard boiled Noir style film similar to Bound.  The main character acts like a hard boiled detective for sure, but the seriousness is way over the top.  In the beginning of the movie Brendan isn't even sure there is a "The Pin" and doesn't know what a "Tug" is.  The suspense element of the "not knowing" about them is lost as the cover of the DVD clearly shows that "The Pin" and "Tug" exist and who they are.

Other issues I had with the movie are that at the end it is assumed the audience, me, picked up on stuff that wasn't even shown during the movie, like how the girl died, what ailment Brendan has and/or how he got it.  Also based on the context it seems that the code names for certain groups changes through the movie.  At one point "The Bulls" is obviously one group, but at the end of the movie is used as a reference for a completely different group. huh?

This film wasn't a total waste, the scene at the principles office was pretty tight, the parking lot scene(s) were amusing.  I suggest you rent or flix it instead of purchasing it...make your play!
