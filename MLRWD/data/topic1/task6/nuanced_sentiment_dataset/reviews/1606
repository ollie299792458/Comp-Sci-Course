Well, disney, you might actually be catching on. . . The DVDalso has a "bounus" not advertised on the front-- you don'thave to sit through 10 minutes of commercials before you watch the movie.  The DVD takes you straight to the menu and has more features than almost any other movie I've purchased yet.  Some favorites-- Descriptive TheaterVision-- Tony Goldwyn (Voice of Tarzan) narrates the movie for the blind or visually impaired, Animation process demonstration-- uses multiple angle feature to interactively switch between four stages of the animation process.  Storyboard/Film comparison shows two frames of the movie-- the storyboard reel and below the final film so you can compare the similarites.  Three abandoned sequences from early in the movie's production-- very cool...  And nothing beats the visual quality of the direct visual transfer.  The blues have never been so blue and the greens have never been so green.  Compared to the DVD releases of Hercules and Mulan, which were not direct digital transfers, this movie shines!  And to hear the score in 5.1 Dolby Surround is a thing of beauty.  Disney-- if you're listening-- keep putting out these collector's editions-- and we'll keep buying them!
