This movie started out with a bang, but too much was revealed in the beginning about the death of Craven's (Gibson) daughter. After that, the movie dragged while Gibson sought revenge on those who murdered her. To keep their secret, the government bad guys murdered everyone who spoke with Gibson...which lead me to question why they didn't just kill Gibson, thus burying their nuclear secret forever. Even the daughter's involvement in this government top secret plot made no logical sense to me.

There was one scene where a young woman revealed secrets to Gibson in his car. Immediately upon opening the car door and stepping into the street, a vehicle racing 100 miles an hour down the street plowed into her. No accident. The driver intended to kill her. How did he know the exact split-second she would step into his path? Ridiculous.

Mel Gibson's accent grated on my nerves. Sometimes it was overbearing. Sometimes it wasn't even present. At times he reminded me of a Bronx mob boss.

The ending was stupid and sappy. I didn't waste my time watching the alternative ending and deleted scenes. The entire movie qualified for deletion.
