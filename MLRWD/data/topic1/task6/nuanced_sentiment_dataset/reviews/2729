For the most part, the film is pretty enjoyable. A story about a big girl who becomes the queen of teen society is endearing to all misfits, and I was surprised to find myself enjoying Zac Efron, after being over-exposed to the guy from his HSM fame.

This film does have a couple things that I found irksome, however:

1)John Travolta's casting. Enda has always been played to be very hefty and not at all attractive, which makes her transformation all the more shocking. But with Travolta...well, he's a very beautiful man already, so when Edna goes to clean herself up, it's like..."Eh," was my reaction.

2)Speaking of him, it seems like TPTB changed the plot to give him (and Christopher Walken by extension) more screen time, to the detriment of the story. The whole subplot of Mrs. Van Tussle trying to seduce Mr. Turnblad just felt so...forced.

3)The Ending: I thought the original ending of Mrs. Van Tussle being offered to be the spokeswoman for AfroGlo in the musical (thus having to choose to show her bigotry if she were to decline) was funnier than her just being fired from the studio when she gets caught switching votes. And I say this as a black woman who loves seeing irony more than political correctness.

Also, how the hell did they get rid of the "Cooties" song. The roach scene in the original movie was one of the most memorable scenes!

On the plus, I liked Nikki Blonski and Amanda Brynes, and the musical numbers that were added into the movie added to the story they were going for (particularly, "The New Girl in Town," as a nod to how many songs writing by Black artists were given to white singers to sell more records). And Queen LAtifah rocked it.

Overall, if one hasn't seen the Broadway version, you'll not likely to be bothered by the changes they made. But even so, it's still worth watching.
