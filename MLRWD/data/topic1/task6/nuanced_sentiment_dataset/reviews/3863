When I heard Peter Jackson would be helming The Lord of the Rings trilogy, I knew it was in good hands, and that's based only on his work on HEAVENLY CREATURES. Jackson and Walsh was robbed of the Best Original Screenplay in 1995, the *only* Oscar nod this wonderful movie received.
HEAVENLY CREATURES was my favorite film of 1994. At the time, the "hype" was about the girls' "homosexuality". This completely missed the point. HEAVENLY CREATURES takes the true life story of murder and turns it into an engrossing and exasperating portrait of deep true love, love that defies all, love that shifts the world around you, love that most "lovers" never achieve. Despite the deadly outcome, one is envious of the love between these two girls. It is love that is exhuberant and defiant. The kind of love one can only dream to experience once in a lifetime.
The imaginary world of Pauline and Juliet is beautifully realized. The use of special effects is subtle and delightful, a true embedding of FX in the service of story and not because it "looks cool".
Since we know what the ultimate outcome is from the very beginning, the film doesn't play an "ah-ha". Instead it is all about showing us what is within the minds of these two girls and the relentless approach of the inevitable that drives the movie. 
To echo what another reviewer said, HEAVENLY CREATURES is one of the few films that really stuck with me. Driving home in the dark, I kept muttering to myself 'Oh my god...' I was emotionally drained for several days afterward.
