For starters- let me say that I am a shallow movie-goer.  I love chick flicks and comedy. I didn't even chuckle once during this movie! I was bummed I missed out in seeing this movie in theatres- now I am grateful that I didn't waste the $20... What went wrong? The movie was 2 slow hours, painfully predictable, cheesy acting (ok, Jack Black and the old guy were a bit charming), boring plot- it took 20 minutes to even start the movie. Ok so the 2 gals switch homes to mend their poor broken hearts (the men they were in love with were cheating... what a new concept!) The two men they fall in love with while on vacation have their own bagage (one is dating someone else who ends up cheating and the other has 2 daughters) Then the girls have to decide - do they stay or move back home without their new loves? Are you kidding me?

Cameron Diaz can't cry but then sheds a tear at the end of the movie when she realizes she's in love... she does a cheezy dance scene, Kate Winslet does a cheezy dance scene with the pillow as a guitar... C'Mon!

Trust me, this movie isn't worth being classified as a chick flick.
