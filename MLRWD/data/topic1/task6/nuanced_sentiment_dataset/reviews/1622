This film is pretty much only bearable if you're playing a Bruce Campbell drinking game or you're under the age of five.  The cheesiness factor of the previous Herbie flicks has been taken to the upteenth level, and several takes of the Bruce Campbell/Alexandra Wentworth dialogue are painful to watch as it appears that the performers were reading cue cards off camera.  The "race" looks like it has been filmed at twenty'five miles per hour, and the CGI has not aged particularly well.

But, that's the bad.

This film also has enough good in it to make it a fun romp for viewing once or twice:

-The 50's "Frankenstein" sequence is classic and stylish, nicely done and just silly enough.

-Horace (the evil black bug) is awesome.  I had a chance to poke under the hood of this car at a shop in Pasadena and let me tell you, it's one of the coolest bugs I've ever seen.  I can't imagine how they could have made a cute volkswagen even more evil-looking without chopping the top and performing an animal sacrifice in the trunk.

-Also, Kevin O'Connor's eyes bulge very well.
