From a special effects standpoint, this is the best rendition I've seen. From every other standpoint, it's the worst. I barely made it through the whole movie. Far too much of Lewis Carroll's dialog was changed to "Americanize" it, and the beautiful, nonsensical dialog was what made the book.

It was a mixture of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. There was plenty of wonderful content in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland to make a whole movie, so I'm not sure why they chose to mix in elements from the other book. They added scenes that weren't from the book, and changed some of the best dialog on the scenes they included.

I've been a Lewis Carroll fan for 35 years, and I have every video version of this movie, and all his books, including his non-fiction, so I'm probably a little more aware of all the mistakes in this movie than some would be. I will say that it's a nice movie for kids or anyone else who has never read and loved the books like I do. But, to me, it was very disappointing.
