This DVD contains only the 16 episodes from 1976, which some people think of as Season 1 of "The Scooby Doo Show". As a Scooby Doo aficianado I can say that this newest installment from Hanna Barbera is a "good enough" addition to a Scooby collection.  I think I must have enjoyed the cartoons more as a child; they don't seem to hold up well to repeat viewing now. Arguably, the Scooby/Dynomutt Show was a weak Saturday morning addition, even in my fond recollections, primarily because Dynomutt and Blue Falcon are so fricking annoying. But it is a nice walk down memory lane, and you can skip over the Dynomutt episodes anyways.

For those who are concerned about the "missing" 24 episodes from 1977 and 1978, sixteen of them (from 1978) will be released on the up-coming "Scooby Doo, Where Are You? Series 3". No word on the 8 episodes from 1977.

I think the confusion is coming in because there were 40 episodes that were generally thought of as falling under the name "The Scooby Doo Show", but in fact they were actually broadcast as:

(1) "Scooby/Dynomutt Hour" (16 episodes- 1976, plus 16 Dynomutt episodes, as originally televised)  **available**

(2) "All Star Laff-a-Lympics" (8 episodes - 1977)  **not released to DVD**

(3) "Scooby Doo, Where are you?" (16 episodes - 1978) **soon to be released to DVD**
