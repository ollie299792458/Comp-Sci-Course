I do agree with the high rating of this movie because it is one of the scariest, creepiest, horror films I have ever seen.  HOWEVER, I say that as someone who is terrified of clowns and anything having to do with them.  If you are scared of clowns, this movie is a frightfest that will keep you glued to your seat. (Under the safety of the nearest blanket as well, and all closet doors locked.)  If you are not really "moved to chills" by clowns then this one might not hit the mark for you.  It's an interesting watch to say the least.
My only problem with the movie (and with Stephen King's writing as a whole) is that it doesn't end well.  It's almost like the man gives everything he has to 90% of the book and then drops the ending.  He seems to do this with a lot of books, and those bad endings translate into bad movie endings.  
My recommendation?  I always tell people that they will love the first 2-3 hours of it, but in all honesty they can skim through the last hour or so of the movie.
