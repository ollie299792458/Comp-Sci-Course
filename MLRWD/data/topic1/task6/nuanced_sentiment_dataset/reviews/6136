I love parodies and 50s shlock sci-fi films, so the customer reviews really had me looking forward to seeing this movie. I haven't smoked pot since the 1970s, but I don't think even the finest Columbian gold of that time would have made me laugh at this turkey.
Yeah, they mostly get the look and dumb dialogue right, but the writers depend entirely on the look and dumb dialogue for the humor. That's the original film's job! The satirist's job is to take it to the next level. The folks who created this mess obviously have a real affection for the genre, and I appreciate that. Unfortunately, they have no comedic ability whatsoever that I can see. The actress playing the squirrel was the only inspired thing I could find in this train wreck.
For an original 50s shlock sci-fi film that is also a contemporaneous parody of it's own genre, take a look at 'Invasion of the Saucer Men.'
Now, if all of you folks who talked me into buying this sucker will chip in a quarter apiece to reimburse me for my purchase, I promise not to destroy your puny planet!
