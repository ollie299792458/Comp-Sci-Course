The romantic comedy genre is pretty generic this day and age and Two Weeks Notice does little to break the mold, but is better than the usual. What praise that can be given to the film is due to the stars, Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant, who work well together to salvage what they can from the generic story and lifeless direction. The duo seem have a decent chemistry and the least you can say about them is that they work.
Bullock is Lucy, a liberal legal aide who puts up the good fight for the little guy in the fight to slow development, while Grant plays George, a leader in the high priced NYC development game who the very ideal person Lucy fights against. He needs a new lawyer that happens to be female and a non-bimbo and, as Lucy happens to fit the criteria, they strike a deal in that he'll attempt to save her community center if she'll agree to work for him. They hate each other, of course, and they're falling for each other w/o knowing it, of course, and they get separated just as they are falling in love, of course, and they are brought back together and love meets them in the middle, of course. Aren't clich&eacute;s lovely? 
But at least it meets the minimum requirements that the lead characters be somewhat likable, and they are definitely that. The story is workable at best, but the actors made due with what was available. Romantic comedy fans are sure to love it while the rest of us our sure to make it through without suffering too much pain.
