While many loyal PBS Mystery fans wait in desperation for quality interpretations of Christie, Sayers, etc., novels, if producers are going to film them, they should do justice to the books, and then when PBS sells the tapes/CD's, they should be the full-length version.
VERY DISAPPOINTING that a crucial scene, the purchase and ultimate destruction of a chess set, was omitted from the tape.
Thoses scenes are paramount catalysts in the relationship between Lord Peter and Harriet Vane. I could not believe that it was deleted!

Also, if "they" are going to produce the works of Agatha Christie, don't chop them up and squeeze them into a ridiculous ninety minutes.
Cat Among the Pigeons was one of my favorite Christie's, and the recent version was ridiculous.  There was a much better version years ago and I cannot locate it.
I don't know why PBS cannot seem to realize that there is a vast audience for (Masterpiece) Mystery! Is there no real vision by the Powers That Be?
Better than nothing, but it's a mystery to me why we get shortcut versions. They need to be two hours in length in order to do justice to the great works. They will say, of course, money...but I think other genres are simply favored by the decision makers.
