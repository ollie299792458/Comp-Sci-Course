It was a long time ago ( too long), but I have such fond memories of the miniseries. I had seen Sam Elliott in "Lifeguard" just before this and thought it was great. When my dad( Peter S.Fischer ) said he cast Mr. Elliot in the main role, I knew it would be a quality work. My father was hired to adapt the book into a 9-hour script. A daunting task, but he pulled it off masterfully. I think it may have been the best production he ever did.
In 2009, he came out of retirement to write two novels, which are political thrillers that try not only to entertain,. but to try to show people the dangerous direction this country is going. I consider "The Blood of Tyrants"" and the "Terror of Tyrants" must reads for all Patriots who love this country and the freedom it represents.
