I'm reading all of these reviews, and I can't believe how positive they all are! I guess if you've never worked out before or want some light exercise then this will be fine, but otherwise don't expect too much. Here are my issues:

- Working out with yourself as an avatar instead of following the movements of an on-screen coach was too weird for me -- there's a lag in the action between you and what your cartoon self does, so it doesn't really move with you. You're even supposed to try to make it look like you, which I found slightly creepy.

- There are several times during the workout when you're told to keep still when you're not moving at all, and it won't proceed until you hold still for about thirty seconds. Kind of kills the whole "cardio" flow.

- There's no stretching or real warmup/cooldown. There's a jerky kind of walk/jog on a track at the beginning which I guess could be interpreted as such, but didn't work for me.

- There are very few low-impact exercises available. I have a bad Achilles tendon and can't jog. I opted out of as many exercises as I could, but when told to break into a jog from a walk, I just ended up shaking the nunchuk in my hand to make it think I was running. The exercises that remained weren't very cardio-challenging (even set to their hardest), and there was WAY too much fussing with the band and holstering/unholstering the nunchuck between exercises.

- The resistance band is way too weak. I ended up using my own, which was much stronger.

- Cardio boxing? Please. Even set at the highest level, you punch at the targets so slowly you could get coffee in between!

- It offers a "customized workout" option to design yourself, but this, too, was disappointing because it pauses between each exercise -- there's really no way to maintain an elevated heart rate and have a truly successful cardio workout with this.

Bottom line, I was looking for something WAY more challenging, and actually feel like this was a waste of money. I was looking for something to supplement My Fitness Coach (which also has some issues, but overall takes a much better approach and makes you work a lot harder over time), and this just didn't fit the bill, sorry.

But just so I'm not 100% negative, the in-line skating was fun and more difficult than expected. Hard on the Achilles, but definitely challenging.
