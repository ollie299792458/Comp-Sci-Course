I honestly enjoyed the new version of Freaky Friday.  The original was a classic from my childhood, but the remake is a more then suitable replacement.
The storyline is simple and predictable as a typically self-absorbed teenage girl and her overworked mother switch places to see how the other half lives.  This is thanks to a magic fortune cookie delivered by an elderly Chinese woman who was just trying to help them.  Unfortunately this switch occurs two days before the mother's wedding and the day before her daughter has a major honors test at school.  From the minute this occurs, we know that each character will mature before the end of the show and will help the other in a way they didn't think was possible.  It does happen, but it was sure fun to watch.
This is a great movie if you're looking to simply let your mind guy and be entertained.  It succeeds and the lead roles are perfectly acted to make us care what the outcome will be.  I highly recommend this film.  It's one that you can truly enjoy with your family.
