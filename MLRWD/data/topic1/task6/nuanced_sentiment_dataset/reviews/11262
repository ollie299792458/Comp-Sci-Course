Impromptu is a amusing and clever portrayal of the 19th century love affair between composer Frederic Chopin and French romance author George Sand, the pen name of baroness Aurore Dudevant.

George Sand is so captivated by the music of composer Fredric Chopin that she falls in love with him and pursues him relentlessly, while fighting off several other male suitors. In her desperate quest to win his affections, she boldly invites herself to the country home of a wealthy art patron (Emma Thompson) where other leading figures of the period are also guests. It is in this setting that we are treated to the hysterical antics of these love sick characters. Everything that can go wrong does! Finally Sand captures Chopin's attentions, but he is not immediately impressed with her. Eventually, he becomes as captivated with her gift of prose as she is with his music, and they fall in love. However, it is clear that Sand is the one who wears the pants in the relationship, literally and figuratively. She completely domintaes the relationship, but is nevertheless proves herself a loyal and loving companion. Her momentary lapse into femininity is soon replaced by the cross-dressing, cigar-chomping personality she is so well known for.

Impromptu is a tender love story laden with slapstick-style comedy.  Everything about this movie is pure, unadulterated fun -- the characters, their madness, and the antics of George Sand as she seeks to secure Chopin's affection. What a blast! Have fun with this one.
