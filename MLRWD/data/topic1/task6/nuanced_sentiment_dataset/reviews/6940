Ahhhh the benefits of star power. Marky Mark Wahlburg, so promising in "Boogie Nights" fell back to earth in "Planet of The Apes" and now gets his romantic lead turn in the Cary Grant role in "The Truth About Charlie". He gets top billing and is probably the only reason this Jonathan Demme project got the green light, but no doubt about it Thandie Newton and the incomparable soundtrack are the real stars here. Newton, last seen as Tom Cruise's main squeeze in "Mission Impossible 2" is everthing someone in the Audrey Hepburn role should be: frail, beautiful, flawless complexion, a damsel in distress in need of saving. Enter Markie Mark and a bunch of other unsavory characters who want to know where here dead husband Charlie's stolen 6 million in diamonds are. Demme is a talented filmmaker, and he tries some new things here, stepping outside the box, going beyond the third wall of filmmaking, but this movie is nothing more than a little chocolate truffle, made to melt in your mouth immediately with no lingering thoughts. Tim Robbins is a waste in a menacing supporting role. But as I said, the other star is the brilliant soundtrack. Demme uses the music of Paris wonderfully, casting the mood of the City of Lights with every measure. Buy the soundtrack, watch the original "Charade" on the flip side of this disc and enjoy some amour!
