Behind Enemy Lines is a good action movie. The story is about a flight navigator(Owen Wilson) looking more than a usual recon pilot mission. One day while flying over a certain war torn area, his plane gets shot down and suddenly life turns upside down while he tries to get back to his ship. You'll get to see Owen Wilson perform in not the usual romantic-comedy kind of roles and Gene Hackman is at his usual best as Owen's commanding officer - dealing with politics to get Owen out of his situation. Best to watch the movie to know more.
The video quality of the Blu ray is razor sharp with a 1080p transfer. Certain scenes such as the ship's cafeteria where the pilots have their meal is pretty detailed. When the scene shifts to enemy territory, overall look is cloudy and overcast, but that does not dampen the image quality. The Audio quality is something really different. Behind Enemy Lines bluray comes with an rocking DTS HD MA 5.1 soundtrack that will definitely put your surround system to test. Whether its the flying jet scenes or the explosive rigged sequences in war torn Bosnia, the audio never lets you down. All in all, an enjoyable experience.
