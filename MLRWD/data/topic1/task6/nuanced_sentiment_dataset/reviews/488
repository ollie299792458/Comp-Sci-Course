Derek Jarman's Caravaggio is an interesting film that focuses on the life of baroque painter Michaelangelo de Caravaggio. the movie begins with Caravaggio lying on his deathbed being tended to by a servant or possibly lover.  its told thru flashbacks from the moment he begins painting until the time he dies.  He painted many famous paintings and in one scene he meets Ranuccio Thomasoni( played by the always brilliant Sean Bean). Caravaggio hires Ranuccio to model for him and starts to fall in love with him.  there are some particularly odd scenes between the two men including one where caravaggio hands ranuccio a gold coin to hold while he paints him. Ranuccio sticks the coin in his mouth, Caravaggio gives him another. He does it again. Ranuccio continues to do this until his mouth is full of gold coins that he can't stuff them in anymore.  Caravaggio puts a coin in his mouth and he takes it with his teeth.

  overall this is a pretty good movie but the reason why i am only giving it 3 stars is because of its vagueness and the fact that this is a film that most Sean Bean fans might not like because he doesn't really play a total villain or an action hero.  Yes there is a scene where he does kiss a man (Ranuccio is a bisexual).  Well im not going to give away the entire movie but lets just say things don't work out too well for Ranuccio toward the end. If u love art it is something u should see.
