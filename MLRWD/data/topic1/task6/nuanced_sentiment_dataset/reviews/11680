If it were possible I would give this film a negative 3 in review as for it is truly a bastardization of everything that makes Trek. The story/screenplay seems like it was written by tree-hugging hippies or enviromentalist extremists with a touch of utterly absurd and boring comedy. Let's put Shatner and the crew travelling back to the 20th century 80's decate and have them save humpback whales so a probe from an unknown place doesn't destroy our planet. Gee, I wonder how much weed these guys smoke before writing this [sarcasm] appealing [/sarcasm] story. If the entire screenplay were written on toilet paper I wouldn't consider cleaning myself with it because it would probably infest me. The touch of comedy only makes this an extremely pathetic film and one that should have never existed. I hate this film so much that I have all other 9 Trek films (up to Nemesis) and I never intent on buying this movie even if it came on a "Widescreen Director's Cut DVD Unlimited Edition for $2.99".

Final Note: Apparently this film is very popular among non-trekkies and people who don't appreciate true science fiction so if you are one of them you might mildly enjoy this film, however this is NOT Trek, it should HAD NEVER BEEN, and let's all try to live thinking in our minds that this crap never existed.

Remember now: there are 9 Star Trek films NOT 10 :).
