Saw this movie last night, well, early this mornin' on German TV - don't think I'd heard of it - some big-name 70's fellers here (Mr O'Neal, Mr Dern) - it's mainly a battle of wills - the extraverted, outwardly confident/brash Detective (Dern's role) & Driver (O'Neal's), a character who has little to say, and doesn't say it... And then there are some 3rd rate thugs who are supposed to help Detective get Driver arrested - one set of scenes I found personally very touching, involved Los Angeles' Union Station (train station) and an actual train sequence (with the train leaving the station, a search on the train) - was reminiscent of one of my all-time favorite films, The Silver Streak, which came out 2 yrs. before this movie - perhaps the director doffing his cap to that feature...(?)... --- in any case, I highly recommend this feature - offers inner and outer tension (ie, psychological and visible, such as the indeed well choreographed car chase scenes) - Long Live the Year 1978... (I was 10) *G*
