I recently became enamored with Gerard Butler and began collecting movies that he had been in. I also enjoy horror movies. I figured that Dracula 2000 would be a perfect synthesis of these two interests. It wasn't.

I was a bit disappointed with Dracula 2000, which is surprising, given that my expectations weren't very high to begin with. I tend to like Wes Craven's work, and was a big fan of the Scream movies. However, while Scream's humor keeps it from feeling like a trashy horror movie, Dracula 2000 has no such saving grace.

The story is well conceived, and includes an interesting twist regarding Dracula's origin. The cast includes several big-name, talented actors, such as Christopher Plummer, Jennifer Esposito, Omar Epps, and Sean Patrick Thomas. Each of these actors puts forth a good individual performance, but for some reason the film never seems to coalesce.

The major standout in the movie is most definitely Gerard Butler as Dracula. Butler is a phenomenal actor who seems to abandon himself to every role, and literally becomes the character that he portrays. Dracula is no exception, and his intense gaze, even in such a mediocre film, has the ability to make the viewer both shiver and swoon simultaneously with his dark power. This was early in his career though, and I suspect that if offered this part today, he would turn it down.

Dracula 2000 comes off feeling trashy, with a few cheap thrills and action scenes leading up to a relatively anti-climactic conclusion. In the end, I'm glad I saw it, although I would recommend it as a rental rather than a purchase.
