The product description says "If you already have a foundation in the principles of this exercise method, then this is the DVD to buy to further your ability."  Take that to heart.  I began pilates with six months of private lessons, and then decided to move on to my own mat work to save cash.  So I have the foundational skills.  That said, I am very inflexible.  And there are only a few select moves I can do past the Beginner stage of this DVD.

I am giving this DVD 3 stars because it is woefully inadequate in my opinion.

What it does well:
+ Includes progressively more difficult exercises that strictly follow Pilates classical techniques.

What it does not do well:
1.  Never explains which muscles you are engaging or why
2.  Never explains core breathing or movement (such as pelvis, shoulder, and other areas that are supposed to move in a certain way when breathing or executing exercises)
3.  Other than the Modified Basic, has no instruction or guidance for people who are not very flexible
4.  Has relatively few exercises for beginners.  There are many more things that you can do that are not shown on the video, which would be considered classical techniques.

For me, this all said, the DVD has some value.  I do use it.  But I use it in conjunction with other DVDs that I own.

My advice for others:
+ If you have never tried Pilates, skip this DVD... instead try Stott Pilates Standing Tall which spends 30 minutes explaining core movements in a very patient manner.
+ If you are a beginner or intermediate, and have no instructional videos for mat work, you can get this... but just know that the instruction is limited to the exercises you should do... and not how to do them correctly or why.
+ If you are advanced intermediate to advanced... honestly cannot provide guidance as I'm not familiar enought with your needs.
