Go in with modest expectations and you might be surprised. First off, the movie looks great. The aliens and their technology are enigmatic and godlike, and SPOILER you just know that humanity isn't going to last long (until the end when there is a twist that offers a bizarre kind of hope). The gals are nice looking, and even the "hero" who starts out as someone who is just hateable, maybe because he just looks like a freak, transforms into into someone (something) sympathetic by the time he comes out though the other side of the blender. Yes, there are some scientific errors (maybe that was a new type of nuke that you can watch explode through the window?), but come on, this is a movie that some guys made while working on other movies (and probably billing gazillions of dollars to those other movies while goofing off making this one); they must have been laughing like crazy much of the time, not least at how cool the FX were coming out, and how dismally the story unfolds for the hapless characters(look no further than their AVP2 for an almost identical tone). So don't pay much money to see this, but don't hate yourself if you're curious and do see it.
