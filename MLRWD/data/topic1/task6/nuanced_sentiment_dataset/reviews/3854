Well, it's a just a bunch of guys talking about women. They're all players, and they share their exploits--except for the married guy, who's a foil to the others. It's kind of a stuipd premise, and most of the scenes are pretty obvious and not funny.
Predictably, they all end-up involved with the same girl (Mia, played by the super-cute Amanda Peet). The execution of that twist is well-done and works to inject interesting irony under the humor. But that's really the only thing going in the whole plot. The conflict development happens a little bit late in the movie, which makes it something of a slow start. (Just a little. I mean, it's not as a bad as "Snow Falling on Cedars".)
The to-the-camera narratives are done out-of-context of the movie, which makes them plausible and less awkward than in most other movies that try this silly technique. And since they're less awkward, they come off as a little bit more insightful.
The plot resolution is a little ambiguous, and kind of sudden. But the movie examines the aftermath very deeply, and that's where it makes its point; that's where the real curve ball comes out.
