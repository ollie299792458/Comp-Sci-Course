I bought this DVD in April to watch with my parents when I came to visit on break from college. We're all Andrew Lloyd Webber fans but had never seen this concert before, so I knew we'd enjoy it.

I was prepared to love the DVD; I was not prepared to spend $300 in the 2.5 months following the purchase of the DVD buying up all the Michael Ball items I could get my hands on--including joining his fan club.

He steals the show, and you absolutely fall in love with him from his first song. Words cannot describe...so I will not even try.

As for the other performances, Elaine Paige was amazing, of course. Antonio's Evita performances were very enjoyable but found him lacking in Phantom. Tina Arena gives a powerful performance, and Donny and Glenn were better than I expected.

Outside of Memory and Ball's performances, my favorite has to be "No Matter What" by Boyzone. They give boy bands a good name.

This DVD will be watched and re-watched and become a household favorite but be prepared to become hopelessly devoted to Michael Ball.
