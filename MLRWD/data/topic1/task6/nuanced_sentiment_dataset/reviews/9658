Okay, the clown-abuse scene:  Definitely the harshest portrayal of rape I've ever come across (even trumping Blue Velvet).  These villains are far more disturbing than Frank Booth or the rednecks in Deliverance.
That aside, not a great movie, but not as horrible as some would have you believe.  The acting is a bit wooden, but the story is fairly interesting and will hold your attention (as opposed to falling asleep on the couch, as I am prone to do!).  One major flaw was the mis-casting of "silent bob" as Flappy's agent/publicist.  He doesn't look right in the role, and his acting is pretty bad here.
Vulgar has elements that will remind you of Gummo and/or Julien Donkey-Boy.  If you like disturbing films by young up-and-coming, envelope-pushing filmmakers, this will probably be right up your alley.  However, you will probably be hard-pressed to think of anyone you can recommend or lend this to!
One thing that can be said, even by those who hate it, is that it is not boring (the worst crime any film can commit).
