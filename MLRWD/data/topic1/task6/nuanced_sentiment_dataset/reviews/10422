A likable comedy with some famous comedians, it is an unlikable event in reality. This is a story which came out a prank by two brothers. Barry (Jonathan Silvers) places an Internet ad for his brother Todd (Jonathan Bray) on a gay website. When Todd goes to meet his date at a gay coffee shop he had no idea it was a man, Kelly (Wilson Cruz.) They both have a lot of things in common and a friendship develops. But everybody in Todd's world, including his co-workers, starts believing that he is gay. His mother (Sally Kirkland) arrives into town to see the news and tries to be the newly understanding mother of a gay son.

Kelly and Todd finally have sex as an experiment but proves what Todd has been saying all along, he is not gay. The movie ends with a reversal where Barry claims that he is gay (his mother thinks that he is doing it to get attention.) Todd and Kelly remain friends and even discuss about having a family.

This movie is in the same style of Eating Out, with a similar dumb scheme. Even though Coffee Date is a pleasant comedy, the idea of gay men even considering to convert straight guys is preposterous. It is not in the genes and it will never happen. And this idea has been portrayed in many movies, DUMB!!!  The movie does have one redeeming quality, true friendship goes beyond all barriers. It gets a plus for that.
