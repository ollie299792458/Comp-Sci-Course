I really enjoyed the first movie, but this one had terrible writing.  Its so bad that they made a major goof at the end....he announces that it is 1 hr from sunrise, so they need to get on the prop plane and get from the Smithsonian in DC to New York city.  Trouble is, it would take 90-120 min by that kind of plane.  After arriving, they mention that Emilia has to get back to the Smithsonian prior to sunrise (another 90 min return).  There are times it seems they were looking for fillers to fill the time, it doesn't seem to be a smooth story.  One of the worst parts is when he meets the security guard at the Smithsonian - 5 minutes of utter boredom with a few dumb jokes put in.  I was yelling "boring."

My other beef is the political correctness of this movie, but thats pretty common with Hollywood.  The people brought back new in this movie: Of the good guys/gals/, the female (Emilia) and minority (Tuskegee flyers) are all seen very positive, but the 2 whites - Abraham Lincoln and Gen George Custer are both negative.  Abraham Lincoln was made to look like a babbling idiot. The portrayal of Gen Custer was not only inaccurate but insulting. As another commentator on here wrote "This fool was not the George Custer who won the Metal of Honor at First Manassas, nor the George Custer who defeated Jeb Stewart at Hannibal in the Battle of Gettysburg."  Two of the three bad guys were Napoleon and Ivan the terrible, and again made to look stupid.  Can you imagine if they had made Emilia or the Tuskegee folks come back like that?  Of course not.

On the only positive side, the CGI/graphics (I rented the Bluray version) are very good and the animals seem real, as well as having the paintings come to life (one wonders if they stole this from Harry Potter

This is a movie to rent, but i am not spending money to add to a collection.  Little kids who dont need a plot might enjoy it....
