Except that it's not really a blob, but an amorphous mass of tentacles and some sort of intestines, or maybe they were one of the same.  It matters little, since this is no slow-moving Blob, but an intelligent and highly aggressive bio-creature, with the twist of man's arrogance and stupidity thrown into the mix.
I was most impressed with how many "main" characters died, and quickly, like the sheriff.  That is so much more realistic than a group that escapes death while 100s fall like dead leaves everywhere else.
Shawnee Smith was great, beautiful and strong, a true heroine.  I was turned off at first by Kevin Dillon here, but he did OK for what was still a replay of his brother's roles, the rebel tough guy in jeans and trouble with the cops.  The obnoxious bald deputy getting snapped in half as he was pulled through a door was a sick but satisfying effect, he was a pig jerk.
The ending, like the original, was left wide open for a sequel, but nothing has yet been made.  Too bad, they could improve it one more time, esp. in this age of reboot before the first film is out on DVD.
Overall, an enjoyable film, and enough evil bad humans died to make it worthwhile.
