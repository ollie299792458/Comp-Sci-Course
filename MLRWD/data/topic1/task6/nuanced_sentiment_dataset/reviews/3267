I am glad that I finally got to see this. My family didn't have cable when this originally aired.

I would like to point out a couple of insignificant things. Willis Bell is horrible in this. He looks like he is just walking through his part. In addition, He looks like he is forty years old.

The series continues the practice of introducing characters from the oneL class, doing a story on them, and then we never see them again: Like the young Mother that can't get childcare or Lynn Swann's character.

I love seeing the magnificent John Houseman as Kingsfield. The only thing is that he has mellowed out abit in his eighties. In the 1973 movie Kingsfield would have bitten your dog: roasted kittens on Christmas morning. In the second season female students are coming to him to ask advice on love. Maybe they should have had a female Law Professor to balance out his character.

Three cheers to Michael Tucci as the uptight President of the Law review. I particularly like the episodes where the Wonks disable his car and the one where he gets laid.

Still one of the great shows of all time. I will be sad when season 3 comes out because it will never be new to me again. Long live the young lawyers.
