This is not your typical RomCom.  The male lead has ASD and so this story is more interesting than the average.  I enjoyed the way the story played out and found the subject matter to be more thought provoking than the typical, canned RomCom formula movie.

One thing that interested me was the portrayal of this man as a high functioning autistic individual.  When I was young it was thought that everyone with autism was so severely handicapped that an institution was the only option.  These days the definition of autism has broadened to include people from all walks of life, many of whom have escaped the "label" completely, while still struggling with the issues inherent to autism spectrum.

I might have given it four or five stars, but the ending left me feeling a bit dissatisfied.  Perhaps this is where the movie's one significant flaw lies - it is an identity crisis where the script cannot decide whether this is a romance or whether it is a "coming of age" story with a social message.  I think that it could have been both and not suffered any loss of impact, but the ending left unanswered questions that bugged me enough to give it only 3 stars.
