Joshua Bell is one of my least favorite violinists.  He plays well enough, certainly.  But his "music making" is so self-important and superficial that I can not listen to him at all anymore.  His stage presence is no better.  A retired concertmaster I used to know, whose major-league orchestra has accompanied Mr. Bell a dozen or more times in the past 30 years, often called his playing "pretty but stupid."  As for this DVD...well, he plays the Tchaikovsky.  A friend lent it to me and insisted I watch it, so I did.  Now in his mid forties, Bell's playing has not deepened with age.  He sounds the same way now as he did when I first heard him in his late teens and early 20s.  Really too bad.  I think he's been so overexposed and commercialized from day one that the world can't help but love him (and I speak also of his People Magazine "World's 50 Most Beautiful Men" status in the early 90s.) I wonder if he even practices anymore or tries to go further...if so, I haven't heard it come out of his fiddle.  Oh well, at least his agents are doing what he's paying them to do...but his time has quite clearly passed.  Move over, Joshua, you had your turn in the sunbeam and there are others who need to occupy your place!!

The rest of the concert, Beethoven and Sibelius - both are fine.  Nothing further to add.

Needless to say, if you want to buy a better classical concert DVD, there are so many other better ones on Amazon to choose from.  'Put this one back on the shelf' and keep looking.
