This is classic 80s horror. 5 teen boys accidently set fire to a camp host, he escapes with his life. 5 years later he comes back for revenge. Now at camp, a secondary story starts about teens hooking up. You have the classic jock, the joker, the nerd and the weird kid that everyone picks on. The music is set just right for on the edge of your seat experiences. The quick stops and flashes of images literally make you scream outloud. The suspense will drive you mad, as you have to imagine what the killer looks like, as you can only see through his eyes. Simple cat and mouse techniques throughout as you wait for a glimse of the monster. You do get to see him in the end. Effects pretty good for this movie. Lots of blood in the end. Grab your friends and a bucket of popcorn, see this one in the dark.
