I saw this video on a clip from collagevideo.com (that's a good way to pre-view the dvd before you buy it). It looked like it would be a good 'workout video', not instruction. It also shows that Kathy is really just learning herself. If you have experience with bellydance just do the moves correctly and you'll get a good workout. If you have no clue about bellydance and you want a workout video get 'Basic moves' by Neena and Veena.The camera does move to Ansuya alot so you can see the fluid, graceful moves (what it should look like), and Ansuya's costumes are beautiful. It is a great workout and fun! So if you know basic moves already get the video and do it correctly, that simple, and you'll get a great aerobic workout. If you don't know bellydance learn the moves from class or the video I recommended. A fantastic site for great and real bellydance performance and instruction is VisionaryDance.com, there is also an absolute beginner dvd. Delilah is one of the greatest bellydancers I have ever seen perform.
