As both a fan of the book and the movies I was very disappointed by the film. It did not do the book justice. Though OoTP was a long book more of the lighter, funnier and better story lines could of been included in the film without making it run too long. Many details were changed such as Sirus calling Harry James, Cho was the one who ratted out DA, Luna and Harry meeting in the woods to discuss Thestrals, Harry drawing his wand in front of Dudley's friends and so on. Professor Trewlany who is a delight has minimal screen time which was disappointing . But what was more disappointing was the fact Sirius was barely in the film and that Luna had barely any screen time. Besides the Weasly twins Luna made the book more interesting. By cutting down the Luna story line this made the film very tense. Im am non plussed at this point. I thought the first 2 films stayed very true to the book and had that pardon the pun the magic that makes a movie great. I loved the fact the third and forth films were darker but certain details were changed or omitted much like this the fifth film. The acting from Radcliffe was different as if he no longer had to try and the acting flowed from him which made him more natural in this film. I was a little disappointed in the casting of Luna Lovegood but then the actress had such little screen time the made her seem meek. I was also disappointed because we did not see as much of the trio as in the previous films. Hermoine and Ron are important to the plot and they had been in more scenes the film would of been better. I have never really cared for the new Dumbledore this actor makes Dumbledore seem tense,uncaring and harsh at times. It was a good film but if you loved the book as much as I did don't expect to love this movie as much as the book.
