Just like thousands upon thousands of people have said this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This movie has set the standard for martial arts fantasy and fighting movies in general. Crouching Tiger introduces us to a great cast of characters with only one of them being an international star to start with. The plot is fairly complex and the movie altogether presents a huge setting than spans from forests to deserts and mountains. The only thing that I have already witnessed and continually worry about is fight scenes in movies being performed with wires. It was amazing and inovative to see it in Crouching Tiger but now it seems that every movie that contains fight scenes has to make use of wire contraptions to aid them. Will there come a time when no movies will be without the use of wire aperature fighting.....? I guess I can always count on Jackie Chan for his pure style of fighting and stunts.
I was disapointed when watching this that people in the audience laughed when the characters flew.  They were all shouting and laughing saying it was really fake.  But who laughed when Superman flew????  I bet you nobody.  They were in awe as they should have been while watching Crouching Tiger.  This is not reality, it is a fantasy world in which anything is possible.
