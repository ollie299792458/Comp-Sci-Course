We really enjoyed this DVD and all the worksheets and information included on the 2nd CD.  We won't be following their program exactly, but will use many of the ideas included.  It did inspire us to go ahead and add rabbits to our farm, and helped us to decided that we don't want to raise cattle for food, or milk.  We have decided that dairy goats are a better investment for us and are getting rid of our cows.  The information on water was terrific and I am busy trying to find the trees and vines she mentioned.  It also inspired my husband to take a course in tanning hides.  I can't wait for my seeds to arrive and see what kind of fruit and greens we get off them for us and our animals.
I did think the tanning information was VERY light, and would have liked a little more about how to stop a dog from killing chickens, as we have that problem currently.

All in all I thought it was very informative and I learned a lot, even if all that was on there was the part about the trees, it would have been worth the money to me.  My husband has already used the information about skinning a rabbit and found it worked exactly the way she showed in the DVD.  He watched that part and went straight out and did it, perfect.
If you are interested in starting a farm or just want to raise trees that are healthy and good for you too, it is a good buy.  The water conservation is great, too.  Made us go out and buy a water storage tank and we are putting in a pond for our animals.
We loved this and plan to watch it over and over.
