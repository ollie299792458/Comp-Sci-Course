Dr. Alec Holland along with the newly recruited Dr. Cable (Adrienne Barbeau) are working on an experiment to create a human/plant hybrid species when the evil Arcane crashes their lab in pursuit of the formula. In the ensuing hysteria, Holland is transformed into the titular Swamp Thing and Cable is left to protect their discovery as she is pursued by Arcane and his henchmen. Naturally, it's up to Swamp Thing to save the day.

"Swamp Thing". The title alone seems to be rich with possibilities for a good sci-fi/action/comic flick packed to the hilt with slimy special effects, fast paced action, and colorful characters. Sadly, this is not exactly the case and this film feels like a major missed opportunity. In reality, Wes Craven's 1982 adaptation of DC Comics' Swamp Thing is a rather dry and often times tedious watch that leaves you longing for what could have been.

However it's not all bad. You do get a bath scene with Barbeau, nice scenic footage of the swamp, and there are some good mutation scenes done with old school special effects. On the whole, a watchable time waster. This would make for a nice double feature with Jim Wynorski's superior 1989 sequel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007L4NB">The Return of Swamp Thing</a> for B-movie fanatics. **/****
