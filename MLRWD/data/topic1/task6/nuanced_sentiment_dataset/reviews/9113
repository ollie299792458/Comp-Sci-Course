I saw this wretched dvd at a friends house.  I couldnt decide whether or not this was supposed to be funny or taken seriously.

Regardless, John Russo and friends totally ruined George Romeros groundbreaking horror classic.  The soundtrack is ridiculous, it sounds as though the composer bought a $30 Casio keyboard and wrote some cheesy gothic horror songs for the soundtrack. And who do they think they are fooling with Bill Heinzman reprising his role as the original zombie 30 years later? Did they think no one would notice he looked like he was close to 40 in the original, and in the new footage he looks like hes 70 at the youngest?Please.  Also i noticed another thing about the family who died at Beekmans Diner in the car crash:Check out one of the kids shoes, as they are actually Sketchers I believe. I'm no expert on the shoe business so correct me if I'm wrong, but I dont think the Sketchers shoe company was around in 1968.  Did anyone see the "music video" for the ridiculous "Dance of the Dead".  Thats probably the most entertaining feature about the dvd.  I found the music video to be corny and terrible, but utterly hiliarious.  Anyways, don't waste your money on this garbage.  The new music score is way below subpar as is the acting and scripting for the additional material.  The original Romero feature was a low budget masterpiece.  This, however is just a half-assed attempt at filmmaking and yet another way for no talent filmakers to cash in on a classic.  Avoid.
