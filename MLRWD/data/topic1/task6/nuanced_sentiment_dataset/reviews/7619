Hmmm well, being a fan of the games, the genre, and this series, I will say I was satisfied but somewhat disappointed as well. Unlike the first one, where while attempting to follow the video game series, they added in a story line that fit in the elements of the game, this one added in elements of Resident Evil 5 (the video game) with no explanation as to how they fit in the storyline. The zombies with tenticales coming out of their mouths and the dogs whose heads split in half are based on a different virius whose orgins were not explored in this movie. The movie also adds in the characters Jill Valentine (not sure if this was the same actress from the second movie) and Chris Redfield with no backstory as to their involvment.Another item that someone who gave a worse rating pointed out, Wesker injected Alice with a serum that removed the virus that gave her the superhuman strength and agility, yet she doesn't seem rid of these elements at all during the movie.

But overall those were the only real problems I had with the film. I did like it better than 2 and 3 which were too over the top with superhuman alice, especially #2. Although I did enjoy Mike Epps' light humor to the movie which was destroyed buy the over-the-top antics (can you tell how much I hated the wire-fu that was used). #3 was hardly memorable which is why I won't make any comparisons. While this was not as good as #1, I was generaly entertained by the setting (prison) and most of the story so much so that I didn't realize how little it focused on the zombies or had them on screen. Probably a similar budget cutting technique as the one used in #2 (remember the out of focus shots of zombies).

So in summary, not a bad movie with a decent run time.  Worth the money and looks great in Blu-ray. You can keep that 3D stuff, I already wear glasses to watch TV.
