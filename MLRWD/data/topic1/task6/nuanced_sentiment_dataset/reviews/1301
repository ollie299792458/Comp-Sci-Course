I got this movie because I'm just soo in love with B2k. They dance really good. I mean, they're doing backflips and everything and I'm telling you your jaw will drop at all the moves they did. It was surreal! However, I believe that the dancing made up for their acting. I guess it's good considering this is their first "major" movie. But it needs work. One part of the movie that made it cheezy (that means phoney) was the fact that they were carriers for this boy named Emerald who's supposedly a drug dealer. I don't get it why don't they just go and get real jobs! I don't really go for ghetto movies, unless it's a comedy. I guess that's what made it look cheezy.
There WERE other parts of the movie that made it better though, and even surprise me a little. Like the fact that they all looked like normal people in this movie. I know it sounds cheezy, but when you're a fanatic like me, you just expect that they would be an exception. They weren't. If they had never come out as B2k and passed me in the street, I would've just looked and kept going. That's how "normal" they looked. That's one thing I liked, though.  They didn't try to make superstars act like normal people while they still looked like they came outta Hollywood. That got them a few points with me. 
Another thing that surprised me was that I knew Omarion would be kissing that girl Jessica Freeman, but I didn't know he would be doing it twice! They looked like they might put some tongue in it--but didn't. Dang!
Another thing I didn't realize is that they showed J-Boog in a brother-like, almost fatherly, light--especially to the little boy called Lil' Saint. I figured as fine as he is they would show him as a player. It made him look sexier!
Well, that's all I got to say-- Glad I got THAT all out!!
