If you're a boy age 12 or below - AND ONLY THEN - you might enjoy this movie. For the rest of us (people over 12 with at least half a brian & up) - it's probably one of the worst blockbusters you will ever see. In your life! I'm not asking much from a movie like this - really - BUT the plot, and all characters - human & alien alike - are SO shallow & empty - that you can't help feeling personally insulted watching this trash. I'm someone that enjoyed the new Terminator, Batman & Star Trek - these franchises have evolved, while not sacrificing their Sci-Fi & Comic book roots. They gained depth & respect from audiences of all ages by becoming more - Transformers however, has gone the other direction - by becoming WAY WAY less. Idiotic jive talking robots ala annoying Jar Jar Binks infamy, hysterical overacting, and a feel that reminds you of that awful '97 'Batman & Robin' with Mr. Freeze - only worse - numbs your senses for 2 1/2 hours. All the over the top settings & special effects can't bring this movie up to a 2 star rating. And Megan Fox' character is about 3 times too hot for Shia LaBeouf, on a side note. But I don't mind either actors - I actually think they can act way better, than what they're forced to lower themselves to by director Michael Bay - someone who's 'movies' I will NOT touch again with a ten foot pole as long as I can help it. Such trash is simply offensive - it's the lowest of all possible denominators a movie can sink to. GO AWAY - MICHAEL BAY!!!
