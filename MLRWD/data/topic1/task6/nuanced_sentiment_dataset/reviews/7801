I admit it... I was overly curious and purchased this film for $20 before having seen it. Do I regret this? Halfway... Although, I'm kind of glad I bought it.

First of all, I'm a huge fan of ALL of the leads and I thought they all did awesome jobs. Secondly, some of the scenes in this movie are SIDE-SPLITTING hilarious. As far as parody flicks go, this is one of the champions. What's not to love?

Well... There is quite a bit not to love I'm afraid. First of all, this movie is a bit unbalanced. The first half is hilarious but the second half gets a little choked in the girth of it's own plot. Also, the film has a couple EXTREMELY crude scenes. (For example, the scene where they tie Jack Black to a tree has some of the most offensive dialogue I've ever heard in a film... Sheesh.) Besides a couple of scenes, the vulgarity is pretty usual (what you'd expect from a movie like this) so... there you go.

I'm not going to sit here and say that I went into this film expecting "Night at The Museum" and was shocked and horrified by it... It's rated R and rightfully so. For the most part, this is a fun and entertaining film with lots of great laughs and some wonderful performances. Sadly the other 25% of the film relies on shock value humor and sheer number of profanities.
