Beautiful movie. Tragic truth in some instances.  I am a fourth year teacher in Louisiana.  Unfortunately, I am not tenured yet.  And yet the "tenure track" in Louisiana does not carry the same weight as in other states.  We do not have collective bargaining protects tenured teachers who have become incompetent or incapable.  (Thank God)
Disturbing to watch how several families are impacted by the new charter schools which have a better success rate and only one student makes it and another student makes it only after circumstances arise which prevents another student from accepting the terms of the selection (or whatever...).
What about the teachers?  What about the lack of parental support?  At this juncture, I feel that the title could apply be used to describe how not only parents feel, but teachers feel as well?
Overall, I think that the discussion is necessary to engage creative and inventive ways of promoting education in America. We cannot continue to do things the same way and only have a marginal degree of success.  The fact that we are way more interested in building prisons and not schools is ridiculously.  What can be done to change that if at all possible?  Whose child has to be arrested before anything is done in a positive way to address this matter?  Just food for thought.  This movie does wet our appetites for social justice, but it left me dissatisfied.

Mad props for Geoffrey Canada and the Harlem School Project.
