I had read how this was built up as one of the best six minute swordfights on film, so I thought it would be interesting.  In my husband's words, "these guys couldn't TOUCH Basil Rathbone and Danny Kaye."  Watch the "Court Jester" if you want that. Then, let's get to the story.  Hero is a classic smarmy rake who likes to shovel the flowery composte as the women swoon.  Elenor Parker's character was great, and the fact that the rake uses her unrepentantly before he decides to marry the perfect little virgin (Janet Leigh) in the end made me want to barf.  Especially unbelievable was this woman scorned gleefully waving to the married couple in the end as if to say, 'ah, go, be happy for I am not good enough for him."  In what universe would that happen?  More than likely little Janet would have found some deadly night shade in her wine as the acting troupes wagons slipped out of town.  Still it is classic MGM swashbuckling, great costumed film with some witty dialogue.  Thus the two stars.
