This review is based on having the series when it first came out here in the US.  It is an excellent concept that deserved better than it got.  Contrary to some who think the director was being inovating at the end just didn't pay attention to the fact that while the animation was spectacular in Eps-1&2, the budgets were being squeezed once the Company realized they had over-extended themselves with their first big project.  The fact is that the last episode actually had to use art off the story-board in order to finish the story.  Unfortunately, it was clear from the second tape (eps.3 & 4) that the quality of the animation was slipping quite visably from the opening episodes and the last tape showed just how close they came to not finishing the story at all, in fact the time between the second and last tape was double the original gap from #1 and the second.  We, at the time of the original release, thought they bailed on this one and still hold that opinion.

That is not to say this is a bad story, on the contrary it is a great story.  Sure it starts out light with young girls in tight suits and a sense of fun and adventure, it soon makes clear that it is a story of genocidel war, sense of duty, and the harsh cost that war can extract on those who have to fight it.  More than just another mecha story, this is a story of the cost payed by people who wished for a normal life but were destined to sacrifice all but true friendship in pursuit of doing what has to be done.  It is the story, and it's faithfulness to costs of light-speed travel, that makes this great-whil eps.1&2 show how great animation can be when supported properly.  Unfortunately, the rest of the series showes what happens when the bean-counters (accountants) are let to wonder away from their ledgers and allowed to make operating decisions.
