"Normal" people will not like this movie.  If they like "normal" movies with linear plots, good guys, bad guys rising action, falling action, resolution i don't know if you're going to get that here.
I'm not a "Normal" person and I love it.
When the movie ended, I had this non-stop laugh that lasted about 2 minutes.  It was uncontrollable.
This movie is an "omni-genre" film.  A drama, comedy, musical, love story, murder mystery, kidnapping, amnesia, sci-fi and others.

I love movies that have an all-star cast - every person in the movie is famous.  I love movies with famous people where they are doing things that are the opposite of their public persona. (The Rock, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Mandy Moore, Justin Timberlake, Jon Lovitz, Stifler, Kevin Smith, Booger from Revenge of the Nerds, the girl from Upright Citizens Brigade and many others etc.)  It's like John Goodman's character in The Big Lebowski.

There is references to alternative energy in the film.

This movie has everything thrown into it.  And its just that - it's all thrown into it.  No order, totally freestyled movie.  If you want to see something different, this is it.

I mean cmon people .... aren't you tired of the same old movie all the time?  If you want a movie going experience where you have absolutely no idea what you are going to see next, this is the movie.

This is the perfect balance of being different without being completely "what the heck did I just watch" like you might have felt after seeing "THE FOUNTAIN" by Aronofsky.  I thought that movie sucked but I did like PI, and I could see how others liked Requiem.

So don't worry, this isn't THE FOUNTAIN, its more on The Big Lebowski or Pulp Fiction tip but the dialogue isn't as good.

But i enjoyed it and all of my "non-normal" friends did.

And if you have seen this movie and you're reading this review remember this: "I'm a pimp, and pimps don't commit suicide."

We look for new movie going experiences, and this provided it.
