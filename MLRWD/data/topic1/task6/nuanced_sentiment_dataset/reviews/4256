Art is, of course, in the eye of the beholder. If, however, you're seriously considering this movie, PLEASE pay close attention to the majority of viewers (21/38 at the time of this writing, not including mine) who very generously gave it one star - if they feel like me, they only gave it the one star because Amazon doesn't allow zero or sub-zero ratings.  I saw a review in the Washington Post that summed it up perfectly for me - one can only hope to "mentally scrape it off the bottom of one's shoe,"  and forget it as quickly as possible (and how I wish I'd seen that review before I spent the price of one adult and 2 kid's tickets to the theater).  If, like a bug to a zapper light, you're drawn to this BECAUSE of all the bad reviews, RENT it first, and share the cost with as many people as possible to minimize the financial pain once you've seen it.  Honestly, it has to be the worst movie I've ever seen - and my two kids, ages 5 & 12 at the time, totally agreed.  No plot, poor animation, rambling.  Bottom line, "try before you buy!" - it'll be cheaper.
