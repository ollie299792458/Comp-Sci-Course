Of all the great work that Spike Jonze and George Kaufman have done (together or separate), this is my favorite. I don't like to give too much away, because I feel that there are some revelatory moments in the film that might be rendered less powerful if you're too aware of the how's and why's of this movie, but there are things that can be said in its favor that don't require going to far into the actual plot.

First of all, it's extremely innovative in its use of film narrative. I think you really have to see it unfold to get it. It starts of fairly traditionally, depicting events based on fact: Kaufman was approached to do a movie adaptation of the book The Orchid Thief, and then proceeds to work on it.

Secondly, when this film came out, there was a fair amount of mystery surrounding it: is the twin brother credited with collaborating on the screen play real? How much of the film is factual, where does the line between reality and adaptation occur?

Finally, I've read a lot of mixed reviews of the ending. A lot of people seem to think it was too hokey, too unbelievable or even too Hollywood. I argue that it was a perfect way to end a film, one of whose many accomplishments is to point out the absurdity of adapting best-sellers into films as a way of further capitalizing on the success of the book itself.

If I say any more I fear I'll give away too much. I hope this review intrigues you enough to rent the DVD, and that in turn the film intrigues you enough to go online and investigate further the story behind it.
