I love Lucy Liu.  I like Antonio Banderas.  I love action movies.  I hate movies that have completely unrealistic explosions and obviously coreographed stunts/car crashes.  This movie was full of both - cars that are blown by McVeigh size explosions straight up in the air, simply by being shot at; two cars that simultaneously barrel roll after running into a wrecked truck; people unhurt by being engulfed in flaming explosions; etc.
Add to this general [poo-iness], a dismal story.  It was awful, predictable, cookie cutter, plain, unimaginative, sophmoric, [dumb], [word], and pukey.  Even the premise of the movie, a microscopic, injectible, and remote controlled death micro-machine (which is a pretty cool element) was not fleshed out at all.  Here you go folks, a death machine.  Plot element.  We stole it, and put it under the skin of the main villains child to smuggle it out of the country.  No explanation of how it was stolen, why it was stolen, how it was built, who built it, why it was built, how it works, who wants it, how to inject it, how to get it out -- nothing. Period.  Anyways, this thing unexplainably will kill whoever it is injected into within a certain time, or it can kill that person by remote control.  Hey, I see I'm rambling....sorry.
I just want to reiterate, if you love Lucy Liu, go rent "Payback," she's great in that, and save yourself the eight bucks for this stinker.
