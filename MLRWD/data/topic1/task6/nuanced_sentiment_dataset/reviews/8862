While not as good as Demon Knight, Bordello of Blood is more than the porn it seems by first glance. The movie just misses some things that the first film had. One thing being that the cast in this film is a lot weaker than what was in the original. Can you imagine Dennis Miller as the hero? It's a little too farfetched to believe. Not saying that he is bad in the film, but he just wasn't that great. But he did bring his famous sarcasm to this movie. I did, however, like Christopher Sarandon as the preacher.

The special effects in this movie didn't seem to be used as much as they were in the original film, but what is there, it is still pretty good. The movie just isn't that funny and the movie is definitely not scary. It tries to make jokes that just aren't that good and Corey Feldman does not make a good vampire. Even with all of that said, still, the movie isn't boring. It does have enough to keep interest, the final scenes of the film when Dennis and Chris use squirt guns full of holy water is something to see.  The special effects during that sequence were well done.

Overall, this movie is just average. Sorry that I keep comparing to the original film even though this has nothing to do with the original except for the name and the return of the key they were trying so hard to protect in the first movie. But "Demon Knight" set a bar that this one didn't really meet. The movie is fun, and the funniest thing in this film is the man in the bar that keeps sending people to the bordello. Not the greatest of the Tales from the Crypt movies, but the worst "Crypt" movie is better than most films that are put out in the genre. Worth watching, maybe not worth buying unless you are a "Tales" fan.
