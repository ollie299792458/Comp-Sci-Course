...kids who drown in chocolate, turn into blueberries, get trapped in the  tv set? strange dwarves with poofy hair who pop out to sing about  morals?...
as odd as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory still seems  after nearly 30 years, it remains a rare breed of classic: one that seems  comfortable simultaneously appealing to children and their parents with  'lesson-a-day morality' while appealing to the ages by simultaneously  lampooning the means (threatening, brainwashing, etc.) society employs to  teach morals... all in all, the movie isn't directed much at kids -- just  check out the psychodelic boat scene which references hell itself -- as  much as at their adult 'teachers'... in the end, everyone is incompetent  and true morality, if corrupt, at least deserves a lifetime supply of  chocolate (a vice in itself)... indeed, Willy Wonka, who seems quite at  ease in his role as heavy-handed teacher, utterly content to march his  failed pupils off to the furnaces, is himself flawed to the point of  madness... a sobering film deep down, but on the surface drop-dead funny!  enjoy this... just don't think too much!
