My initial reaction was that there were simply too many twists in the plot for this film's own good. It was hard keep up, and in the end you just gave up trying. However, a second viewing with the director's commentary switched on revealed an actually very intelligent and well-acted film. While this extra input should not really have been necessary, it was worth it for this film. If you pay very close attention and/or are have seen lots of examples of the spy/crime genre and are therefore used to the perhaps inevitably twisted storylines, you may even get it in one! However, even if you do, Frankenheimer's wonderfully intelligent explanation of his work is very highly recommended, and a major treat in itself. (Where would we have been in the days before the DVD special features section?!) So, while a little unbelievable at times, the film itself is generally quite a treat too, with some genuinely great performances (especially De Niro's), highly filmic Parisian and Riviera locations and neat camerawork - not least in relation to the truly outstanding car-chase sequences. The latter really are absolutely breathtaking, and the result of huge effort and dedication by all those involved in their production.
