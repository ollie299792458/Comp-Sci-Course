Well, first and most obvious is the poor dubbing of this movie.  It's a french film with english voiced over.  But... only some parts were voiced, and the rest (almost half) remains in french.  There weren't even subtitles.  I found this distracting me from the plot, since I didn't know what they were communicating.

Many people complain about the plot twist at the end, but I don't think it really damages the story.  The plot twist makes sense given the context (a story is being told).  The story is almost like a psychological mystery for the audience once the plot twist takes place.  I liked it.

Aside from the plot twist, the rest of the story was a decent slasher film - filled with exciting visuals, cool effects, and scary situations.  The characters behaviors were rather ridiculous though.  In context of the plot twist it seems reasonable, BUT this is no excuse to give the audience unrealistic action.  This being the core of the film, I wasn't thrilled.

Bad dubbing, poor realism, but decent slasher material, and a cool twist.  Very much worth a rent.
