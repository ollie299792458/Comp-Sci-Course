Anyone who thinks that taking one of the many aspects of war as a guide could possibly tell the whole story is a fool. Anyone who comes to any negative conclusions based upon this movie (which I fear is the case since many in our PC culture watch this crap) is a fool!!

Anyone who believes this is the way it happened is so shaded from reality that they  should get down on their knees and praise the Good Lord that brave people are able to take care of the problems they refuse to honestly deal with.

Anyone who isn't troubled by this movie is insane, but anyone who believes that this movie tells anything about Vietnam needs to get a grip. To believe this movie gives any piece to the puzzle in the whole story of Vietnam War or even a small glimmer into the story of a group of soldiers (much less the valor of other soldiers) is so sadly ignorant of reality - they must reside in a comfortable place protected by such soldiers or in the misguided realm of liberal Utopian BS. This movie is CRAP!!

This movie is Hollywood want-a-be great, but ends up insulting people who cared about our country. This is BS!
This movie does not depict what happened. If you are entertained by crap and lies like this to further your silly ideas, then this movie is for you.
