Before I bought this movie I've read the reviews here on Amazon.com, and one review said something about the child being molested by the director during the making of this movie. I still bought it because of many good reviews, but I also surfed on the net to find out more about the story behind the movie, and I found the answers. The director did molest the young 12 year old lead in this movie during the making of it, AND he taped it. This evidence convicted him (for only 3 years!(?)).
Anyway knowing that the director is a child-molester makes you spot things in the movie. The young lead filmed changing his underwear showing his nude rear end, his 15 y/o (movie)brother filmed in tight underwear, and his 17 y/o (movie)brother saying strange lines to his younger (movie)brothers like: "don't feel each other up when I'm gone" and "let's see if you got any hair on places where it counts" such things made me wonder if I was watching a good horror-movie or a child-porn-flick. Besides those scenes which made me wonder, it was a relativle good movie with a good story, and quite good SFX.
