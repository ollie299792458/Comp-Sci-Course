I saw this movie for the second time last night and I was struck by a curious symmetry that totally escaped me the first time. While the core of the movie revolves around the simplistic Taoist rules for getting women employed by the hero, Dex, and their apparent destruction at the hands of "true love" with heroine Syd, there is a curious twist that actually reinforces the Tao of Steve.
MAJOR SPOILER FOLLOWS.......
Consider the actions of Syd. She:
1) loses her desire for Dex. (10 years of loathing after their one night stand took their toll.)
2) shows her excellence in his precense (playing the drums, remember?)
and, then after an hour of screen time full of assorted machinations, she:
3) splits for New York!
So the _real_ message is that the Tao of Steve can not only work for overweight men, but for women as well.
In my view these characters had a long way to go before really falling in love and, in many respects, the movie ends just as the real story about that potential love is about to begin.
