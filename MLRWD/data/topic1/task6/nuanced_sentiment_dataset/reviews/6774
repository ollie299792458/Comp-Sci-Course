After watching Bad Boys countless times on TV, I began to get, to say the least, a little bored with it, even though I loved the movie for it's humor and action sequences. Not the most serious sequences I've seen before, but packed with attitude and adrenaline.
It was good news to me when I found that Bad Boys II had been released on DVD, I didn't feel compelled to spend my 10 dollars to go see it at the Cinema, but now I wish I had've. Although I didn't leap on the DVD as soon as it was released I eventually got around to watching it, much to my liking, after viewing it.
Even though this movie may have had some bland jokes and some poor attempts at humor, I found the story line enticing, more so than the Bad Boys, the original. It is a simple plot yes, but it is, I think, a realistic depiction of the underground, if not exagerrated slighty with Will and Martin's crass behaviour and outrageous attitude.
The action scenes are brilliant and the car chase some half an hour into the movie is excellent and original. "Bullet time" (Matrix invention) is improvised in periods during the movie, emphasising on critical moments and/or gory deaths which seem to be dominant in this sequel, as compared to Bad Boys.
I think the movie deserves a good review, although the bad points include an overdone attempt at humor and sometimes during the movie, the attitude gimmick becomes a little tiresome.
As I read in another review, I don't think the "F" word is a down point in the movie, people in these situations, scared, pumped with adrenaline, and bursting with attitude often are depicted in this manner, to me, I hardly noticed the "F" word during the whole movie.
Thumbs up for this one!
