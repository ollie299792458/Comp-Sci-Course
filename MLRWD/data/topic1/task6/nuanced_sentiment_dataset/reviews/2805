I had seen the movie in stores and passed it by, even though I really like Daryl Hannah. Then, a week ago I began reading the book after my mom found it in a thrift store. I absolutely loved it! It has to be my all time favorite book ever, and I get bored easily with some books, especially ones that have to do with the cave man era. (I will admit that the first 20-30 pages of the book I was wondering what was going on with the clan, but I hung in there and it was WELL worth it!)
I bought the DVD yesterday, extremely excited to see the movie.
Boy, I got lost in some of the parts and I had just finished the book! I really thought the Harry Potter book to movie adaptions were bad and then I saw this. Bleck! I realize a lot of details needed to be left out (it is, after all a 500 page book) but some of the most important ones that showed the emotions and less evolved thinking of the clan that was very important shouldn't have been! One thing I noticed was that the movie spared no time in the 'rape' scenes of Daryl Hannah. C'mon, don't you think there were more important things you could have concentrated on? It wasn't even 10% of the book, but it made up for 30% of the movie. And important parts of the movie such as Ayla's first period, or even the birth of her child were all together forgotten or molested. I didn't like the movie at all- I wish they would do a mini-series or "The Stand" type movie where its 6 hours long. Who cares? Enough people love the book that they would buy it and find the time to watch it, I know I would. After watching this movie, I definatly think it is worth a do-over. And, for people who loved the movie, I'm glad for you. I just don't think it did the book justice. My boyfriend even said that if the book was anything like the movie he wasn't reading it all..How many other people had that same opinion after seeing this wretched 'masterpiece'.
