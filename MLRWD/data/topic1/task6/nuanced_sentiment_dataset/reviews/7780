There are many glowing reviews of this DVD set submitted here, and much of what has been written I agree with. While it is true there is much to be said for this history of New York, I feel that it could have been said in about 4 or 5 fewer hours. There is far too much time devoted to talking heads speaking philosophically about New York, often repeating themselves. or each other, over and over. These experts often do have important comments to add, but they are allowed to do 2 or 3 times. Wonderful historic clips are often cut short to return to another talking head.
Burns also obviously loves the arial fly over video of NYC, as this clip, with variations, appears far too frequently. I doubt that more than 10 mins. of the film goes by without another arial fly over. Never mind that the film may be disscussing 17th century NYC, Burns has to throw in another fly over of contemporary Manhattan!
I found the music to be very dissapointing as well. In order to keep a sort of dark and somber mood throughout the film, Burns uses the same 4 or 5 music clips over and over again. By the last DVD I was quite sick of them. We do get a little bit of other clips - but "Sidewalks of New York" was not the only tune about N.Y. We get a tiny slice of Gershwin, and a few other tidbits but with all of the wonderful music that has come out of N.Y. over the last 100 years, there should have been much much more offered.
Keeping in mind that there really isn't anything else like this set, I would still recommend it. It is just in need of a good editor......
