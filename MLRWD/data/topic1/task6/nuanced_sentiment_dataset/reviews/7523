I never tire of this movie....how in the world could you?  This is by no means a "chick flick," although women everywhere love this movie...guys love the basketball....and everyone loves the soundtrack.  The movie sizzles because of the obvious chemistry between Lathan and Epps...which, as it turns out, was completely genuine.  Lathan stars as the adorable Monica, and Epps as Quincy; Monica moves into the house next door, and Quincy, the son of an NBA basketball great, has finally met someone whose love for the sport surpasses even his own.  The two immediately develop a love/hate relationship, as children do...and as they mature, Monica's feelings develop into the real thing.  But Quincy has trouble seeing past her basketball uniform, and it is not until the pivotal high school dance that he sees her as the beautiful young woman she is becoming, and realizes that he himself feels the same way.  The two go on to date seriously while in college---even attending the same school.  The climactic moment comes--however subtle--when Monica inadvertently chooses basketball over love...and their relationship ends.  The story continues, as Monica moves overseas in an effort to realize her dream of playing professional basketball, and Quincy suffers a career-ending injury--after leaving college early to play in the NBA.  Life has moved on...but Monica cannot, finding that she can love no one else.  Ultimately, life, love and happiness hang in the balance as the star-crossed lovers participate in a final game of one-on-one...but by far their most important one ever.

I love everything about this movie...from the humor, the great one liners, to the division of the tale into 4 quarters---indicative of a basketball game.

If you want a genuinely good movie, with a little something for everyone, plus some foot-tapping music thrown in for good measure...this is NOT to be missed!
