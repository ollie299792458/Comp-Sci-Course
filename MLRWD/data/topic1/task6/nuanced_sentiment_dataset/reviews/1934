One star, not because "8mm" was poorly directed or had poor acting - it was not and did not.  Not because the subject matter was not based in reality, because it was.  Not because it was not suspenseful or  even scary, because it certainly was that as well.  But one star because  this movie is devoid of any redeeming value whatsoever, and because of the  powerfully negative effect it has had on its viewers.  The logical sequel  to a movie this dark and disturbing would be "Secrets of the Medieval  Torture Chambers."  
I don't buy the justification that "this  is just another realistic reminder of what evil men are capable of doing to  innocent people."  That's what "60 Minutes" and  "Cops" do on a weekly basis, and without the opressive darkness  of this film.
If there are not enough kidnappings, rapes, and mutilations  in real life for you, then this flick should provide a fresh and intense  infusion of gore and morbidity.  But if you've had enough of the darkness  and death, then you will surely want to avoid this experience at all costs.  
Early on, P.I. Welles (Cage) struggles with the dilemma of "how  can a person unsee something he/she afterward regrets seeing?"  Good  question to ponder!  You can rewind the tape, but unfortunately, none of us  can rewind our minds.
