Many have allready noted the positive elements of this movie and I am only reverberating their comments.  This movie is a masterpiece.  In my opinion no actor has portrayed Christ as human and mystical as Robert Powell.  He gave a trully sublime performance.  Although this role may have type casted him in the states, he still had a very fruitful career.

  The Casting was exceptional, and although this is made for TV miniseries, it still holds up after all these years for many reasons.  Anne Bancroft's portrayal of Mary Magdalane was also very inspirational.  One of the strengths of this production was it's minimalism.  The soundtrack and main theme were great and memorable as well.

  The only negative I would give on this DVD production is that it was not re-mastered.  The copy on this DVD appears to have scratches that have transferred from the film itself and color balance could be better.
Perhaps the real studio master is lost, who knows, but I suggest they uncover it and completely re-master the video.  Also, there are no extras.  It would be great to have an interview with Robert Powell and perhaps other actors from the movie.
