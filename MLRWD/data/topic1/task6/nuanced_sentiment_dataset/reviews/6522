This film has always been a favourite of mine and is the last of great video nasties to be released on dvd, i was really exited about this finally being released by code red after about 5 years, how disappionted was i when i finally watched it. While the colors and the sharpeness of the picture is alot better than any video release i've seen of this film, the amount of marks, lines and scratches is not, it looks like code red did no cleaning up of the film at all and the extra's are pretty much worthless as well, an interview in italian only is just totally wrong and disgraceful and the interviews with ed french and baird staford are so short with terrrible picture quality and sound, looks like they were filmed with a normal video camera. I really don't no how some of these reviewers can say that this is a good release it is terrible. It would of been better if they put all there time and money on just releasing one version of the film and cleaning it right up and leaving out all the extra's. What a missed opportunity especially the interview with scavolini. I have the old british pre cert of this film and while it is cut the print is a damn sight better than this print and the old video for pleasure dutch uncut version is about the same riddled with marks and lines which prooves they did no cleaning up of the prnt at all. Code red have gone about the same way as MYA communications have, there first few releases are good then they have just gone down hill from there on in, putting out poor releases of some good films.
