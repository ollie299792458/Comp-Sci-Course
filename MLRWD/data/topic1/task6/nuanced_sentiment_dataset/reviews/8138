Heroes is a serial saga about people all over the world discovering that they have superpowers and trying to deal with how this change affects their lives.

Some of the superheroes includes Peter Petrelli, a male nurse who suspects he might be able to fly; Isaac Mendez, a junkie who has the ability to paint images of the future when he is high; Niki Sanders, a Las Vegas showgirl who does things that are mysteriously connected with mirrors; Hiro Nakamura, a Japanese comic-book geek who literally makes time stand still; D.L. Hawkins, an inmate who can walk through walls; Matt Parkman, a beat cop who can hear other people's thoughts; and Claire Bennet, a cheerleader who defies death at every turn.

As we discover the nature of each hero's powers, the heroes, themselves, are discovering what having superpowers means to them as well as the larger picture of where their superpowers come from.

See how these heroes are drawn together by their common interest of evading the series' antagonist who wants to harvest their super-DNA for himself. Their ultimate destiny is nothing less than saving the world!
