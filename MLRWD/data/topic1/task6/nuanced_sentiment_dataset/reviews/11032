Holy crap, was this *bad*. I want those two hours of my life back! If they were trying for a parody with this movie, it didn't work. If they were trying for serious, god help them. I can't remember the last time I saw something this horrible, this badly acted. I'd say the plot holes were gaping, but that would require it having a plot.

On one hand, Bruce Campbell was in it and he can make pretty much anything watchable. But on the other, he really didn't look like he was having a good time and that makes a big difference. Renee O'Connor looked like she wasn't too happy to be there, either, but between her and Bruce, at least there were two people who had clue one about acting. The rest of the cast? Dear god. And the special effects? Haven't seen anything this bad since the original Star Trek.

In a way, though, it was a little reminiscent of watching Hercules. Bad wigs, bad fake beards, horrid accents (all the "bounty hunters" sounded like natives of backwoods Virginia), but both Xena and Hercules would be up for Emmys in comparison to this pile of stinking crap. I felt sorry for both Bruce and Renee for being in this.
