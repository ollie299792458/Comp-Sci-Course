the reason i chose the trilogy instead of individually is primarilly because john mclain is not a one movie man,and all three films have to be compared. "die hard" made willis an action star. hell,it made the  action genre,that people seem to give arnold credit for. the first movie  truly is the best action movie you will ever see made,bar none.  however...."die harder" and "with a vengence" also had  a lot of merits,and can even surpass the original for sheer enjoyment.  "dh1" takes place in la,as we become introduced to ny detective  john mclean,an ordinary guy in an extrordinary circumstance. but he is a  cop,which lends plausablity to his actions and reactions. mclean just wants  to get back with his wife,the beautiful bonnie bedilia,who also appears in  "dh2" as an airline passanger who is on a plane destined for  disaster. bruce,in the airport,tries to prevent the planes from hitting the  ground and the bad guys from leaving the ground. guess who wins...all  kidding aside,this sequel matched the ernestness of the original,lending  creedence to the obvious "oh here we go again" syndrome, which  does give this entry a lighter tone. but it also lends itself more to  repeat viewing. now in "dh3", john tiernan,the director of the  original, returns and puts bruce back in his element,the greatest city in  the world,and boy do they have fun with it. along for the ride are samual  l.jackson as a good samaritan,and the extremly underated jeremy irons as  the villian. this feature plays upon cat and mouse tactics beautifully,and  for that reason alone,makes for the most repeat viewings. but it certainly  doesn't hurt to have mr.irons presence,and mr.tiernan's eye. sorry star  wars fans,but this is the best trilogy around.
