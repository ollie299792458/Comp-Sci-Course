For anyone born in the 1970's, it was nearly impossible to avoid being exposed to cartoons by Hanna-Barbera Productions (e.g., The Jetsons, Jonny Quest, The Super Friends, Scooby Doo, et al).  Throughout the 1970's and early 1980's, these cartoons were at the epicenter of the "Saturday Morning Cartoon Phenomenon," and collectively they created an indelible impression on a "Junk Cereal" eating generation.
Now, 30+ years later, the Adult Swim faction at Comedy Central presents a spot-on spoof of the mass production cartooning made popular by Hanna-Barbera Productions.  True to form for Adult Swim contributions, the episodes are filled with crude, sophomoric humor aimed at young male populations.  There are funny moments, but much of it is fairly predictable (e.g., hyperbolic gay stereotypes, male cartoon "mooning," double entendre penis jokes, public sexual activity, bathroom humor, etc.)
My favorite episodes involve: 1) Apache Chief (who, after spilling a cup of hot coffee in his lap, loses his power to grow super-sized and decides to sue the coffee shop). 2) Scooby Doo and Shaggy (who are arrested for narcotic possesion).  3) Fred Flintstone (who is now the "Don" of a mafia syndicate in Bedrock).

Overall, the episodes were a nice bit of irreverent nostalgia; I was impressed by the fact that they brought out many obscure characters, some of whom I had completely forgotton about (e.g., "Inch High, Private Eye").  However, much like the cheaply produced and highly repetitive Hanna-Barbera cartoons to which they pay hommage, it started to get a little bit boring after watching multiple episodes.  I might try to borrow subsequent volumes of this series, but I'm not particularly interested in purchasing any of them.
