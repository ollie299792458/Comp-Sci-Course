"Space Cowboys" is a parable about redemption at the trailing edge of mortality.  In their youth, the four central characters (Eastwood, Jones, Garner and Sutherland) almost became the first men in space.  Now elderly, they are all facing and defying death, each in his own way:  Jones as a stunt flyer, Sutherland test pilots roller coasters, etc.  Suddenly, in a twist of fate, they are called to Heaven ... in a space shuttle!  And in that wonderful moment the lost opportunities, failures, disappointments and regrets in their past are all washed away.  
Sounds like a great story full of symbolism and sub-text.  But the rich thematic elements are undermined by a weak script, sub-par performances and poor direction.
>The action scenes were confusing and left me bewildered about what was happening.  A preamble set in the 1950s clumsily uses black and white, lots of shadows and voice overdubbing to portray the protagonists as young men.  It was pretty obvious.
What we're left with is basically a remake of "Space Camp" with oldsters instead of youngsters.  The producers may have thought four big stars is better than two, but the movie still only gets two stars from me.
