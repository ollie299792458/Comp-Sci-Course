The irony of a well-reviewed movie (two thumbs up) is that when you get it home you have to wonder why you are just not getting it.  Maybe some other viewers will see the logic in the thrown food (Is weathermen common victims of this abuse?  Al Roker, did he ever get pelted by a Big Mac?), or understand the bizarre man I kept thinking was going to be taken away by men in their clean white coats, but for me, most of the movie was slow and tedious.

Michael Caines character seemed to add more weight hinting that truly there was something interesting under the surface of this man, although he also had that "saying too little" thing going which never truly resolved.

In short, if you like a movie that has you on the edge of your seat, makes you laugh out loud, is tightly plotted, or connects with you personally this might not be for you (unless you are a totally depressed weatherman with two really messed up kids).  However, if you like something like Crimes and Punishment, or you can spend hours philosophizing on Kafka you might find this a gem.
