In a world where men womanize and then cheat on their women, this movie got down to basics when Zach (Dane Cook) learns he must court Miss Amy (Jessica Simpson) to be the better man than the lead cashier - whom Amy always finds attractive since he's always the Employee of the Month. In fact, the lead cashier has been EOM so many times, he is about to make a record. Well of course, in the pursuit of a girl, a contest is forged... and the steps taken will have you laughing til your sides hurt - if you're into slapstick comedy, and the Dane Cook sense of humor.

What I found was not the foul mouthed, women are a dime a dozen Dane, but Zach was a guy with a sweet and tender heart under his male pride... sensitive, yet with a streak you need to watch out for.

I laughed so hard - and halfway thru the movie leaned to my husband and said - we are buying this when it comes out on DVD - and yes, we have already pre-bought it! I cannot wait - such a heartwarming tale and funny too! Way to go EOM and it's cast & producers!
