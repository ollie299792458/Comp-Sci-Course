SPOILER ALERT? O.K. Depending on how sensitive to certain aspects of what follows you are, (stay with me, this becomes- I Hope- clearer) there may be any number of spoilers involved... or not.
 First, we have to deal with the whole aspect of a picture with a "twist" ending. No that's not a spoiler, films like this always have a twist ending. But that's the problem! Just knowing there is one can, if you're into films like this, give the ending away! As an old-time fan of weird flicks I, and quite a few of my friends, figured out the "twist" of "The Sixth Sense" once we knew there was one. Sure the first reviewers were stunned, but we knew immediately that either A) Willis was dead B) the kid was dead or C) they both were. Then it was only an exercise in seeing how well it was done. Conversely, none of us quite figured out the twist of "The Usual Suspects" if only because it was so arbitrary. While "Spiral" is nowhere near as good as the two films above, it is well made, has some very clever (and not unfunny) dialogue and a twist that, while not on a par with "Sixth Sense" is certainly more earned than "Suspects". PLUS it has Amber Tamblyn and that means it is worth seeing. And it has a pre-Chuck Zachary Levi who's always interesting. In short, it's a pretty good example of the kind of B movie suspense film they not only DO still make, they make a lot worse than this one. A decent little time-killer.
