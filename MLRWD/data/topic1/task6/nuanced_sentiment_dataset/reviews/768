As a rugger I wanted to enjoy this movie very much but was very disappointed.  Richard Harris' Frank Machin character rocks back and forth between angry tirades and sadness, with no nuance at all to the character.  The actress playing the lonely widow with whom he lives displays almost nothing but contempt throughout the film, and their first romantic scene (a semi-rape) seems incredulous. The story becomes convoluted: in the next scene, which takes place the next morning, he flies into a tirade as she snubs him. A little later they're happily dating, and then a scene or two later she rejects him after he acts stupidly in a restaurant. It doesn't hang together; it's as if the director filmed a bunch of angry scenes between the main characters and then pieced them all together in a string,losing the flow of the storyline. Another few examples of poor directing: In an early scene Machin refers to an old man friend as "Dad" and then moments later in the film walks up to him like he doesn't even know him to ask for a tryout with the local rugby club.  Later the character is completley dropped from the film. Also, the rugby club manager befriends Machin early on, but later comes to hate him without any explanation given. As for corruption and greed affecting the poor working class, there is none mentioned.  All the viewer sees is over-acting and bad directing. I really wanted to like this movie, but was disappointed. Save your money and get another movie instead!
