I enjoyed this movie, and I gave it 3 stars...

But I was also disappointed in this movie.

First of all, for it to be promoted as a spiritual movie there was entirely too much cussing. I am far from being a prude, and those who know me are aware that I will let off a word or two.

However,as an author, I don't curse when I write Christian fiction, because when advertising something as spiritual or Christian its inappropriate.

It wasn't light cursing either, like a word here or there like in The Fighting Temptations...it was all over the place. Other than the minister, I had a hard time telling any of these cursing characters from one in any other movie.

As a writer I know I tend to over critique some stories...and this is one of them. While enjoyable...it had no rhyme or reason. It was just random drama. Perhaps that is what happens when a book becomes a movie, but in this case, it was just weird.

Again, I did enjoy the movie. It just was not at all what I was expecting, and honestly...I never saw God in this movie.

One scene with a minister and a prayer...does not make a movie spiritual.
