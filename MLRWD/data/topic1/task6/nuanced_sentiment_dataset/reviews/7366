I'm a big comic book fan and every time the decision is made to adapt a character/storyline into the visual media, I'm always skeptical. Most movies animated movies if not all that have been released be it Marvel or DC have been lackluster in my opinion. But the fact that I love comics as much as I do, I end up falling into a sort of fanboy mentality and I go ahead and buy the movies anyway just because the idea of taking a great character and story and giving it motion is too big a chance to pass up. That being said, the Planet Hulk story arc (comics) to me was incredible. I thought it was an excellent read and the various artists that showed their talents on the pages were superb. The story itself actually spans 12 issues so there was a lot of story throughout. The problem with animated movies is that they aren't that long and I can understand that watching an animated movie for a prolonged period of time might get boring but Planet Hulk was not something that should have been condensed to 81 minutes. The art was pretty good and they stayed close to the original story for the most part (with the exception of the Beta Ray Bill character replacing the Silver Surfer in the comic) but I thought some of the dialogue was weak and there really wasn't enough time to develop the character relationships the way the comic did. If you're a Hulk fan and have never read the Planet Hulk story arc (that doesn't really seem to add up huh) buy the trade. Excellent read and you'll more than likely agree with me that more of the story should have been incorporated in the feature. I think a 3 star rating for the movie is right where it stands and if you do buy the Bluray there are plenty of extra features to keep you entertained after the movie's over. One thing I did read on someone else's review is to adapt the World War Hulk story arc into an animated movie and that idea does sound awesome but the time restrictions will always be a problem with animated movies.
