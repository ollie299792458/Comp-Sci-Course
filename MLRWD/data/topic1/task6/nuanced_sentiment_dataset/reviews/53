This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. It shows very well the difficulties of the jewish population in Poland during the german occupation. One scene etched in memory is when the jewish labourers are made to wait for a long time before they are allowed to cross the road. They are worried about their jobs , about getting food on their table. The German officers , for their amusement however, make some of them dance while they wait. That was a humiliating unfeeling incident which Polanski had brought out very well.

The main story of course if about the struggle for survival by the young jewish pianist. It is a story well told and well depicted. He survives through illness, hunger and isolation and he is at last heped by a german officer. That was a heartwarming incident in the movies, the prescence of one kind german during those times surrounded by thousands who were subhuman in their cruelty. This one man had the courage to make up his own mind and follow his instinct to save a human being.
