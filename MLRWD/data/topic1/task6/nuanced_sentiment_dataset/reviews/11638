The movie seemed ok at first... the acting wasn't "bad" and it was nice to see some new faces. But that's about as good as it gets. I hate it when "Hollywood" uses CG to make all of their creatures, but at least those guys have the budget to hire someone that can do a decent job of it. The "aliens" in this movie were the end product of hiring someone that doesn't know how to run a computer to make animations for a film that relies heavily on fictitional creatures.

I could probably buy any "newer" computer game (probably from the last 5-7 years) and get better graphics than that. It ruined the entire movie. After about 5 minutes after the aliens showed up I shut it off.

I actually went back the the video store that night and told them that I wasn't going to pay for that and I wanted to exchange it for a different movie. They didn't argue about it either. I love indie films to death... but they just shouldn't do more than they have the budget for and they shouldn't be looking elsewhere to get what they want cheaper.

Although my review is based on no more than a half hour of the movie... only get this movie if you really want your eyes and ears to bleed. I'm confident that it has no redeeming qualities... at least not so much that it can make up for the horrible mess that it is. It's so bad that I wouldn't even force my enemies to watch it.
