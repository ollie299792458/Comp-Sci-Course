Die, Monster, die is a somewhat slow moving version of an H P Lovecraft story that is heavy on atmosphere and has some very good acting by the stars, especially horror film veteran Boris Karloff.

The problem with this film and many others from the '60's is that the special effects tend to be somewhat crude and done on the cheap.  "Die, Monster, Die" would have benefited greatly if they let us see more of how the people were slowly being mutated by the radiation from the meteorite that was taken into the house.  Instead, the scenes with the human mutants tend to be brief and their fatalities not that shocking at all.

However, despite these problems, I would give this film high marks for atmosphere.  Filming it at a gloomy, fog bound mansion in England was a great idea...just wish the special effects were more shocking.  I've watched the movie several times just for the atmosphere!

"The Dunwich Horror" is yet another film that desperately needed to let the audience SEE the "horror" close up as he/it attacks people. Instead we see the action from the monster's point of view as people cringe at his/its lethal approach.  To compensate for this MAJOR problem with the film we are allowed to see him/it for a few frames at the end.

TDH has an interesting premise...weird rites to allow the "Old Ones" to invade and conquer Earth, but, of course, that never happens.

I would recommend both of these films for atmosphere, but not for special effects.  Sadly, many horror / sci-fi films of the '50's and '60's suffered from this same problem...with small budgets, there wasn't alot left over for convincing props and special effects once the actors were paid.
