Sure there are some bad stuff going on in war. FOr instance the taliban cuts the heads of it's captives. It's a death sentence to get captured by the insurgents in iraq too. Although the u.s. isn't a active combatant. But what's gross about this movie is that the idiots who made it made up a fictional massacre. We have real incidents that happened with a few soldiers for sure. Like the few that were killing afgan civilians for fun, but that was three men and this tries to sell that the situation is forgone conclusion for anyone in combat. Not so, bad apples happen but to come up with this movie during a war and make up a  even worse slaughter than ever happened over there is criminal during wartime.  They could have done abu grab which was sick although noone died, or the few cases of actual slaughtering that has happened but nope they made this up and it's wrong.
because like 'the generals daughter' they claim it's true. at least other antiwar movies usually don't claim this and that's ok. this was just wrong.
