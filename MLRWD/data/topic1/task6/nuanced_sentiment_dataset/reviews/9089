"Casino" is an interesting film in many respects but it has several weaknesses. Let's start with the good: the portrait of 1970's Las Vegas is fascinating and Director Martin Scorsese  has the details perfected - right down to the clothes, home decor, and music. Scorsese and Nicolas Pileggi introduce an interesting array of characters, from Casino Director Ace (Robert Deniro), Mob Hit Guy Nicky (Joe Pesci), Vegas hooker Ginger (Sharon Stone), and sleazy pimp Lester (James Woods), among others. A stone-faced Don Rickles plays the Casino manager. This is a standard Scorsese film of excess, greed, and downfall -  and that's the problem. "Casino" seems like a film we've seen before, notably "Goodfellas," with enough head-bashing and F-bombs to more than fill the near 3-hour running time. At times, the story plods along until some bit of drama shakes things up. There are too many secondary characters that are not developed and seem insignificant. The performances are mixed: DeNiro plays Ace Rothstein as something of a victim, which is not what he does best. Pesci, in a bad wig, does a retread of his "Goodfellas" role and his grating voice and obnoxious mannerisms are not an asset. Stone gives the best performance of the film - and of her career. She is spot-on as an addict in denial headed for a dead end. This, and some interesting details, make this a good but not great film.
