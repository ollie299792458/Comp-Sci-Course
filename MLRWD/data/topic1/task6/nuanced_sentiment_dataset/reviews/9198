Too much Cubby?  As far as Bond's go, Timothy Dalton had a great dark  portrayl. Originally titled "License Revoked," Producer Cubby  Brocolli-Cauliflower didn't EVER want James Bond to be kicked off the  service. This from the same guy who didn't want his macho hero to cry when  his wife died in "On her Majesty's Secret Service." (Poor George  Lazenby!)
Anyway...good concept, but needed a second rewrite. Opening  "action" sequence just wasn't thrilling. Motive for revenge--best  friend is mutilated by sharks, his partner and Bond cohort murdered,  newlywedded ex-Three's Company chick killed on wedding night (and was she  sexually assualted?)--all this was building up to a poignant and touching  ending.  
What do we get for a payoff?  A healthy-looking Felix (who  seems to have no missing digits from being the main course at a shark  buffet) laughing with James Bond with that "Oh, you rascal, thanks for  risking your life and career and I'll see you at the next poker night"  attitude. 
Smile! You're on Candid Bond Camera!
