Its supposed to be "science" fiction not science absurdity. When the "scientist" takes off his helmet 30 minutes into it you know things are going to go down hill. I would say a 3rd grader would know better than to do that. Needless to say the CGI and locations are impressive, that's pretty easy now days, but really almost anyone could improve the story. A child could have improved the story. The monster had to get on board, the way it does that is just beyond belief. Suspension of disbelief is part of any movie but this one... stretches that to absurd levels. Almost as if they tried to write a script in a week for a 125 million dollar movie. Why the hell would they do that? Totally sloppy. I mean really REALLY sloppy. Did they mix up pages from the round file? Story makes no sense even from the creation point of "mystery" view.

I'd almost rather they used the entire time to fly the camera over Scotland and Iceland which are so beautiful in their harshness. Forget the "science fiction" just give me visuals of the beautiful landscapes.
