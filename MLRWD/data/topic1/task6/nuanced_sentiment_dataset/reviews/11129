"Well, we sure sold out of those Dark Shadow Limited edition sets quickly Mr. MPI CEO, what are we going to do next? I know Billy, we'll reduce costs by eliminating the signed photo of the star, completely do away with the booklet, and get rid of those fancy "limited edition" stickers. We'll take the exact same product and call it "deluxe" and charge people $125 more although there getting less (a lot less) than what we originally offered." You're a genius Mr. MPI CEO, how do you do it?

Folks, there is something inherently wrong with what MPI did. It's called bad business! To those who preordered the "limited" your "limited editions" aren't really limited now, are they? sure, the suckers who buy this set wont get the booklet or the signature but they are essentially getting what you got. on the other hand, folks who buy this set are really being taken advantage of..... I repeat. TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF!!!!!!!!!!! I don't want to hear about supply and demand OR "we should be thanking them.". I do thank them for producing, I resent and despise their lame attempt to capitalize on the situation at the last second. DISPICKABLE! They should really be ashamed. I will not buy this even though I can most certainly afford it and would appreciate having it in my vast collection
