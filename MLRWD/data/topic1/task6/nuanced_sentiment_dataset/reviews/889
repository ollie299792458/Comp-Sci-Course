The African Queen is one of my all time favorite movies period.I was very young when I first saw this movie and marvelled later when my youngest son sat glued to the tv, in wonderment at this ragged steamboat and the adventures it sailed its two passengers  into, for the steamboat is a third character in this movie, very broadly based on C. S. Forester's novel, set in WWII Africa and director John Huston directs with a sure hand with I imagine injecting humor that is not in the book. The great writer James Agee conributed to the scipt (an suffered a heart attack playing tennis with Huston but lived to finish the script) and the meeting and mating of the gin-soaked steamboat captain (Bogart) and Christian missonary (Hepburn) clash at first but slowly but wonderfully touching and funny find each other and need each other for survival, love and even high spirits. Filmed in Africa with beautiful cinematography. Of interst are the book wrote by Hepburn about her adventures making the African Queen and the novel "White Hunter, Black Heart" by Peter Viertel, then husband of the actress Deborah Kerr, whose barely fictionized portrait of John Huston was filmed by Clint Eastwood. But those are only stories to sidetrack you. The movie itself is a precious, funny, adventure, well-acted and directed and a true classic that can entrall the whole family. A great film.
