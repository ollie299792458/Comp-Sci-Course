Sin Nombre is the best movie I've ever seen. I walked out of the theater knowing I'd never had a cinematic experience quite like it. I didn't know what to expect when I went in, not having heard too much about it beforehand. From the moment it began, I was captured. The music combined with the shot itself was a harbinger of the amazing film to come. A gripping story with beautiful cinematography and wonderful actors, Sin Nombre is the kind of movie that moves you and then stays with you long after you leave your seat.
This is a film described by one of its actors, Diana Garcia, as "tough and sweet at the same time." It's about gang violence in Central America (and one gang member in particular), the struggle of a family (along with many other immigrants) to cross the border into a better life, and a love story (all of which are intertwined). It's about terrible injustice, hope, and human kindness coming out of the most desperate of situations. On top of all of that, there is edge-of-your-seat action that not only left my heart beating but caused me to really care about what was going to happen to the characters. This movie will break your heart with its truthfulness. There is so much to love about this film, it has everything. It's unique as well, in the way that much of it is filmed on top of a moving freight train.
Sin Nombre deserves to win Best Picture. Although it did very well at Sundance and the Edinburgh Film Festival, I fear it may remain where many foreign language films do, quietly appreciated by a relative few. I hope I'm wrong.
