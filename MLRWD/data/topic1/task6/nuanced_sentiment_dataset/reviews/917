I'd never had an interest in seeing this movie, but my dad had rented it so I watched it while visiting. I equate this movie to Coyote Ugly, it's not bad if you're willing to just let your mind go.
The plot is pretty straight forward: Johnathon Cross, and extreme sports junkie, is persuaded by a friend to play Rollerball, a cross between soccer, rollerblading, and anything goes that's being played in Asia. He becomes the start player for his team, enjoys all the perks, including getting cozy with a fellow teammate, and then discovers that the owners of the teams are staging fights and accidents to boost ratings. His conscience kicks in, and he tries to find a way to stop it.
The special effects in the movie are nice, they scenes are patched together so it really looks like they're playing the game, flying through the air, and doing a bunch of stunts. The costumes are flashy, everyone has their own unique style, from a gladiator down to someone in a tutu. Everything is done in a flashy way, with lots of sparks or flashy lights.
The soundtrack fits the movie, there's hard rock for the games and parties and slower music for other scenes. The Rob Zombie song is well picked, it fits in with the style of the movie. What I liked best about the music is that you didn't really notice it, there weren't points that stood out and made you go "Why on earth did they pick that piece?"
Overall I'd give it 3 stars. The first is for the music, it was appropriate. The second star is for the costumes and set design, it really made the movie more substantial, although not by much. And, the third star would be for a simple plot that's hard to screw up. Rollerball isn't the next great movie, but it's one that can be fun to watch if you let your brain go.
