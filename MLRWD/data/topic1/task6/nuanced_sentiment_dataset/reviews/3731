So many film-makers have tried to hit my "Apocalyptic funny bone" and missed. Bergman nailed it with this film. The first thing you hear in the movie is a quote from Revelation, so you know where he's aiming.

Set in a Medieval Europe racked by the plague, each of the stark characters in the film shows a certain attitude in the face of Death which is a personified, stark reality revealed in the film. Some fight him, some run from him, some embrace him, some deny him. In the end, their attitudes toward Death reveals their ultimate attitude toward God and the meaning of their own lives. Very dark, but also comical in many places, not for the weak-hearted - we see pentinents flaggelating themselves as well as a witch burning which was haunting to be and absolutely horrifying to my wife.

Within the horrors of the film we see a simple family of mystery players who ultimately escape the plague and who seem to be a symbol of the good in suffering humanity as well as the Holy Family (the husband and wife are named Mary and Joseph). They are saved by the Knight who is literally shown playing chess with the Death character.

Anyone who has ever doubted in matters of faith and come through it intact will appreciate this film as well as lovers of truly great cinema as art. But f your favorite film is Die Hard 3 then you had better pass on this.
