Strangely similar to Groundhog Day, except that the Drew Barrymore has no clue she's living the same day over and over. I can see why they thought this would make for an interesting movie. It sounds good in theory, it even sounds funny if you were talking about it - like if you were to pitch the movie to a producer. "See, it's about this girl that has this accident where she loses all short term memory. And you know, just think of it...how can she ever date anyone? See the potential? See the humor??? We could even get Adam Sandler to star!"

Sadly, however, the movie doesn't succeed as well as the pitch. Maybe it's the screenwriter's fault. Too many jokes at the expense of those with head injuries. A guy can't remember anything beyond 10 seconds. Haha, yeah, so funny. Whoa, until you think about it for a moment and realize how horrible life would be for that guy. Depressing.

Not a bad movie, because sometimes it's funny, but the seriousness of the subject (brain damage - an injury that never heals) sort of brings down any feel-good charm they are trying to convey. The ending is actually more sad than uplifting. I almost wanted to cry. I don't mind crying, but dang it - make up your mind what sort of movie this is, guys. Comedy or tearjerker! Gah.
