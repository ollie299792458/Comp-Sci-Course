I first saw this film way back in the mid 80s while I was much younger and couldnt appreciate the creativity, pain, and outright wildness of how this movie was made.

Basically just a handful of creative kids with no money going nuts and among other things, doing all their own stunts, firing off real shotguns in to real glass directly in front of their real faces.

Although I havent seen too many dvds with commentary, Evil Dead with the 2 different commentary tracks is the best Ive seen yet as the director, producer, and actor all give non stop insight and depth about the film instead of just rehashing whats going on on the screen ala book report style like some commentary does.

Im not involved in the film industry but after watching the cast and crew romp thru this challenging production (that took a few years) it reminded me of some of the times when I was younger, totally in my element and focused working on projects also with reckless abandon.

For those that havent seen it....It is low budge, gory, action packed, interestingly filmed (odd angles and movements with the camera), classic mythological story, and has an intriguing soundtrack.  Dont expect the gloss of your typical flavor of the month multi million dollar Hollywood FX film though as this is not that type of movie.

I enjoyed Bruce Campbell's commentary as he had a lot to say (unlike Kurt Russel in the Thing commenetry that couldnt even remember most of the movie), came across as sharp, witty, and funny.  The commenatry by the director and producer was also well done and delivers.

Horror and gore aside, if someone is interested in rags to riches stories as they relate to creating films and if one also wants to peer into the unglamourous and tediuos side of making films than the Evil Dead Special Edition may be worth it.
