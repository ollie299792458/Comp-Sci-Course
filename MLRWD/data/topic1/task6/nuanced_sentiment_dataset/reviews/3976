I am a big fan of 'A Christmas Carol.'  I have several adaptations on video, including this one.
I was a little disappointed in Mr. Stewart's performance.  It may be that he was burnt out after doing his one-man performance of 'A Christmas Carol' (of which I have the CD, and enjoy it).
Stewart's 'Scrooge', IMHO, departs from the 'Scrooge' Dickens gives to us, and this, at pivitol points in the movie.  To me, Stewart's 'Scrooge' is at times too pragmatic.  It's as though Captain Picard is playing the role of Scrooge in the hollow-deck.  Again this is not a slight to Mr. Stewart (whom I admire as an actor).
Overall the script is very well written.  There are some instances where the dialog is deftly turned and very fresh, yet keeping with the spirit of the novel ("Nail, knob, or knocker, he's dead....").  Some elements of Dickens novel that are absent from other adaptations are present and welcome.
The supporting cast is great.  I especially enjoyed Bernard Lloyd's performance as Jacob Marley.  And the slant given the 'Turkey Boy' (played by Billy Seymour) is fresh yet not out of line with what his attitude may have been.
The special effects are very well done.  From Marley's chin dropping to his chest to the transitional effects which move us from one scene to another.  The only drawback was seeing the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (he looked like a giant Jawa).
While I would recommend this movie (it is better than the adaptation with Mr. Simm and on par with the one starring the late George C. Scott), I only wish that Mr. Stewart would have given us a 'Scrooge' which was more in line with Dickens' version.
Bottom line: Not, "Bah, humbug." But not, "God bless us, everyone."
