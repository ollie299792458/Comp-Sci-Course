I was in a video store one day, I was searching through the charts when I came across it, bearing in mind the amount of controversy it generated.  I was at first reluctant and at the same time curious to see the film, but my curiously won over.
When I watched it I was shocked and violated, I can sincerely understand people's reaction to this film, its beyond blasphemous, and it's an abomination against the Holy Scriptures, I felt as if I committed a sin just watching it. 
For all those who defend this film, which can only be anti-Christian's or members of other religion who would happily see Christianity's image tarnished.  This movie will only prove the bible's credibility in terms of it prophesying the twisting of the truth.
I'm a Christian Orthodox, an Assyrian for that matter, for those who never heard of the Assyrians, we are one of the first people to adapt to Christianity and also to speak the language of Christ (Aramaic), and it's devastating to see my saviour portrayed the way he was in the film.
I do not wish to discuss the film's content nor wish to recommend it to anyone who is a faithful Christian. Like I said, this film will only prove the bible's prophesies.
May God forgive those who are responsible.
