With a big thanks to Chris Colombus, he did not dumb down the second installment of this book series to film.  This time around, the actors seemed even more confident with themselves and as students...just where they should be.  The bonding between the characters has become quite evident, Snape's dislike for Harry seems to have grown a bit, the addition of the other teachers introduced in the second book were almost perfect (the narcisstic traits of Gilderory could have been expanded a bit more), seeing the Weasley's at home was a treat, and the flying car and whomping willow were all pulled off the way it should be. While watching the movie, I couldn't help but have a bit of sadness knowing that the late Richard Harris will no longer be playing Dumbledore in the upcoming films.  I'm glad he had a chance to expand his role in this film, and whoever takes over the role is going to have some pretty big shoes to fill, but since the track record of the first two films has been established, I feel confident the right person will be chosen.  Again, the only real complaint I have is that it wasn't long enough.
