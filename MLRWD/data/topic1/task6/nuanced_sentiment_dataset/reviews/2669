I'll repeat the title of the review.  It's not the movie.  I think Kurosawa is just amazing, and I feel this film is fantastic.  I already owned the other DVD release of this film and I ordered this one because honestly, the picture quality of the other is harsh to watch.  And it's true this version is much cleaner, but they changed the aspect ratio.  Ran was shot originally in a 1:85:1 ratio.  For this new DVD they scanned it into the computer using an HD system, and chopped the frame from 1:85:1 to 16:9.  It's hard to really compare the two ratios, but being a film geek when I started the film immediately I knew something was wrong when the image was bigger and the end of Kurosawa's name was chopped off.  I pulled out my old version of Ran, and threw it on my computer and played the opening titles side by side.  Sure enough, the edges of the film have been chopped off.  Now, this won't bother most people.  But for a film student like myself, it bothers me to see people mess with someone else's art in this manner.  It's worse than Lucas butchering Star Wars or Spielberg and ET (albeit not by much) because it isn't even their film!  Other films have been cleaned up and placed on to DVD without distorting the image, many Kurosawa films in fact.  It bothered me to see it, and I was pretty let down, this is just a fair warning to anyone else like me.
