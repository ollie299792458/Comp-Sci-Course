***********SPOILER ALERT*************

First of all, let me start with the positive aspects of the film. It is technically brillant. The scenes with Tilda Swinton(always good) in Russia were excellent--wish there had been more of them.

Now for the negative:

1. I read that the director was intent on not making an overly sentimental film--big
  mistake considering the subject matter. For example--when Benjamin finally dies
  as a baby--Daisy doesn't even shed a single tear. I know an argument can be made
  that she lost him a long time ago as he became "younger" and senility crept in.
  But even so, when you finally do lose the love of your life. why not look at him
  and say "goodbye" and cry a little--as he is gone forever?

2. The chemistry between Benjamin and Daisy was curiously lacking. When they finally
  "meet in the middle" and have a life together--why not show more scenes of them
  being happy and what attracted them to one another? The early childhood scenes
  were touching---but---we as an audience needed more to convince us they really
  were in love.

3. The hospital scenes went on and on and on. Some serious editing was clearly
  needed here. I always hated when we left the main story to go "back" to the
  hospital story--except for the parentage revealing scene.

4. Brad Pitt seemed to be "walking through" his role. I know he was nominated for
  an Academy Award for this--but this is not his best role. Probably not his
  fault---the fault lies within the screenplay--as we never "connect" with
  Benjamin.

  Alas, everybody's a critic.
