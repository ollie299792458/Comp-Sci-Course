i dont understand why anyone is giving this film a 4 or 5 star rating, in my opinion it is a one star if that. this movie is nothing like jane austen's pride and prejudice instead what we have is an american version with hollywood glam of the 1940's. lets start with the sets and costumes...

1. the sets that they used were nothing compared to what would have been in the time the story was supposed to take place. it's supposed to be in england in the early 1800's instead what we see is america's south with american old west style building interiorly and out. that would be like making a 60's movie with 90's building doesn't quite make sense.
2. the costumes are nothing what you would have seen in the english time period but were instead americanized fashion from 20-30 years in the future from the time it would take place.
3. now down to the acting. Mr. Darcy is nothing like the Mr. Darcy of jane austen fame instead we see a 1940's AMERICAN hollywood actor showing way TOO MUCH emotion for the character he is supposed to play he doesn't have the proudness or the lack of ability to speak having a hard time with strangers the way he should of. and this version of elizabeth's got nothing on Jane's.
4. it should be in british accent we are supposed to be in england aren't we?
5. go watch pride and prejudice the bbc 1995 mini series with colin firth as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth you won't regret it and you will instead get a true interpretation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.
