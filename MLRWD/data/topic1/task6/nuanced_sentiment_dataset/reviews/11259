This is not a review of the movie The Frighteners but of Amazon.com and their policy of bleeding reviews from one DVD of a movie over to another regardless of how different they are.

You have to hand it to Amazon.com. The anti-film heads who run the site have never meet one version of a DVD a movie that they didn't consider exactly like another. Amazon.com repeatedly bleeds reviews from older DVDs into newer one. So even if the DVD is a different version of the film than the previous one (in this case Amazon brings together reviews of the directors cut of The Frighteners with those of the theatrical version) or if the new DVD is a better or worse transfer relative to the earlier DVD (there are numerous instances where reviews of a poor quality DVD by one company are bled together even if the newer DVD is done by quality companies like The Criterion Collection) Amazon.com doesn't care. Instead Amazon's policy is to merge reviews of previous DVD releases with those of later DVD releases creating, in the process, a kind of postmodernist hogepodge where real differences in DVD technology or content no longer matter.

I guess postmodernism has indeed triumphed.
