Wow, where do i begin?  This "movie" is so bad i felt i needed to share my opinion.  The first 15 minutes you are treated to a strobe light show that could easily invoke a seizure.  I could almost picture the director yelling "Action! Ok more strobe light! Yes Yes! Faster!" Eden Log's plotline reminds me of a bargain bin pc adventure game.  If i were in control of the character with my mouse and keyboard it would have been more bearable, but sadly you are not in control, you will need some serious endurance to sit through this film.  The story is THE most incomprehensible mess i have ever attempted to decipher and i failed.  I watched this all the way to the end and it still makes absolutley no sense.  I won't "spoil" any of the lousy story elements for you, mainly because they are already spoiled for you.  The camera work in this film is just plain bad, its so shaky and dark its hard to tell if the main character is in the same room or has he moved on.  Anyway, if you are one of those people that loves a challenge, i challenge you to sit through this movie.  Im going to go ahead and brand it the "Worst Film I have ever sat through".  Its a steaming pile of Eden Logs, enjoy!
