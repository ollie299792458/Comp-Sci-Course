I really find it amusing how these movie snobs get on here and shoot down others reviews when they don't see it the way they do.the point of making a review is giving you're "opinion" wither it's good or bad it's still an opinion and everyone has a right to it, I've seen The Proposition a couple of times and it's far from being poetry in motion, have these geniuses ever thought maybe no one "got it" cause there's nothing to get? this movie is dreary and bloody and half the time it doesn't even know what it wants to do. the main character walks and stands around in a trance for most of the film, he didn't appear to be a man on a heated hunt for his elder brother to save his younger one. in fact they found him half dead, after that the movie just started to make less and less sense, in the final act we are treated to the senseless beating of a man and even more senseless attempted raping of the mans wife, the other brother who finally decides to come out of lala land long enough to put an end to the other twos bloody rampage once and for all. long after the credits are rolling you try to make sense of this thing, but no matter how hard you try it just does not add up, I'm not exactly sure what the director was going for and I'm not too sure if he knows himself but it certainly didn't seem to project on the screen too well. however I'm giving it 3 stars for the many scenic shots of Australia they were quite lovely to look at. and now may the film mutts be let out of their cages to tell me the error of my ways and that I just didn't "get it"
