Trust me, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, and i even went to the first showing the day it came out.  And up until the title was shown, i enjoyed it.  The part at the beginning with the middle-aged white people singing "Shake Ya Ass" by Mystikal was pretty damn funny.  And I even liked the Exorcist rip off, especially James Woods as the priest.  After that, however, things took a nose-dive off of Mt. Everest. The plot is that seven kids participate in a weekend long study at a haunted mansion (ala "The Haunting").  While they are there, starange things happen, and suddenly they are trapped inside the mansion (ala "The Haunting" and "House On Haunted Hill"), where they must confront the ghost so they can escape.  During the duration of the movie, many movies are spoofed.  Just to name a few: Hollow Man, Charlie's Angels, Mission: Impossible 2, and What Lies Beneath.  None of this, however, was even remotely funny.  The part I laughed at the most was when I was leaving the theater, laughing about how I wasted money and 90 minutes of my life on this movie.  I really thought this movie had the chance to live up to the first one, but it was no where near as funny or as clever as the first, which is still funny. Am I saying that sequels suck?  Absolutely not.  I'm just saying that in cases where the first film is a cult classic like this (and "Friday"), there is no need to ruin the first by making a horrible sequel ("Next Friday")
