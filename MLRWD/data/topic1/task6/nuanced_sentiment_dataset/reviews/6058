Wow! Talk about madness. This movie is one of the wildest ride's you'll ever take. But, don't listen to my hype or anyone elses... discover this movie for yourself. This is a nothing-barred zombie flic that really entertains. Some say it's too long, and while I must agree it can begin to feel repetitive, its so much fun you just don't want it to end!

The story here is surprisingly good (only because it's actually existant: there is a real mythology in Kitamura's world, and a pretty complex on at that), though the performances are as wooden as one should expect from the genre. But that aspect adds only to the wonderful dark humor present throughout the spewing blood, relentless zombies, and unlimited ammo. Not for the weak of stomache or heart, Versus will please just about anyone looking for a light-hearted, gore-heavy, relentlessly fun movie.

Media Blasters has gone all out on this Special Edition -- the transfer is almost on par with the Japanese disc and superior to any othe releases and an extra bonus chock-full of special features (the first disc contains multiple greatly entertaining audio commentaries). For a low-budget cult film, this is a mega-release!

Don't miss this great package of one of the world's best B-movies!
