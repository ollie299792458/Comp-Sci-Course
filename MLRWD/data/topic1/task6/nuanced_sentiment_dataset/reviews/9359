When the book/movie were produced, about 40 years ago, the sexual revolution was new; thus the "God is dead" mentality and the "anything goes" sexual morality exhibited by the story's heroes would have seemed avant-garde. Of course, now such ideas have become mainstream--perhaps even quaint--even though the abandonment of God and the normalization of non-marital sex has hardly resulted in human flourishment.

As I watched the movie, the following passages from the Bible came to mind:

Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger by the way you treat them. (Ephesians 6:4a)

The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." (Psalm 14:1)

And he told them a parable, saying, "The land of a rich man produced plentifully,  and he thought to himself, 'What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?'  And he said, 'I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.  And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.'  But God said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?'  So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God."  (Luke 12:16-21)
