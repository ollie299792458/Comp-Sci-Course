I bought a French copy of this movie and was excited to view the scenes on the back cover showing beautiful cinematography and Matrix-like martial arts moves. There was none of this in the movie. Mind you, I went into this movie not knowing a thing of the Crying Freeman anime series. However as a movie, for its own worth, Crying Freeman is not particularly good. While the story is concrete, and follows through, it somehow feels disjointed and uneventful. To note, there is also a definite mid-90's feel of this movie, which makes it feel dated.  As for the actors, while the characters have the potential for great development (that is to say the whole Crying Freeman story is no doubt intriguing), I believe they are never fully realized.  The only thing of particular interest for me was a great title credit scene with a tattoo on the Crying Freeman coming alive. I was also happy to see a movie take place in the bright and airy San Fransisco.  For those language buffs, English and Japanese are spoken. And I do recall a Chinese language being spoken, though I may be mistaken.
