I loved this movie, in fact I am watching it now. Brendan Fraser, Paul Bettany, Helen Mirren, Jim Broadbent and the actors are great and the story line is pretty good. The scenry is beautiful and makes you want to see the many places in person. Only seen a few bluppers in the movie. Movie shows how people want to be with the ones they love and how families are important. When you can't be with them and there is a chance to, you take it any way you can, even if it takes nine years to finally be together. You never give up. Mo's daughter looks up to him and tries to protect him and sometimes she becomes like a parent to Mo. Dustfinger is a man trying to get back to his family after nine years and seems to be a good, clean, decent man, who is just and tries to help Mo and his daughter get Resa back. Love the way he handles the fire with his hands. The thief is cute & funny, pretty good actor. Lot of good actors especially Andy who played in Lord Of The Rings. The aunt is pretty good too and is very out-spoken, which at times is funny. Looking for a copy of the book to bring back Mo's wife and send Dustfinger home is a journey in itself.  I would give this movie an eight on a scale of one to ten. Mo's daughter sings the ending song and has a great voice.
