I've never seen the original BBC series by Dennis Potter, which I think helps me to see this version in a more objective light. My understanding is that this is not just a "shortened" version of the BBC series but rather a complete reworking by Potter himself (based on the script he wrote) which does in fact happen to be shorter in length. It seems the action has been moved--again, by Potter himself--from England in the 1940's to America in the 1950's, with songs appropriate to that time and place used to explore the motivations of the characters. Having listened to the director's commentary, it seems as though the director of this version was very concerned about staying faithful to Potter's words and intentions.

That said, I think the film can be enjoyed even by those who know nothing about its background. Yes, it's a little offbeat--a dark comedy in which the past and the present, as well as fictional worlds, collide in the mind of one physically and emotionally sick man, complete with stylized musical numbers that may seem to come from nowhere. But I thought it was quite good once I got into its spirit--funny, sad, surprising, moving, and ultimately upbeat without ever feeling forced, manipulative, or weird merely for the sake of being weird. I thought all the actors were excellent; Robert Downey Jr. as the vitriolic writer at the center of the action and Mel Gibson as the awkward therapist who tries to help him stand out especially.

I wrote this review to give people a different perspective from the single previous review, in which this version was compared to the original BBC series and came out the worse. I feel that this version is not simply a "remake" or an "update"--implying it's a cheap knock-off made to squeeze more money out of the franchise--but rather a new examination of the story by the same author in a different time and place. I think people who give it a chance without constantly comparing it to the older version will be pleasantly surprised.
