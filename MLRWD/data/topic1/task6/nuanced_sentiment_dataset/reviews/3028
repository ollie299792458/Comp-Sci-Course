First I wish to state clearly that the movie is fantastic; really first rate. I gave it 1 star for 2 reasons: to get curious readers to heed my warning and to show my disapointment with the editors who put in the  subtitles. Whenever possible I get movies with subtitles. I saw this movie  in Japan when it first came out and had to try to read the subtitles in  Japanese. I understood about 30-40% of it and was really looking forward to  seeing it with English subtitles...I understood more when I saw it in  Japan. Even though the movie is in wide screen format and there is plenty  of screen real estate to fit the subtitles in the black border below the  screen, (the subtitles are in both Mandarin and English) they saw fit to  put them on the screen. If they had put them in the black border the white  subtitles would have been perfectly legible even though they squeezed two  languages in. As it is more than 50% is totally unreadable even if you  pause it every few seconds. The backgrounds are often totally white and  provide no contrast for the subtitles. I do not like dubbed movies but  would suggest to anyone that is thinking of getting this movie to get a  dubbed version.  It is a fantastic movie and well worth seeing, perhaps one  of his 4 or 5 best.
