This is a curious little movie from the director of the X-Files movie (Rob Bowman).  Is it Roadwarrior?  Is it Dragonslayer?  Is it Aliens?  Is it Godzilla?  The answer is that Reign of Fire is a mishmash of elements from all of those movies along with a slew of other sci fi and fantasy clich&eacute;s.  But Bowman manages to make this patchwork premise work.
The movie begins in present day London when miners uncover a race of dragons who have been sleeping for centuries underground.  Jump to twenty years later when the dragons have all but wiped out the human race.  The focus is on fire chief Quinn (Christian Bales) and the band of survivors under his care living in an old castle.  They try to live quietly and out of sight of the dragons, but when the dragons attack, the firemen go to work.  Enter the American Marine Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey) and his troops.  They plan to take the fight back to the dragons and look for assistance from Quinn?s people.  This messes up the relatively quiet life these people have been living and explodes into an all out war with the dragons.
Reign of Fire is a strange mixture of Medieval fantasy and sci fi that works more often than it does not.  The story does not make too many attempts to heavily engage the brain, but it is good popcorn fare.  There are plenty of lapses in logic, but the action moves along quick enough that you do not have time to think about things like that.  The special effects are high caliber and the main characters are strong enough that they do not take a backseat to the visuals.  Overall, it is worth a look when you are in the mood for some entertainment that will not tax your brain too heavily.
The DVD contains a few extras including a mildly interesting documentary on the making of the film.
