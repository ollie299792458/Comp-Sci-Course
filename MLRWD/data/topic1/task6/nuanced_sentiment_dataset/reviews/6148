Ms Streep's performance was fine
But for me the whole concept of this movie was simply insane. I found it extremely confusing to be constantly whipsawing back and forth in time, in & out of reality & hallucinations.
I did find about 5 or 6 brief moments in the film that were VERY good.

HOWEVER, this was not a portrait of Ms Thatcher that I expected, and I'm guessing that it is more or less accurate.
. . IF THAT IS THE CASE, then the film did us a service.
BTW- I loved the King's Speech, The Queen, (I'm not a Brit), there was a PBS/BBC thing about 2 years back about one of the royal kids who had down syndrome or something that was great too.

FOR MUCH BETTER, ABOUT MS THATCHER:
START WITH
Documentary- Margaret Thatcher - Long Walk to Finchley (BBC) - UTube (90min)
This is about young Ms Thatcher up to the point of getting elected to Parliament, at that time she was the first and only female. This was a long, difficult ordeal for her with MANY defeats, in a Brit-version of the Good-ole-boys club.

NEXT GOTO the Documentary-style:
Documentary- Margaret Thatcher - Downing Street Years - also on UTube (4hours)
This series shows pretty clearly why she is a Conservative's Dream Politician
She had utter, and unshakable confidence and belief in herself, and like Reagan, GWB, Cheney, didn't believe in ever questioning her assumptions.
AND her only interest was in being effectively a dictator.
NOTE= In Britain, the PM isn't elected directly by the voters. The PM is elected by ruling party in Parliament, so that you never have a situation which is common in America of Divided-Government.

Hope this helps
