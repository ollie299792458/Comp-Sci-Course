Fantastic Planet remains one of my all-time sci-fi favorites. This movie shows all that was great in the world of sci-fi in the pre-Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind era known as 1973. This odd French/Czech film is stuffed with truly bizarre and psychedelic scenes, with a great '70s funky score. The movie was based on a book from French sci-fi author Stefan Wul called Oms en S&eacute;rie from 1957 (unfortunately the book was never published in English, as far as I know, which is too bad). Anyway, if you still collect VHS, the ultimate version is the Collector's Edition on Anchor Bay with clamshell packaging, in its original French language, with English subtitles. I have to admit the original French voices are quite superior to the American voices of the dubbed-in-English version. Also you get the Fantastic Planet trailer, which has endorsements from everything from the Los Angeles Times to Seventeen Magazine (which seems a bit odd, given the magazine at the time was more for the Brady Bunch, Patridge Family, and the Osmonds type of teen audience). And the trailer also mentioned the awards the film received (especially the Grand Prix award at the infamous Cannes Film Festival in France). And then there are three shorts included, Les Dents du Singe (Monkey's Teeth) (1960), Les Temps Morts (Dead Times) (1964) and Les Escargot (The Snails) (1965). These were the only animateds Ren&eacute; Laloux had done prior to Fantastic Planet. I would only give the three animateds a three star rating, they are fascinating to watch, and you get to see the evolution of the animation that lead up to Fantastic Planet, but they simply pale in comparison to Fantastic Planet itself. But regardless, the subtitled VHS version on Anchor Bay is a total must, and if you like bizarre and unusual sci-fi, get this.
