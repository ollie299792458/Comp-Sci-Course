assuming your already a fan of the show, you know that the series is one of the best. the boxed set holds all the seasons in a relatively easy accessible package. the shows themselves are remastered, and the difference is noticeable to these eyes. the special features are not enough to warrant buying this boxed set, they are short and only slightly revealing. the box itself is very attractive and durable, with only a small problem with unweildlyness. recommended to fans of the show that must have everything. if you previously own the seasons as they came out i cant recommend it for the remastering, or special features alone.

As per complaints about the dvd's being scratched. a few of mine did get scratched on the taking in and out of the cases, this did not affect quality or performance of the dvd's, but it will surely happen over time. i am aware some people are obsessive over their dvd's and like to keep them flawless like a rare gem, but meh faint scratches dont bother me that much.
