Most of my positive feelings for this movie come from watching it as a teenager on Saturday sci-fi theather. Clearly made on the downside of Heston's career, this film is so preachy (about the horrors of man's science run amok, racism, crass materialism, etc.) it almost makes you want to change the channel. The science and politics of the movie are to real science and politics what Kenny G is to real jazz - close but not quite there. Of course, Heston plays it up with a psuedo-seriousness that would give Vincent Price or William Shatner a run for their money. If you want to see a Heston in a better apocolyptic thriller, Soylent Green is a better bet and in the Omega Man he comes no where close to his performance in Planet of the Apes. 
All this being said, The Omega Man is a fun, juvenile romp. The delivery of all the gloom and doom speeches is just campy enough to keep you from taking the movie too seriously. Despite the overpreening preachiness of the movie, The Omega Man has some serious upsides:
The scenes of Heston running through a empty LA are particularly creepy and Heston watching the movie Woodstock is a great definition of irony (somehow I don't think the NRA screens it too often). The running battles between Heston and the "vampires" of LA are amusing as is the whole 'last man on Earth' motif of the film. And for a B movie, the production values are pretty good (you have to remember this was the 1970's).
