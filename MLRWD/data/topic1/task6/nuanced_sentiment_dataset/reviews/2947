I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this through Amazon Vine. For one thing, I thought it was for adults. Five minutes into it I thought maybe it was for children after all. I will be the lone reviewer to say I didn't like it. I thought Watanuki was much too silly and he annoyed me. I watch cartoons and children's movies with my seven year old grandson all the time so it's not like I'm not acquainted with them. In fact, I am a big fan of Speed Racer and both Superman and Batman, the Animated Series. Watanuki whined and threw tantrums every few minutes. After a while I found myself fast forwarding through his outbursts. His behavior ruined any enjoyment I might have otherwise gotten from the DVD. I was very surprised when I finished writing this review and went to the product page to find it was rated PG14. It seemed too silly for that age group. In fact, I don't know where I would place it. I do know I would have been very upset if I had paid for this movie.

The animation was very well done. It's just too bad Watanuki's character wasn't better drawn. The animation alone earned 2 stars from me.
