This movie is far from "..a must see" and far, far from deserving 5 stars that some people gave it. I'm a fan of slow movies, but in those cases, it's usually the characters that drive the movie.  trust_ is a disturbing crime drama that goes nowhere.  You'll end up hating the pervert so much only to be let down in the end.  Clive Owen saves the movie with some great acting.  But it isn't enough.  I applaud David Schwimmer for pushing people's expectations, but its impossible to expect anyone to like it.  Is this some cautionary tale about the Internet?  Who knows, but it sucked bad.

The movie in less than 30 seconds:  teenager is raped by sicko pervert guy, but still thinks he 'loves her'. Clive Owen is hell-bent on revenge (which would've been a hell of a better movie, but his revenge is unfulfilled) and his attitude causes family problems.  The girl finally is 'un-brainwashed' when she finds out the sicko has done it 3 other times with 3 underage girls.  Dad and girl make up, the end.

WTF-ending?  Did they catch the guy?  Nope.  Did they come close?  Not really.  I just lost 2 hrs of my life.

5 stars folks?  Godfather = 5 stars, Apocalypse Now = 5 stars, Rocky = 5 stars.  This movie?  I hated it so much that I'm writing this review of how bad it sucked and how much I hated it.
