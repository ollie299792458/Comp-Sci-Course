Some time back, I heard some good things about this from someone I know. Remind me never to trust his opinion again! Some of the comments I've read on other reviews are spot on the mark. Massive amounts of slo-mo violence for little reason other than - oh yes, it's about knights and war, so it must have to be violent! Wait a minute. Isn't a film supposed to have a decent storyline? Not this one, clearly.

Don't get me wrong. I love the premise of a film set in the early 13th century; one with knights, great big battles, 'bad' King John and the Magna Carta; barons who want to rein in his cruel rule. It's got all the hallmarks of a great film. Throw in James Purefoy, so good in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028RXXE8">Rome</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0091P6RAM">Solomon Kane</a>, and Paul Giamatti, the star of the wonderful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I9YWWU">Sideways</a> and you've got a surefire winner - one would have thought.

Instead, we have a risible King John, fighting with an American accent the whole way through the film. That's when he's not throwing temper tantrums in a high pitched voice redolent of Walt Disney's Robin Hood, or stamping his foot like a toddler. The main female actress spends her time swooning over Purefoy, finding plenty of locations in a tiny castle to be alone with him. The mercenaries employed by King John are 'Danes' - Viking rip offs of the cartoon variety. And then we get to the fact that there are only seven men defending a castle against more than a thousand. Seven - like the Magnificent Seven - except this lot are really mediocre. Yet still they manage to hold out for many months. I know that one has to suspend disbelief in films, but not to this extent - and that's just one example.

Don't get me started on the history either. The stories of the time are amazing, and need little changing to make a great film. Why use fictitious Danes? Why pretend that so few men can defend a castle when in fact it was taken by King John? Why make out that after his death that things went back to the way they were, when in fact his son took the throne?

What a shame I wasted my money on this bilge. Avoid.
