A stalwart actor like Ben Kingsley is truly wasted in this movie.

Sir Ben Kingsley plays the role of a Benjamin O'Ryan, a clairvoyant undercover out-of-service FBI agent who is following a serial killer across the country. En route, Benjamin uncovers other serial killers using clairvoyance and murders them. Sursprisingly, Benjamin leaves a signature (a zero with a stroke) after every murder. This trait confuses the in-service FBI agents Mackelway (Aaron Eckhart) & his partner (Carrie-Anne Moss) to believe that Benjamin is the actual killer on the prowl. The story meanders along slowly and Mackelway eventually (after getting lots of confusing hints from Benjamin) figures out Benjamin is actually leading them to the killer. Visuals of Benjamin getting clairvoyance are dark and disturbing. The graphic images just add to the darkness.

All in all a boring fare that will give you a bad taste.

I think actors like Ben Kingsley and Carrie-Anne Moss have been wasted in this movie.
