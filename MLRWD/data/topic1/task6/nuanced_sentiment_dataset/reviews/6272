What prompted me to purchase Hairspray 1988 is recently seeing Hairspray 2007 in the movie theatre.  It was so great that I saw it 5 times.  Then I was curious about the original 1988 Hairspray.  My daughter was crazy about it back then but I never saw it.  It has Ricki Lake as the plump girl trying to get to be a regular on the Corny Collins Show, an after school teenage dance program.  Ricki Lake makes a cameo appearance in the 2007 version but has no spoken words; she's just observing a dance competition from the audience.  Jerry Stiller is in both movies, playing the part of Mr. Pinky in the 2007 version.  It is so much fun to compare the two movies, both the 1988 and the 2007.  They are both based on the same subjects, integration on The Corny Collins Show.  The character names are the same but played by different people.  Both versions have terrific sound tracks, but different.  I never would have bought Hairspray 1988 if it hadn't been for the re-make.  The 1988 movie is WONDERFUL and so is the 2007 version.  It was so much fun to see it over and over and compare them.  I just adore this nostalgic movie and suggest to everyone to definitely buy it and buy the 2007 one too when it is released on DVD.  I certainly will.
