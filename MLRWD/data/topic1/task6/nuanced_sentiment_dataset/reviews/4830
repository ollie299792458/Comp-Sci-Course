It's subtitled, and if you watch, you should be sure to select English SDH, because knowing which language is being actually spoken and translated to subtitle is an aspect of the plot and provides nuances in the dialogue.

I don't know if more should be revealed than is found on the jacket, but the story is a genre of organized crime and gangs, with hints into possible terrorist-funding sources, but it is not presented in the usual way at all, particularly in how the film explores the apparition of conscience and guilt.  It is very strong on character, with Tahar Rahim giving a thoughtful and subtly expressive performance in his first motion-picture role, his portrayal, with ephemeral shades of Antonio Banderas, building slowly, along with the film's plot, to show a complete evolution of status and power in the principal characters, and undoubtedly marking for Rahim the beginning of a fruitful career.
