This flick (to me) was nothing more than a high-tech re-hash of the 1933 classic Invisible Man that starred Claude Rains and Gloria (Titanic) Stuart. Brilliant scientist finds secret of invisibility, becomes a no-see-um, becomes a murderous madman, and dies at the end. What saved this movie from a one-star rating in my book was the incredible special effects. Unfortunately, Paul Verhoeven has again used flashy SF to cover a very weak plot(Starship Troopers). The characters are nothing to write home about, and after the first 15 minutes, you can pretty much tell who will live and who won't. Liz Shue and Josh Brolin turned out fairly wooden performances, veering between romance and action in a rather clumsy fashion. Kevin Bacon reeked of "bad dude" from the get-go, but it seemed that his rampages started too soon, and for a very weak reason. The supporting cast was actually better than the main stars, and you actually felt sorry when they were offed by Bacon in a series of (very painful) methods. But, I must say, the most entertaining feature was when Bacon first became invisible. I think we all have wondered how much fun it would be, although most people would not revert to rape and murder to get their jollies. But, if you want a movie with wonderful SF, laughable characters and predictable plot twists, check this out. It is a good way to spend a wintered-in evening.
