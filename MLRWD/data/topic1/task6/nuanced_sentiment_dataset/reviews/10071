The book "Big Trouble" was Dave Barry's first novel and was his first effort into 'full length' literature.  Of course, Dave Barry had already been writing for several years before he penned "Big Trouble" but most of his works up to that time had been ten-minute stories for the Miami Herald.  Even his many books were little more than compilations of his weekly newspaper pieces.  But "Big Trouble" was different.  It had a story to tell.  It was a funny story (how could Dave Barry do anything else?) and I enjoyed it tremendously!

But now, "Big Trouble" has been made into a movie and like all other movies-from-books, I expected "Big Trouble", the movie, to have very little in common with "Big Trouble", the book.  But I was pleasently surprised because the movie followed the book very closely!  Everything that I thought was funny in the book was repeated, mostly word-for-word, in the movie.  The producer and director aparrently didn't feel that they could improve on Dave Barry's writing style and the video audience is so much the better for it.  (Now if we could only convince other movie producers to follow the original books more faithfully...)

Anyway, my wife and I (both big Dave Barry fans) watched the movie on a quiet evening during the Christmas holidays and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  We didn't expect the movie to be a statement on any current politics (the Iraq War, The Bush Administration, Britney Spears nekkid internet pictures, etc) nor did we expect the movie to solve any of mankind's problems (world hungar, disease, Britney Spears, etc.)  What we got was what we expected - silly, corny humor and a good reason to sit on the couch and wolf down a bucket of popcorn.  If it's something important and meaningful that you crave, forget this video.  Watch a Britney Spears video instead.
