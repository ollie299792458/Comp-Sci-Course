I'm a holiday movie addict. I love anything set to Christmas time. Well almost anything.

What I don't care for are movies that rely on time-tested story material with only minor changes based on family ethnicity and general dynamics.

I'm a realist; many American holiday tales look the same from family to family regardless of cultural heritage. Having been raised in several ethnically diverse households, the biggest differences lie in what we eat, when we go to church, and some activities the family does when they get together.

But the basic plot and players are the same.

Nothing Like the Holidays was enjoyable for its acting primarily. I got a few good laughs out of it.

Beyond this, I felt there were too many sub-stories going on that were only held together loosely by the meta-story. Further, I often found myself thinking "Oh, I've seen this character's story in __________".

Overall, this is a serviceable holiday film enhanced by Puerto Rican aspects. I wondered if this would be more enjoyable to Puerto Ricans (particularly in the Chicago area) or if they'd think it was too flat as well.

I give it three stars because it's a relatively cute albeit mindless holiday dramedy. And I love almost all holiday movies.
