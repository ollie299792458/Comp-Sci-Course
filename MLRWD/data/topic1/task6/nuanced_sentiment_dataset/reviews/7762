I LOVE this movie, it is warm, funny, and only the least bit irreverent... but I HATE the DVD. Why?
You are FORCED to view about 10 minutes of "previews". That's right folks, not only do you get to read the FBI warning, but you also get nearly 10 minutes of UNINTERRUPTIBLE previews! Stop won't work, select another chapter is prohibitted - at least on my recent vintage progressive scan Panasonic DVD player.
Someone needs to be taken out the the woodshed!
Note without this annoying feature, the movie would get 5 stars from me. With the unwelcome previews... well, you can pop the corn, teach your dog to flush the toilet, and brew a pot of coffee before you'll be able to start watching what you actually paid for!
BONUS FEATURES!
Of interest are the "bonus features" including scads of deleted scenes and outtakes. For example, there is one scene (shown on TV ads) where the conniving news anchor can't seem to say anything intelligible. It is side splitting funny! Fortunately what is left in the movie is *tastefully* mean. The alternative you find in the deleted scenes involves nasty bodily mayhem to the poor S.O.B. The treatment is so mean spirited it makes Bruce's character disgusting, not amusing.
In this case, I give two thumbs up to the editors for choosing the high road. Some other scenes are similarly justly removed. And a few even give you some insights into things that might not otherwise make sense. If you've seen the movie you may recall a big party scene in a large mansion. One of the coffee tables is covered about a foot deep in shrimp. In the deleted scenes, you learn why!
Yeah, the editors did a good job - but the numbnuts who wrote the DVD script... they deserve massive nosebleeds and flaming hairdos.
