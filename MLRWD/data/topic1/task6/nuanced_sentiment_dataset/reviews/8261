While "There's Something About Mary" had a lot of laughs there were a lot of moments when I questioned whether it was necessary to overstep the bounds. In scenes like the "zipper scene" when Stiller got his "private parts" caught in the zipper did they  actually have to show it? I got the point after the thousandth time the  father, the mother, the cop, and the firefighter showed their bewilderment  at how Stiller got the zipper all the way up.(Don't show [it] please)  I was bewildered at how the "release the tension" scene was  filmed. I didn't think it was funny to see Stiller's facial expressions  while he was making "fire-by-friction" in the bathroom.(Less is  More Sometimes! ) The "hair gel" on the ear was just filthy.(Aye  Carumbe! ) The ending was anti-climactic to say the least as it ends like  everyone should expect as Stiller got the girl. There was nothing  interesting about how he got Mary.(At the end anyway) A decision is not  enough to get a laugh out of me. Sometimes more is  better! (Imagination)The whole scene when Stiller got arrested did not  get a chuckle out of me.(Homosexual jokes are examples of lowest common  denominator comedy. They are hackneyed and lack imagination.) The  shenannigans of the three men(actually four) were indeed hillarious and the  potential was certainly there for an explosion of hillarity in a romantic  setting but despite a great performance from Matt Dillon as the  pathetically sleazy private eye(with shiny white teeth) and the great  performance by the guy who played the pizza delivery boy/architect this  movie still didn't deliver. Decent performances from Ben Stiller and  Cameron Diaz didn't score a touchdown with me either.(Chris Elliot couldn't  save it) "There's Something About Mary" is somewhat of a dud.  There was a great plan for this movie but poor execution and that  translates to an average comedy and an average movie. There's too much  slapstick and not enough cerebral comedy. Brett Favre?
