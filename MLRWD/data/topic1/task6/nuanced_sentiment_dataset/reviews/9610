Trying to understand the popularity of The Wedding Singer I've got to assume many never tire of its sappy, done-once-too-many-times formula plot of two people meant for each other about to marry the wrong people. Will they end up happily ever after? What do you think? Harlequin, the romance novel franchise and happy ending specialists, should sue the producers for plagiarism.

There are a few rare moments of fun in a movie that, overall, is quite uninspired, too often dull, and as predictable as the characters are unsurprising cardboard cutouts. Headliners Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler frequently make moon eyes at each other but that doesn't equate to chemistry, forget acting. The highlight in this movie is granny getting down to boogey.  Unfortunately, that scene lasts maybe 10 seconds. Plus, it was played to death in the trailers.

Adam Sandler allegedly falls apart when his fiance doesn't show up at the wedding. But his grossly exaggerated self-pitty routine is neither believable nor particularly funny. Rarely does his voice veer from a droning monotone. You know you're a bad actor when Billy Idol's acting steals a scene from you during a cameo! His funniest moment is his unintentional bad lip syncing during his final tear-jerking silly love song. The good news is at least Drew Barrymore can act which, in this flick, is a very lonely job.

If you yearn for '80s pop tunes, the sound track is the best part of the Wedding Singer and, to large extent, helps the audience pass the time. Too bad so much of the music is just short clips.

The happy ending with The Wedding Singer is that it eventually does end.
