A movie I'd never even heard of until seeing it last year, this Australian flick immediately became a favorite of mine.  Perhaps it's the depressing old school clan who pick on Muriel that reminded me of similar occurrences.

The movie depicts the Australian woman, Muriel, (Toni Collette) as a rather blah overweight women, stuck in the 80's, piddling behind the last of the popular school girls who quickly kick her out of the the group.  Depressed, she more or less swindles money from her family and follows the girls to a vacation island, only to bump into an old high school girl, Rhonda (Rachel Griffits) who recognizes her.  The two quickly become friends, after Rhonda completely tears the girls to shreds in one of the best verbal reads (cut downs) ever spoken.  It's the most hilarious part of the movie.

The two girls become room mates, and their friendship grows...so does the fun, the antics, and even the seriousness and sadness of reality.  It's the reality of this movie that makes it so embracing.  Frankly, the fresh cast, as opposed to the typical movies with the same old faces, make this movie what it is.  There is not a weak performance from anyone, and there's a rather large cast, keeping everything fresh.
