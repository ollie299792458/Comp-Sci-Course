In another excellent role from Robert DeNiro, "Meet the Parents" is one of the best comedies of 2000. In yet another hilarious role, Ben Stiller (as "Greg Focker") plays a male nurse who spends the weekend with his future in-laws and causes havoc when he tries to please his girlfriend's father-in-law (DeNiro), who is more than who he appears to be. 
Directed by Jay Roach, who directed the Austin Powers movies, "Meet the Parents" guarantees some great laughs as Stiller tries his hardest to gain the approval of DeNiro, who just wants the best for his daughter. The jokes and gags are quite better than the Farelly brothers' gross-out toilet humor, mostly because of DeNiro's great performance, which rivals his other recent comedic role in "Analyze This", which I also recommend if you want to see the other side of DeNiro. The only reason I gave this movie 4 instead of 5 stars is because Stiller makes so many mistakes in trying to impress DeNiro that it almost seems unreal. But otherwise, a solid buy with a good mix of romance and comedy!
