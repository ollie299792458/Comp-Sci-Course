If you loved the originally cut movie Payback, you will probably not like the Director's Cut, because about half of the original film has been cut. If that is what "director's cut" means, then I must have missed something because I liked the original film. I'm sorry if I'm not "sophisticated" enough for this director, but the whole ending is gone. I really enjoyed the original ending where he gets PAYBACK. You know, like the name of the movie? Where's the payback in the new Director's Cut? There is none. Well, there's half of it anyway. Where is Chris Christofferson and the scene with kidnapping his son and all that? Where is the scene where Gibson leaves a bomb in the hotel room for the bad guys? Where is the scene where he climbs under the car and wires it up? Man, that's all gone. This is like Braveheart without the "FREEDOM!" scene, just William Wallace walking back to Scotland. It's like Lethal Weapon without Danny Glover. It's like Apocalypto without human sacrifice. It's like We Were Soldiers without getting deployed to Vietnam. It's like Star Wars without Darth Vader. FAIL!

So, where's the original edition? Too screwed up for this director's taste? Why not include both editions on the blue-ray? It was too offensive? Look, dude, that was the movie, like it or not. You don't go and axe 50% of a film, put YOUR ideas back in. The film is the film, whether you liked the end result or not. There's a reason why the studios passed on your cut--grandiose FAIL.

Original: 5 stars
Remake: 2 stars

Don't even bother with the director's cut. Doesn't matter what reasons they give. It's not the same film. It's like some weird sequel or prequel or something!
