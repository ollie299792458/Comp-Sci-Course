Akira the animated film is a different animal from it's original comic book/graphic novel series. The printed series is far superior to this animated one and if you just plop in the DVD you're more than likely going to be confused as to what's happening in the end. Tetsuo's power is so overwhelming that he cannot control it thus it manifests itself in the grotesque flesh mutation we see at the end of the movie. In the books this happens over a long period of time so we know exactly what is happening to him. Akira himself appears in the book series as a little boy but in the film we see him in parts contained in jars of liquid. When you know the difference between what we read and what we see in this film then can we only appreciate what Akira is really about.

I would not recommend this DVD to anyone unless you have read through the paper series and can understand what the whole story is about. If you're just a technical junkie then the animation prowess Otomo presents in this film may be enough to get you to like it.

Overall the series is an absolute must read and the film itself is good but is rather condensed which is what is confusing a lot of the reviewers I have read through.
