The movie itself isn't that bad.  It's what i expected, which wasn't much.  I'm not a big fan of horror films since they almost never scare me or even give me the type of thrill that a horror movie should.  So this was typical in that regard.

Obviously the premise is a stretch, but that's the fun of movies.  She is blind and gets a cornea transplant to restore her vision, but the donor of the cornea's could "see dead people".

Ahem.

That's fine for make-believe stories and entertainment, but the DVD has a featurette with "experts" (can you really be an expert in make-believe?) talking about how "everybody is psychic" and "phenotype to genotype information transfer is possible."
The last quote is from somebody with "doctor" in their title.  An actual doctor said that. doubleyou-tee-eff?  That whole featurette is nonsense and pseudoscience.  It was incredibly irresponsible to produce that and include it on a dvd that will end up in the hands of people that aren't even going to look up anything about genetics and see that phenotype-to-genotype transfer is impossible.

Lion's Gate should be ashamed.
