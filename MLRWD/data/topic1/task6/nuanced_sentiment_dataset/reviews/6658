I like Forest, and that's the best thing about the film, not his performance, but just the fact that he was in it. I personally thought they could have picked a better candidate to play Idi Amin. There are many great African actors in Uganda, Nigeria and Ghana who could have played the part well and given it more authenticity. But commercialization...the film was fairly accurate (Barbara Schroeder's documentary had some loopholes). For a better, raw depiction of Idi Amin watch "The Rise and Fall of Idi Amin" (1981). Ugandan actor Joseph Olita gave a hardcore portrayal of the dictator, and while some of the acts were debatable (e.g was he really a cannibal), the film has some actual people who interacted with Amin in it (e.g. UK reporter Denis Hills who was sentenced to death by Amin then released),gives more background with the Israeli/American/Libyan involvement and is/was not commercialized for American viewers. Last King of Scotland is an entertaining film, but I did not feel they gave an accurate portrayal of the ruthless Idi Amin. He was a bit soft in this film.
