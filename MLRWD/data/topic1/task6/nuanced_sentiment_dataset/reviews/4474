Is it possible for a sequel to be better than the original?  Absolutely... when the original is a low-budget piece of fundamentalist Christian propaganda trash with no redeeming qualities other than unintentional humor.  With this movie, the acting is better, the cinematography is better, the story is more interesting, some of the characters are actually interesting, and it doesn't seem to be cobbled together from cheap stock footage.

So, it's better than the first movie.  Does that mean it's good? No. It's mediocre, which is still a step up.

The acting is still hammy, with the villain being portrayed with what is perhaps the worst case of overacting in the history of movies.  Some of the characters are interesting... some aren't.  Most of all, it has the typical preachy, smug Christian fundamentalist attitude, which it carries without shame.  The atheist is the typical straw-man of an atheist: one who disbelieves based on some tragic event and refuses to "open his heart", rather than one who has surveyed the arguments for God's existence and found them lacking.  For shame... if more Christians would only make a meager attempt to understand those with whom they disagree, it would certainly make for some more rational discussion.
