When I watched The Pillow Book I happened to stumble onto it at about 3 am on television.  I had never heard of it, but was immediately lured in by the promise of Ewan McGregor.  Two hours later, I sat staring in a sort of shocked stupor at the darkened screen.  Never before have I seen a film that picks you up so completely and holds you in its thrall.  My mind was whirling and spinning and trying to absorb everything I had just seen.  Thus, I gave the film four stars.  It was brilliant, it was witty, it was wild, it was a sensual trip into a world whose existance I had never contemplated.  Having gushed about how much I loved the movie I feel compelled to warn the movie- goer that this is not a casual film to watched lightheartedly.  You really have to be alert and willing to direct your full attention to the film or you will be lost from start to finish.  When The Pillow Book moves, it moves, but when it doesn't don't dwell on it.  Just use the time to catch your breath, trust me you'll need the breather to avoid a total system overload...
