It's taken me a while to review "Under Siege", even though it's one of the first Steven Seagal movies I saw. The delay was necessary because I wanted to give it a fair chance: when I first saw the film, I was aware that it was Seagal's most famous picture but I didn't really like it too much. Nevertheless, I was determined to realize why it received the acclaim it did, and I think I've guessed the reason: it was big simply because it was Seagal's first big movie. That sounds kind of redundant, but by the standards of his previous flicks, this one's huge. Battleships, submarines, fighter jets, helicopters, nuclear weapons, and explosions galore had no place his previous films but are commonplace in this one, and I think this helped legitimize Seagal as an action hero for hitherto closeted fans who thought they were above his guilty-pleasure B-movies. Therein, however, lies the movie's weakness. Make no mistake, "Under Siege" is a great action film for the casual viewer, but for those of us reared on the no-nonsense carnage of Seagal's trademark features, this impersonal, special effects-powered Hollywood machine represents a step down the ladder.

The story: Casey Ryback (Seagal) is a lethal cook of the USS Missouri who's won the favor of the crew but the contempt of the unstable Commander Krill (Gary Busey, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790729695">Lethal Weapon</a>). When a surprise party for the ship's captain is revealed as a raid to take over the ship by an ex-CIA mercenary (Tommy Lee Jones, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00177YA1K">Men in Black</a>) in cahoots with Krill, Ryback must utilize all his skills to stop a nuclear attack on America.

Yes, it's a movie in the mold of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SRC">Die Hard</a>, but as far as rip-offs go, this one's pretty good. There's certainly enough action in the form of explosions (as small as microwave bombs and as large as submarines going up in flames), gunfights, and the various slicing and dicing of human body parts by the knife-savvy Ryback. Seagal seems quite at ease in the role of a human bulldozer: never before had a character of his been quite as invincible as Casey Ryback, whose hand-to-hand lethalness stretches to being able to tear a man's throat out of his neck with his bare hand. Not only that, but his resourcefulness could give MacGyver a run for his money: cocktail bombs are a given, but after seeing him defuse a nuclear warhead with only a potful of boiling water, you really begin to wonder where the man's limits are. That's where the film's faults start, really. Seagal's characters have always had a tendency to be empowered, but Ryback's level of omnipotence is enough to take the tension out of any situation. By the time the movie is halfway over, you know that nothing and nobody on the ship is going to stop him. While Seagal and director Andrew Davis (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ATZT">The Fugitive</a>) have a knack of delivering satisfying comeuppances against their bad guys, (SPOILER!) it's less fulfilling to see the eventual deaths of Krill and Stranix after it's been made clear that they don't stand a chance in hell to begin with.

Luckily, more charismatic characters also populate this film. Even though it would be another year before Tommy Lee Jones would win his Oscar, his simultaneously comedic and disturbing portrayal of the government agent gone insane is excellent, and making him definitely one of the top villains that Seagal has ever faced. The rest of the acting content is pretty good for an action picture: Busey's trademark gravelly voice has never sounded better, sidekick Erika Eleniak (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J10KKA">Baywatch</a>) stretches her skills to the limit with more-than-passable results, the underrated Patrick O'Neal is honorable as the doomed captain, and even supporting stars Andy Romano, Nick Mancuso, Colm Meaney, and and the rest do well in their roles to show up the theatrically-challenged Seagal, whose overly-arrogant demeanor in this movie makes Ryback one of my least favorite characters he's portrayed.

Still, "Under Siege" has it where it counts, and that's the high-octane brawn that puts it up there with other big-name action vehicles of the time and lesser "Die Hard" sequels. While it's mandatory for any fan of Steven's to keep this explosion-prone opus in their collection, consider your audience carefully when deciding whether to use this film to introduce a friend to Seagal. As for me, I'll watch it a couple times in the year just to keep his other films in perspective, but it'll never top my best-of lists.
