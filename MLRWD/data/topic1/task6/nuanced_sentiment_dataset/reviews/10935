For those of you (like me) that grew up in the 1980's and experienced the horror "boom", this film will bring back pleasant memories of either viewing it at the local drive-in or the town "walk-in" (as we called it in Southern, Oregon).  The worst one can do is compare some of these 80's gems to the films of today.  The special effects in this film were "cutting edge" when it came out and the themes highly relevant.  Post Love Canal, toxic waste was a hot button issue and the enviromentalist movement was hitting its stride.  "The Prophecy" took those issues, combined it with a little extra political strife concerning forest clear cutting and the land rights of Native Americans, and made a pretty decent social, horror film.

Plus 10 Bonus Points for being a classic film that clearly represents the themes of its time.  Great to watch with the kids on All Hallow's Eve.
