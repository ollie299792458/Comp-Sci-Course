I just don't get why critics are falling all over themselves over this movie. It even got selected as one of AFI's all-time top 100 movies.
This movie, as we all know by now, is about this kidnap drama that gets botched up. It's a true story and sad to know that people died unneccessarily. But the movie itself is hardly rivetting.
The movie is really slow and the protagonist ( a pregnant cop ) travels to St. Pauls/Minneapolis and meets up with this chinese acquaintance, which to me seemed totally irrelevant to the movie at all. She was, afterall, supposed to be going there on a lead that she got.
There are some pretty macabre scenes and this movie is definitely not for those who are repulsed by the sight of blood.
But there's not an iota of suspense or thrill as the movie drags along and the suspect(s) were found, not as the result of intelligence, but merely because she (McDormond) happened to chance upon the "stolen" car (used by the thugs) while driving home to her home-town of Brainerd.
And as for the 'humor', I failed to see any humor throughout the length of the movie.
As a true story it indeed is chilling but as a movie, it fails to wake up most audiences from their slumber.
Avoid this movie.
