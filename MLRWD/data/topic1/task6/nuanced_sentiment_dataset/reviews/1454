I'll tell you first that I can guarantee that I am as big an MST3K fan as anyone (I DO have every episode from KTMA to season 10 on tape).  With that said, I just can't get into any of the episodes before season 3.  I can't point out why exactly, other than that I think the jokes just aren't as funny.  I don't know if it is because the best jokes ended up coming from Paul Chaplin and Mary Jo Pehl (who didn't join the team until season 3) or if they just hadn't hit a groove yet, or what.  But it just seems to me that none of the early episodes have the edge and laugh-out-loug humor of the later episodes.  As far as I'm concerned, MST hit its peak with season 4 and continued strong though season 7 (and even season 8).  The episodes from seasons 1 and 2 I just cannot watch anymore.
Anyway, off my soapbox, and onto this episode.  The movie is basically about a guy who works with the cops to bring down a gang that caused his brothers death, and ...uhhh...then other stuff happens... and they have strange orgies of licking and groping.....and then it ends.  Yeah, pretty bad, really.  Not a lot of plot here, to tell you the truth.  And the orgies were pretty lame, too, as far as orgies go.  And the Joel and Bots commentary just wasn't up to snuff with later episodes.  There were some funny moments, but nothing that made me shoot my drink out through my nose or anything.  However, this episode had some classic host segments from episode's past(all cut to in nifty flashback form) and that saved it from the 2 rating that I would have given it.
So, I really didn't like this one all that much, I guess.  Oh well, they got better.
