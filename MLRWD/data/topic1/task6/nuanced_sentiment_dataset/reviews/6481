I AM AN ANIMAL BY INGRID NEWKIRK
WOW WHAT AN ACTIVIST SHE IS..CAN GET A LITTLE OUT OF HAND TO MAKE HER POINT BUT THE POINT IS SHE CARES ABOUT ALL THE ANIMALS SO MUCH..THERE ARE NO LIMITS TO HOW FAR SHE WILL GO..SHE HAS BALLS..SHE HAS GUTS..I ADMIRE HER STRENGTH AND TENACITY.I SUPPORT PETA.AND I AM A VEGETARIAN FOR ABOUT A YEAR..THE MORE EDUCATED I BECOME ON ANIMAL SLAUGHTER FOR FOOD AND FURS AND CLOTHES..IM HORRIFIED OUR SUPPOSEDLY GREAT USA SUPPORTS THIS. THE USA USDA AND FDA AND MOST OF GOVERNMENT IS SO CORRUPT AND MAKE LAWS THAT SATISFY THE PEOPLE ONLY ON PAPER BUT LIKE THE HUMANE SLAUGHTER ACT TO PROTECT ANIMALS IS NOT ENFORCED. A COMPLETE JOKE. LIKE I SAID ON PAPER DO THEY PRETEND THEY CARE. A GREAT VIDEO TO OPEN UP YOUR EYES TO WHAT REALLY GOES ON IN THIS WORLD. WE CAN IMPROVE IT SO MUCH MORE ..IF ONLY WE TRULY CARED. WHAT IF I WAS THAT LIVE COW GETTING HIS THROAT SLIT OR LIVE ANIMAL BEING SKINNED ALIVE, WHAT IF IT WAS ME...THEN HOW WOULD IT BE.THE BEATLES SAID IT BEST.GEORGE HARRISON WITH THE SONG MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS...I LOOK AT THE WORLD AND I KNOW IT NEEDS SWEEPING...STILL MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS..I LOOK AT YOU ALL..SEE THE LOVE THERE THATS SLEEPING,,STILL MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS....I FEEL THE SAME WAY NOW THAT IVE AWAKENED MORE THAN EVER.
