I have seen and reviewed literally thousands of films and not to brag, but I think I know a great movie when I see it and I believe I know a perfect waste of time when I see it. This is a complete waste of time and the most boring movie I ever saw. One person here raves about a boring 6 1/2 minute scene of the hero finding a man asleep in his chair and helps him to bed as being great and shot in one continuous shot with one camera. How can you use any more cameras for such drivel?  I could take a camera and let you watch me wiggle my feet for 10 minutes but I would not try to pass it off as interesting or worthy of anyone to view. Other "memorable" scenes involve 2 people walking with a close up shot for minutes that seemed like hours. Another "breakthrough" scene was equally boring. It showed a big trailer slowly coming into town at about 5 miles an hour, literally, and the "climax" is that the main character of the film is watching it. The only amazing thing about this scene is that anyone watched it and even more incredible that anyone made it.
If this filmmaker ever got money from me to make a film of this magnitude of boredom I would smack him in the head and take away his camera.
Seriously, if you watch this movie, you deserve what you get. I would have given it no stars but I was afraid people would think I forgot to rate it. Words can't describe how boring, awful, amatuerish, and waste of time this movie is. I would love to hear from anyone on this.
