I have to agree with the naysayers on review of this movie:  it is sadly not at all what Mr. Isherwood's book conveyed. I read a discreetly located version of this book in 1966, I believe, and it was a stark read of a man's forelorn stream of conciousness regarding the loss of his lover, and how the world around him is now seemingly diffeent to him by this loss.  This movie is nothing like the book, save a few character's names and the setting in Los Angeles.  This movie is another man's (Mr. Tom Ford) copycat ideas from another man's (Mr. Isherwood) book.  I wondered if Mr. Isherwood were alive to tell, what his reaction might be to such a distasteful gleaming of one man's ideas turned into another man's ideas, with no regard to the orginal piece of work.  Mr. Ford has simply taken a storyline, and rewrote it --with the help of others-- to reflect his own life, as Mr. Ford does indeed state in the movie commentary.  When I first viewed the movie, I thought, 'Which book did Mr. Ford indeed read in order to base this drivel?'  After rewatching it the next evening with the commentary by Mr. Ford, I understood completely how this movie came to pass.  This is the egocentric audacity of Mr. Ford's vanity, upon which he took his own life instances, tossed out the bulk of Mr. Isherwood's story, and made a movie about Mr. Tom Ford: pretentious and lacking substance and story and feeling, to be quite frank.  The movie, on its own merit, is imagery "drivel."
