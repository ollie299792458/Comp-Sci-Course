The first thing you should know about this movie is that it is *extremely* violent. Various scenes include an attack by dobermans, gang style executions, a bare-knuckle brawl and an all out gang war. The most gory scene shows a brief shot of a compound fracture.

That out of the way, it is an interesting and emotionally engaging movie. This is the story of four brothers trying to track down the killers of their adoptive mother. The relationships between the brothers are very well developed, and seeing their growth and conflict adds a great deal to what could otherwise be just a frag-fest. Bobby (played by Mark Wahlberg) is the unofficial leader of the four. His tactics are effective, although none too subtle. On the other side of the coin is Jeremiah, a play-it-straight family man who would mostly like to put the whole thing behind him.

As they carry on their search, each of them learns more about the others. Through their arguments you sense the bonds between them straining and strengthening. At its most serious, the one brother is implicated in the plotting of their mother's murder. Their anger and affection for each other create a strong sense of community.

Other than the violence I mentioned earlier, my only real complaint is that their mother (particularly after her death) is portrayed as ridiculously angelic. It's possible that with better writing (or slightly better acting) I could find this character convincing, but as it is, she falls terribly flat.
