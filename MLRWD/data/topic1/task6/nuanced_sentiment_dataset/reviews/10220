I adored this film.  It was realistic without being overly sappy and simplistic.  And I do worry about kids today that are trying to get into college because the competition has become fierce.  I remember reading an editorial in the NY Times by a Harvard alumni who conducted student interviews for college entrance.  The editorial was titled something like "Another 4.0 Student Who Won't Get Into Harvard."  He then went on to lament how many complex extracurricular activities, interests, and volunteering a student had to engage in aside from having a 4.0 grade average, top SAT scores, AP courses, etc. these days.  He compared it to his days when the volcano demonstration at a science fair was enough extra sauce needed to spice your college entrance application.

The world has become complex, fast moving and incredibly competitive.  No wonder so many kids today are caving under pressure and not being given the chance to really explore who they are and what they are TRULY interested in.  I want my son to watch this.  He just graduated college, but not without it taking its mental toll.

The film brought me lots of smiles and a few tears as well.  Well done.  So well done.
