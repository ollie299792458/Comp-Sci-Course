Todd Field's digression from "In the Bedroom" to "Little Children" can only be compared to Paul Thomas Anderson's sinking from the gritty, realistic "Boogie Nights" to the lackluster "Punch Drunk Love" a few years later (from there Anderson basically dropped from sight for the next half-decade -- will Field's fate be the same?). Halfway through "Children" I was so bored I began googling the names of old high school classmates just to pass the time. The biggest problem I have with the movie is the spouses of Kate Winslet & Patrick Wilson. Winslet's husband is an internet-porn addicted loser and Wilson's (Jennifer Connelly) is a shrew who cares more about her work and her child than she does her husband. By portraying the spouses this way Field basically gives Winslet and Wilson a free pass to commit adultery which removes the elements of moral dilemma, suspense, and drama from their actions. Jackie Earle Haley's character, rather than being sympathetic, is just a loser, much like the spouses, so we don't really care about him either. I was excited to see this movie given how much I enjoyed "Bedroom" but vas very disappointed in it.
