Another pro-Lesbian/social engineering story, but this one is even less convincing.

Rachel (Piper Perabo) sees Luce (Lena Headey) on her wedding day. Instantly smitten by the woman, she doesn't quite know that she's yet in love. A side story to this is her own parents miserable marriage. Her father Ned (Anthony Head) and mother Tessa (Celia Imrie); who also played a lesbian in "Oranges are not the Only Fruit") have been un-happily married for many decades. And this marriage is supposed to be a parallel to what Rachel might go through if she doesn't follow her heart and go for the other woman, instead of staying married to Heck (Matthew Goode) and here's where it fails. She has been in love with him for some time. They are genuinely concerned about each other. Her 'love' for Luce is thus more a case of lust. Her father encourages her to go for the other woman, because he 'understands' what it's like to be in a marriage for the sake of the marriage. Thus this example simply fails as a means to showing why she should dump a man she made a commitment to, who in fact loves her so much that he won't stand in her way of her betraying him. It's not a comedy because this man's part in the film is totally tragic... with just a hint that he was contemplating suicide.

The message of this film is if you're suddenly struck by some new 'passion', go with it, just do what you feel. Don't worry about those you leave behind, who you've made promises to.

Piper's also had experience playing lesbians before ("Lost and Delirious").
