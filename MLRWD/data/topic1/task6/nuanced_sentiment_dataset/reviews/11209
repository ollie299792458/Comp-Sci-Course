As a long time fan of the ride, I was looking forward to this film.  However, this movie is not done in the spirit of the ride, but rather in boring and typical family films.

There are two competing stories in this:  The story of Eddie Murphy's family, in which he and his wife are real estate agents and he has trouble stopping work long enough to spend time with his family.  The second has to do with the history of New Orleans, tragedy, romance, and the supernatural.  Which sounds more interesting?

The story that Disney chose to work with for this was very bland and could have been used for another venue.  They had a fantastic set up and wasted the opportunity to do yet another story that few can relate to.  (Unless you happen to know a lot of people in high paying jobs whose only problems are forcing themselves to spend more time with their loved ones.)

I can say that the man who played Lord Gracy is a very fine actor, very talented and handsome (His voice is to die for.) and that you will have a treat with what little they do for his story.

All in all, I would recommend that you borrow the movie from a friend, unless you are looking for the cookie cutter type of family film that is far too prevalent these days.
