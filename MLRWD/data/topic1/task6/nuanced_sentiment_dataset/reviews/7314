The story of girls rejected from their families for giving birth out of wedlock -- or simply for being sensual -- should be horrifying. But "The Magdalene Sisters" manages to take a horrid, shameful period of Irish Catholic history and turn it into something tepid. In the 1940s, Irish girls are arrested and imprisoned in "reformatories" named for penitent prostitute Mary Magdalene. Here, they are overseen by mean nuns who makes them wash clothes all day. The nuns lock them in at night, dress them in plain clothes and make fun of their bodies at bath time. Though I find these practice repulsive, the movie did not convey the sense of horror, shame and betrayal felt by these girls. In the film, they come across more as crybabies than as hapless victims of a fanatical theocracy -- more like "Boo hoo hoo -- I had to wash a priest's underwear." The film had historical value, and might been cathartic to those closer to the story. But as someone who went through old-time Catholic grade school in the 1960s, with plenty of emotional levers to pull, I found that this film left me unmoved.
