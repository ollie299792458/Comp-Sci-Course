This movie was pretty good for an action movie, but since it was based off Clancy's bestselling books, it falls way short. I'd give it 1 to 2 stars for not following the book, hardly at all, and 4 1/2 for stand alone action and story.
Very thoughtful and present day reality to terrorism hitting the U.S. Affleck plays a decent Jack Ryan, albeit, he and Cathy are married in the book with one kid already. Enjoyed the stressful military sequences between the U.S. and Russia, although the bombing of the carrier was far fetched. Even in normal peacetime, the carrier would have a CAP (Carrier Air Patrol) aloft to keep an eye on things. Noticed an AWACS recon plane on the deck. Normally, it is in the air, plus there are usually several other ships in the Carrier Battle Group.
But I digress. Several other nuances, that bothered me, as I see it bothered others, was that it was set in 2002, with an unmarried Ryan. So, am I to believe that Patriot Games, Hunt for Red Oct, and Clear & Present Danger are set sometime in the future? 2005 or so?
Also, a nuclear bomb going off in Baltimore would have killed more people due to fallout/radiation and heat, even though it was low yield. Also, the terrorists in the book were Islamic, not Neo-Nazi. 
So, my suggestion is to not read the book before you see the movie, and if you have, then don't think of it as a Clancy movie, just a stand alone military action thriller.
