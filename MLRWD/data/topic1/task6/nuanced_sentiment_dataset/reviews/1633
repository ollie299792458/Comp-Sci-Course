I'm trying to remember. Wasn't this film enveloped in controversy on the cruelty to animals? Wasn't it the one movie that sent the Humane Society into action? I can't rightly remember. But whether this movie was controversial or not,there isn't a decent cowboy alive, then or now, that would treat their horses the way this movie portrayed. The scene where the horse goes over the cliff into the lake, is not fakery. Tie-wires are used to make the horses look lame, trip-wires to make them fall. 
I bought this movie because I had seen it when I was a kid. When I grew up, I thought I'd like to see it again. I don't know if I was more ashamed of the cruelty to animals or ashamed because I was duped into buying and seeing this movie again.
There's nothing about the true west in this movie. No history, no facts, just fiction and not even good fiction at that. There's nothing majestic about a horse being ridden to death.
Well . . . now I've said my piece, I hope you use some sense and don't be duped into buying this movie again like I was.
