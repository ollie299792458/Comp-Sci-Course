The Book of Revelation this is NOT for those likely to assume the movie is an adequate description of events portrayed there.  It is better viewed as hyperbolic post-modernism in which Nostradamas quatrains are integrated into a fixed calendar endpoint a la Mayan.  So, it's the atypical neutrino behavior that is behind the Earth's crust/core overheating and subsequent liquifaction/shift?  Nonscientists in the audience can be duped into believing this is a plausible scenario which is why Hollywood uses it as its point of departure.

And, how about the competing themes in the movie; one espoused by the geologist in which 'representative genetic stock is selected for salvation' and the other by the crass former US presidential Chief of Staff '1 billion euros per ticket, after all we're not running a charity'?  This interplay/confusion mars the script in that the audience is left to labor under a false dichotomy pressurized by the faux "crisis" created by the dreaded 'End of the World'.  In fact, no one knows how this interplay would work out in fact; yet, we have examples from our own history from both 9.11.2001 response and hurricane Katrina.  Likely, short term, the fallen nature of man would be plainly evident, but what if altruism was removed entirely from the equation?  This is the view of Revelation, when fallen man is left completely to his/her own devices without the restraint of altruistic urges.

The only couple of whimsical touchs in the movie is casting the actual Buddist llama of Nepal to represent himself and the attempt on the part of common Tibetans to claim a right of stowaway passage abord an exclusive, wealth- and superiority-driven Ark.
