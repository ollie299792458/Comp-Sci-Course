Although this movie doesn't go by the book AT ALL, it's still good. It's my favorite in the series.
It's basically about how Missie, the schoolteacher, is swept off her feet by a wealthy son of the owner of a railroad. But gradually, she finds herself doubting her feelings for him, and realizes that she really loves Willie Lahaye (yay), a young man with a troubled past.
Willie's story in the movie: years before, he is blamed for the death of his little brother after Willie can't find their way home on a cold winter night. His whole family breaks apart, and his father becomes very bitter. Willie runs away and for years goes by the name Nate. Then he shows up at the Davises, helps to save Clark's leg after it is infected (he has had a serious accident with an axe), and does all of Clark's work till he gets better. Why does he do all this? Because he loves Missie, of course. Just fyi, NONE of this is in the book. Willie then goes back to his father, hoping to patch things up, but his father is still too bitter. (By the way, his dad's house looks SO unrealistic. The wood walls and floor are PERFECTLY clean, and there is almost nothing in the house except a table, some chairs, and a stove.) Clark helps Willie to heal his past, and in the process makes himself look very fake.
The acting is good and the story is good. Very good message: don't marry the person to whom your FEELINGS belong, marry the person to whom your HEART belongs. Willie proved his love for Missie, and the other dude turned out to be a jerk. The romance is very sweet and touching, and you might even cry at the end. Missie looks absolutely GORGEOUS in her wedding dress and pink bonnet, but Willie...can't he even brush his hair for his own wedding? ;-)
