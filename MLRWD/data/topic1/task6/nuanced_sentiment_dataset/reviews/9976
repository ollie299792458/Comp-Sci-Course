I love this movie.  Very cute and fun.  A good movie to watch when you're feeling lovey dovey.  The Blu-Ray is awesome.

Unfortunately it gives me yet another reason to hate hate hate Ultraviolet.

Reasons Ultraviolet is awful:

1.  The ultraviolet code for this movie is on the wrapper that is the very first thing you throw away when you get the movie.
2.  I only found out that the code was on the wrapper by googling for it's location
3.  Obtaining the Ultraviolet digital copy can only be done by signing up for a Sony Movies account and then the linking of the Sony Movie account and the Ultraviolet Account fails with an error
4.  The Ultraviolet software (an Adobe Air program, an epic fail in itself but that's for another post) is extremely buggy and the UI has no way to redeem the movie codes you get.
5.  For those of you who don't know, Ultraviolet downloads don't work with your apple device.
6.  Need I say more.

Ultraviolet = Epic fail

Otherwise I love this movie.  Just wish that the movie studios would realize there's a reason Apple is winning and try to copy them not re-invent the wheel.  The wheel has been and invented.  They did it right the first time.  No need to make a square Ultraviolet wheel.
