I thought Micheal J fox was the perfect voice for stuart for one thing his often  comical yet distressed voice  that he used in the back to  the future trilogy worked perfectly.
  Geena Davis made the perfect Mom and  that  guy even if he was a child molester which I far from condone  played the role of the dad to a tee.  He didn't  do anything untowards to kids in the film so It doesn't come into play in my review anyways.  I thought  the  scene with the boat race was  perfect the best part.  Snowbell  had some great lines that if  my cat's spoke english I think they'd hardily agree to like " I gotta go lick myself, scratch and stare at traffic that could take hours if I do it right"  All together a charming comedy movie if you don't mind that  other then the films name and  the charictors names there is absolutely nothing  related to the book  in this film.  Even the boat race  is a far deviation from the book.  If you don't mind that  then it's perfectly  harmless family fun with alot less bathroom humor than the normal these days.  However I urge you when your kids are older read them or havem read the book.  EB White was a brilliat writer and deserves to have the classic story  at least be known as far from the  holloywood script.
