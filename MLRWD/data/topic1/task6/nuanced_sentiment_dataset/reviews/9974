What if a director could take all the very best concepts from Science Fiction films over the past thirty years or so, and bundle them all into one epic?  At the very least, it should be something worth watching.
Not so 'Mission to Mars'. It starts with what has now become traditional in Science Fiction disaster movies - astronauts and their families bonding around the barbecue while narrating their character's biographies. 
The film moves on, hanging its hat for while on 2001: Space Odyssey, and then grabs at bits and pieces from ET and Contact along the way. For a while, it almost becomes fun trying to work out just what film the director was trying to spoof.  But not real fun. 
Finally, in an almost fanatical attempt to save the last half hour of the film from total obscurity, a mad grab is made at both the Abyss and Starship Troopers.
At times the script and acting are so bad that the audience may be forgiven for concluding that the film was supposed to be funny.  But this is not so; the background music is serious, patriotic stuff and assures us that the director and producer (at least) are still hedging their bets on this jingoistic nonsense to be taken at face value.
Good acting may have saved this film.  Unfortunately, we'll never know.
