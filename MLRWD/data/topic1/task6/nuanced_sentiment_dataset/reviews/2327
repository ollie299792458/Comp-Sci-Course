The Simpsons Movie comes off as an enjoyable experience to long time fans of the show, with many of the original writers from the series.  I enjoyed it when I first saw it at cinemas, and my first viewing of the Blu-ray disc, which is highlighted by its excellent HD transfer (as the film is transferred from a true digital source) and its great DTS HD audio track.

However, after the initial viewing, the movie doesn't really pull you back in to watch it.  Sure, there are some great laughs, but the storyline feels a bit weak after more than a few viewings, it isn't much  more different than something that could be done in the TV series.  The special features on the disc only add to this cause as they feel quite lacking.  Once you have listened to the two audio commentaries (interesting and very funny), watched the short deleted scenes, watched the American Idol promos and viewed the 'easter egg', there's nothing more to do.  Would have been great if there were documentaries into the concepts and animation process, working with voice actors etc.

Fox could have done a lot more with the disc, maybe even utilized some of the more advanced features that Blu-ray has to offer (at present).  Its very possible that a double dip could be on the cards in the future.
