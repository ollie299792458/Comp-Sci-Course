The Boondock saints is a revelation.  The casting is a bit of mystery-for instance why Dafoe? but the film itself is impeccable.  Billy Connolly has a lamentably small part as a Leon type killer( even extended to the mantra given to him "no women no kids") but is obviously imbued with a sense of morality and "aequitas". The role is largely non speaking but the sheer physical impact is immense.  Similarly, Dafoe is a Norman Stansfield moulded cop, played with high camp and a love of classical music.  Oddly, however, the tone of Dafoes agent is perfect for a film which mixes surreal, brutal fantasy with  unrelenting reality.  Norman Reedus (aka Mr Helena Christenson) finally displays a flair for gritty acting and Sean Patrick Flanery finally sheds that "pretty boy" persona for which he has become synonimis  In style the film reminds me much of Phil Joanous "State of Grace", so much so in fact, at first I believed it to be older than it actually was.  There are faults with "Boondock saints" which cannot be ignored.  The violence is unflinching,often gratuitous and occasionally portrayed with cartoon like simplicity.  The ending over which the credits run is contrived and false.  However, despite these errors of judgement from Duffy, the sheer energy dynamism, pace and look of the film, not only marks him as a promising filmmaker, but also earns his debut an uncompromising five stars.
