Our story opens in Africa. With Father Phillip Lamont (Richard Burton), where he is performing an exorcism on a woman who is possessed by the demon Pazuzu. Now if you've seen the original Exorcist, Pazuzu is the name of the demon who posessed Regan MacNiel (Linda Blair). The woman then commits suicide by lighting herself with candles and burning herself to death. Now we are in New York City with our main character Regan. She is living with her childhood nanny Sharon Spencer (Kitty Winn). Who also was with Regan when she was first posessed when they lived in Georgetown while Regans mother was shooting a movie there. But now, Regan temporarily is living with Sharon while her mother is on location shooting another movie. Regan is also seeing a Phycologist to help her deal with her "problems." The doctor is played by Louise Fletcher. After the doctor has Regan use a Hypnosis machine to try and recall the night Father Merrin performed the exorcism on her. She never even forgot!!! Then Regan and Father Lamont (who was sent to investigate Father Merrins death) realize that still, inside Regan is a internal conflict. A conflict between good and evil. Then the next thing you know Regan and Father Lamont are going to Regans old house in Georgetown to fight Pazuzu. There was some stuff about Locusts. But I have no idea what that has to do with the movie! I hoped to see blood and Gore like in the first one. But it is still pretty good. But it could have been better. However I do recommend it to people who want to know the next chapter of the original horror hit.
P.S.- The Exorcist 3 is also good. Check that movie out too.
