I wonder sometimes what people see in these one-note comedies. You know the kind I mean--the kind in which there's not much to the movie beyond what you see in the poster. If you've seen that, and particularly if you've seen the trailer, is there really any need to actually sit through the movie? Billy Bob Thornton is mean and rude; he drinks and throws up on himself; and he's a petty criminal who rips off the department stores where he works. That's it. There's the joke.
Of course, this being a movie, the character must learn a valuable life lesson and earn some measure of redemption. The one positive thing I can say about this movie is that Zwigoff does NOT yield to what must have been intense pressure from the studio to make this film hokey as heck in the latter half. But it's still not much of a movie. But hey, most people seemed to love it, so if the idea of a really bad and disgusting guy as Santa Claus is funny to you, go for it. Billy Bob Thorton is certainly convincing in the role. Okay, that's two positive things.
