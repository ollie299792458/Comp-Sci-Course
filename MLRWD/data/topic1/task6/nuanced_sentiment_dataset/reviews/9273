Gulliver's travels staring Jack Black is a fairly decent comedy. If your not a fan of Jack's style of goofy humor you probably won't like this movie. It has nice special effects and the interaction between Jack Black's character and Jason Segal's character is pretty good. This version of Gulliver has him being stuck in the job of mailroom employee for some unnamed company. Long story short he get's shipwrecked and ends up on the island of Lillyput. He is giant sized and the inhabitants of the island are tiny. He becomes their general, tells tall tales and kinda goofs off. The people of the island can build anything and he has them build a big stage, i guess it's supposed to be his t.v. There are some funny Star Wars references and other pop culture stuff as he tries to pass it off as his life. The movie is short coming in at 85 minutes. My main pet peeve is there is no way to fast forward or skip to the main menu when you load the disk. There were 6 previews that your forced to sit through (i left and came back in about 10 minutes and the menu was finally up). A good cheap movie if you can find it under 10 bucks, i got mine used for 2 dollars.
