I had no idea what to expect when I received "The Grand" to review. I had never heard of it. And seeing the cast of well-known actors (Woody Harrelson, Ray Romano, Cheryl Hines), I didn't have a good feeling about it. It's been my experience these are typically flops if I've never even heard of them.

My presumption turned out to be largely correct. "The Grand" is cut from the same cloth as "Best In Show", "Spinal Tap" and the like, and in fact includes many of the same actors tha that you'd expect for what seems like the loosely-scripted genre that included Cheryl Hines ("Curb Your Enthisasm") and Michael McKean (who is in most of the Christopher Guest mockumentaries).

There are lots of familiar faces in this movie. David Cross (Arrested Development), Gabe Kaplan (Welcome Back, Kotter), Chris Parnell (Saturday Night Live), Dennis Farina, Estelle Harris. The actors all do a decent job but there just isn't much material to work with.

I do have one caveat. Poker has become big business in the USA, and it may well be that I am just "out of the loop" in this area and don't understand the subtleties of the game. There are some cameos from real poker players in this movie, and in fact Gabe Kaplan (skin stretched too tight for his years) has been a prominent poker player for years.

The acting is good, the story was not interesting to me, but this may well be worth a view if you're a big fan of any of the actors or the world of Poker.
