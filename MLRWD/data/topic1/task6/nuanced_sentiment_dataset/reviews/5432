I never knew who Tammy Faye was until 1987 and I was hoping for a good documentary about Tammy Faye but couldn't watch this because of the annoying, obsessive, angry, child-like temper tantrums directed at Christianity in this film along with Rupaul narrating in a raspy, annoying voice used in a way that takes too much of the focus away from Tammy Faye which this movie was about. No cool music accompanies this film.

Tammy Faye obviously was the first to say gays deserve respect and compassion but obviously after looking at these comments, it was not enough simply because she still clinged to her faith up to the end.

That's right she said it before any non-religious talk show host did.

Tammy was famous for her big make-up during the mega glam days of the 1980s where most women in the media were made-up a lot and obviously she impressed enough people resulting in a lot of cross-dressers worshipping her.

Something about Tammy made it clear she was a cool, compassionate woman who was mistreated by the media like no other woman has been. She was a lot more interesting to hear from than the same old media people and if you want to call someone a cartoon charater, look at oprah and her gurl 'friend' gale king.

Sad that Tammy died and never got a chance to do more in the media or recording industry. Pretty scary that so many people went on a shark frenzy when this woman suffered a fall. Tammy had compassion but her haters didn't. Vh1 would have made a better documentary about Tammy Faye than what is put forth here.
