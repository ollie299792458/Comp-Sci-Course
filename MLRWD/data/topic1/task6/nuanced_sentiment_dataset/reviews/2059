PRESENTATION:
Great presentation of five slim cases in one cardboard slipcover sleeve. DVD transfers look great. No subtitles in any language on the discs. Skits are unedited, which is great, since most people only got to see this stuff on Comedy Central.

CONTENT:
Dude. I bought season one and two at the same time because I looooooved the kids in the hall. I watched it all the time on Comedy Central. Loved it. I always knew there were some crappy sketches, but most were true comedy gold.... when I was 15.

So far, now into the middle of disc four, I've laughed out loud exactly twice, feigned a giggle once or twice to make myself feel better about the purchase, and the rest of the time I've done nothing but stare blankly at the screen.

I wish I could say it was hilarious, I wish I could tell you it's one of the best things ever put on DVD, but it's just not. Most of the jokes are too obvious, and when they're not, they're just stupid. There are some great ones, the two guys who say "Nobody likes us", or "Sarcastic guy",  but that's pretty much it, and not worth the price of admission to slog through the muck that is the rest of this series.

Hopefully season two is better?
