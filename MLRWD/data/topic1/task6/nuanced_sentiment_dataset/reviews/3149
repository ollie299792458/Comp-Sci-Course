.....the 3D sucks. Really. Bad. The MY BLOODY VALENTINE 3D Blu-Ray is phenomenal when compared to this junk...but at least you get to see it in 3D the way it was meant. The 3D itself isn't that bad, it's the set-piece killings that fall flat. When a object gets forced into the foreground (3D's purpose!) the split image fails to coalesce properly with these glasses, but the 3D effect in "normal" situations is fine. The film was meant to be viewed in polarized fashion, not anaglyph. But MY BLOODY VALENTINE was also shown in polarized 3D and given the anaglyph treatment on DVD with no problems, so who knows..?

Ok, rant over. The film rates a 4/5 stars in the Friday the 13th canon. The first four films are  the best, IMHO. The 2D version in Blu-Ray is probably the best we will ever get. I have compared every edition on DVD ever made for the US market through my 1080p HD projector onto a 100" screen (I know, I'm lucky!) and the Blu-Ray is tops. I would also like to point out that it seems the exact same print was used to make every DVD. All the artifacts, dust, hairs in the camera gate, etc. are exactly the same in every version. So, again, this is probably the best we can expect, sans some kind of digital clean up, which I'd be against. Although, as noted in other reviews, the "upgrade" to the Blu-Ray from the Deluxe Edition is a matter of personal choice, my advice: If you plan on watching the film on a screen over 40", then you might as well spend the extra $6 for the Blu-Ray.

Extras are nice, but not mind blowing and certainly nothing new is covered for the die-hard fan....I'd rate the extras 3/5 stars.

Overall, this is a welcome edition to my library. You may want to wait as the Blu-Ray will eventually fall in price, maybe even to the $12-$15 range by around November, as usual for these horror releases.

This Blu-Ray DVD is probably the best quality they can muster from the print, so I say 'job well done'. 4/5 stars. Recommended purchase.
