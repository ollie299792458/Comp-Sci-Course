I FOUND THE BOOK A CANT PUT IT DOWN AND THE MOVIE WAS FAIR.JOHN AND KEVIN ARE GREAT AND (SONNY) WAS AS REAL AS SONNY IS! LOL..  AS A CHATHAM COUNTY NATIVE I REMEMBER THE MURDER WELL. BUT WHAT I FOUND OUT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS MAY BE EVEN MORE OF A SHOCK TO SOME!THERE USE TO BE A SMALL "SOUL FOOD" DINER IN POOLER ABOUT THE TIME THE BOOK WAS TO BE MADE INTO THE MOVIE. LIZ THE OWNER AND I WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT FACT WHEN SHE DROPPED A "BOMB" ON ME. SHE SAID "I HATE THAT WRITER JOHN B...WHAT EVER HIS NAME...HE MAKES OUT LIKE ITS MURDER WHEN I KNOW BETTER. I WAS THERE THAT NIGHT!" THIS I HAD TO HERE.... SHE WENT ON TO TELL ABOUT THE SECRET OFFICE OFF FROM THE PALOR THAT SHE WAS IN THAT NIGHT.SHE DID COOKING AND SOME OFFICE WORK FOR JIM FROM TIME TO TIME. SAID SHE SAW HIM SHOOT DANNY AND DANNY INDEED TRY TO KILL JIM. AS SHE RELATED IT "JIM SHOT THAT BOY AND IF IT HAD BEEN ME I WOULD'A SHOT THE S.O.B. AGAIN! HE WAS NO GOOD! I ASKED HOW THE POLICE MISSED FINDING HER THERE...HER ANSWER WAS "'THAT SORRY BUNCH??? JIM TOLD ME STAY IN THERE AND BE QUITE AND I DID NO ONE KNEW ABOUT THE ROOM SO I WAS SAFE. IT WAS PAST 5AM WHEN I FINALY WAS ABLE TO SLIP OUT. LORD WHAT A NIGHT"! ALSO HAD THE PLEASURE OF CHATTING ON LINE WITH ED NORTON THE ALEDGED FRIEND AND SOME TIMES "LOVER" OF DANNY'S. SEEMS IT HOLDS TRUE THAT DANNY DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN WHO HE WAS WITH, MALE OR FEMALE AS LONG AS HE GOT WHAT HE WANTED. BUT AS BAD AS HE WAS HE WAS HANDSOME BAD A--! I ASK ED THE QUESTION OF WHAT DID HE THINK EVER HAPPENED TO DANNY'S BLACK CAMARO...HE SAID DONT KNOW BUT THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE WORTH NOW A DAYS.  THATS A THOUGHT! (HOPE YOU POST FOR THE FANS)
