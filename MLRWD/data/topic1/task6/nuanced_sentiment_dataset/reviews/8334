Having seen Ichi the killer and audition i stumbled across this special edition of izo in town on the new release wall and sparadically bought it due to the cool cover and Miike is pretty crazy and i was interested how he would do a samurai movie.oh but its not your typical samurai movie its miike's vision of a low leval samurai that was crucified then comes back as a unstopable killing machine that visits different time periods and slaughters everyone who stands in his way.easily one of the most violent movies ever .not as gruesome or disturbing as some of the stuff in ichi or audition but just more crazy sparadic killing.Thats were the problem sets in the movie is basically scene after scene of constant killing with some story thrown in between with old film of WW2 and other things then a song by a guy with an aucustic guitar.repeat.repeat.repeat that what this movie is composed of.i do respect what miike is trying to say and acomplish in this movie but it does try your patience,but it is for the most part a very beutiful,visual movie that i think you should watch at least once,but it is better the second time when you kind of realize what miike is trying to say and you can make some since out of the plot.or just watch it again for all the cool fights and non-stop killing.
