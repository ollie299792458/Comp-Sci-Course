This film is about a young Jewish man searching for his roots in the Ukraine, part of the former soviet union. He travels from America, where he lives, joins up with a translator, the translator's grandfather who is also their driver, and the translator's grandfather's dog.

All he has to go on is an old photograph of his grandfather and the young woman who helped him leave for America. Will he find the village where his grandfather came from? Why is the grandfather acting so mysterious? And who is the mysterious Augustine?

I'm not even sure of the answer to these questions, even though I've seen it. I didn't really understand what they were looking for, or why it was so hard to find. And I didn't understand the ending either. I think I was just missing something.  To be honest, I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be a comedy, a drama, or something else. It didn't really have enough suspense to make it work as a mystery, and it wasn't really funny enough to be a comedy I thought. Perhaps a few more twists in the plot would have helped, or more jokes. I also found the soundtrack off-putting and annoying at times.

On the other hand, my girlfriend liked it a lot. Apparently it's based on a book, though she said the film only covers half of the book, which she says is much better because you get a better idea of the history of the place he's looking for. She told me to read the book first before I jumped to conclusions, so I suppose I'll have to have a go at it and see if it all makes sense then.

In short, I'd say if you've read the book, this might be a good film, but if you haven't, as I haven't, you might find it confusing.
