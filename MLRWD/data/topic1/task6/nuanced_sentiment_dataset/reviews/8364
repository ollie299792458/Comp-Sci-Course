The film is easily five stars, but this Blu-Ray transfer only gets two. Despite so many reviewers complaining about film grain and shoddy picture quality/clarity, the main problem is that the image has been tampered with in regard to size. The picture quality is perfectly fine, considering that this film was not shot in hi-def and not even with a very big budget (this is as clear as M*A*S*H will get...and the image clarity is better than ever).

The only problem I have, is that the film's title did NOT fit on the screen (the left leg of the letter "M" and half of the right leg of the letter "H" are off screen when the title is shown during the film's opening). I immediately threw on my old standard DVD for a comparison, and that one fit perfectly. In fact, on the standard DVD, there is a comfortable margin of space on screen to the left and right of the title. This sizing error continues throughout the entire Blu-Ray version of the film. At one point, Altman holds a shot which is intended to be a take on "The Last Supper", and the character sitting on the far right end of the table is only half in the frame (this compromises the artistic intent of the director). I checked my television settings, and they were all in proper order.

This is one of my favorite films, and I hope this problem is remedied. I hope Criterion will eventually put out a release, as this is also a very important film.
