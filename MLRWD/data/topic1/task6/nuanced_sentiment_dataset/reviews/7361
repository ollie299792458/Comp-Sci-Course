Usually, watching a film adaptation of a book or story is a letdown. But in the case of Legends Of The Fall I'd have to say it is advisable to read the story before watching the film as it is helpful in understanding the motivations of the characters, even though the film differs greatly from the novella.

The film didn't--couldn't--portray character motivation as the story by Jim Harrison does. Watching the film without the background of the novella will have you wondering why the hell Suzanne and Tristan react like they do. It's difficult to catch the guilt of Tristan who fails to "take care of Samuel" and the manic depression suffered by Suzanne. The film, on it's own, cannot convey the clash of tradition against the new of the industrial revolution and a changing West.

Read the wonderful novella by Jim Harrison, then watch the film.

As an aside, a couple of years ago I went to a book signing of Jim Harrison's and someone asked him about his impressions of the film Legends Of The Fall. His reply was that, apparently, there must have been a lot of nearby laundry facilities in turn of the century Montana; everyone had such clean clothes in the film.
