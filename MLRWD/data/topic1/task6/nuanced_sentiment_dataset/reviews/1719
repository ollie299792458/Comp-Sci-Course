Barbarian Invasions is a very thought-provoking film like My Dinner with Andre, Before Sunset, Before Sunrise, and the play and HBO presentation of Wit, as well as other films. Remy, a boomer college professor who lived life on his own terms with little thought to how it affected others, is dying.  Deny Arcand has written and directed a story that sums up the meaning of his life and indirectly the strange legacy that his son's money is able to arrange by bringing people to his father's bedside. Without spoiling endings, Remy's almost one-dimensional, medieval view of death is ushered into a renaissance. Barbarians, if they are terrorists battling for attention or cancer shutting down the body or if they are immigrants or handsome male lovers bringing Italian truffles disrupt everything, we are no longer our own little universe. Life is transformed into something bigger with national health care, porches full of friends, lakes, drug addicts, migrating birds, nuns who value touch and the mystery, so many other people and tall trees that know the way up.  Of course, this is a production the draws you in with its wonderful acting, camerawork and direction.  It poses the problem that clinging to the past is like an early death against a backdrop of older offspring chanting they will be different. .  I welcome this invasion from Canada.
