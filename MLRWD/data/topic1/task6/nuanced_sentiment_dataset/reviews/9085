This film might be useful for someone who knows little about North Korea; it's a good starting point. I use the film myself with high school students who are studying George Orwell's "1984." However, there are a few caveats. The film emphasizes scenes of people bowing before portraits and statues of the Great Leader and the Dear Leader. In one stunning segment, blind people who've had corrective surgery (the film makers come in pretending to be part of a medical team) pull the bandages from their eyes and immediately begin praising the Dear Leader and kowtowing before his portrait. An ominous soundtrack adds to the surrealism. The implication (since this is the last segment in the film) is that all North Korean citizens have been completely brainwashed. As O'Brien, speaking of the Party, says to Winston in 1984, "We shall fill you with ourselves." Then the camera cuts away to images of ICBM's---and the implication clearly is that nuclear weapons are in the hands of a nation that is impervious to reason. North Korea is a bizarre, dangerous, and chilling place (read the recent memoir of the American deserter Charles Jenkins). But to summon up old canards about hordes of Asians in thrall, drone-like, to  fanaticism is to suggest that such people would be immune to diplomacy----and we know where that takes us. If you use this film in class (or just see it yourself), bring along a little skepticism about the choices film makers make to tell a good story. An interesting (and better) film  to see in conjunction with this one is Daniel Gordon's "A State of Mind," about two girls preparing for the North Korean mass games.
