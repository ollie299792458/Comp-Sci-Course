I am a huge Tap fan, and when I heard that the Blu-Ray version was to include the commentary from the Criterion Collection version, I eagerly paid early to get on the waiting list for this release. After waiting several months for the Blu-Ray, I realize it's been a waste. The Blu-Ray DOES NOT contain that commentary; rather, it is the same (albeit hilarious) commentary from the special edition DVD release from a few years ago. The only new material is a concert video for Stonehenge (trying lamely to recreate, or maybe reboot, the scene from the mockumentary...it doesn't work), and a series of brief interview clips of Nigel Tufnel discussing Stonehenge (the monument) in connection with a recent special on National Geographic. This is painfully bad, as Guest acts hostile and arrogant, completely out of character from his childlike and enthusiastic portrayal of Tufnel in the film. So, about 30 minutes of poor extra material is dropped onto an extra disc, to give you the impression that this is special material. Otherwise, all the bonus features, etc. from the DVD are here. Don't expect a better picture, either, since the film grain and age of the film are quite apparent.
