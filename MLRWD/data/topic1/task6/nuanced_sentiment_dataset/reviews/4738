A polished, partisan reinvention of Dayton's historical events.  Alleged appeals to sentimentiality at every opportunity and doesn't let truth get in the way of its apparent mission, to trash Darwin's theory.

Mencken and evolution are both demonized: Mencken was a hard-edged skeptic, but not the scheming cynic depicted here.  No informed person would make any connection of Darwin and natural selection with eugenics or "food-chain" social theory.  These are simply evangelical anti-Darwin canards.

In the film Darrow's stature is only grudgingly acknowledged, and the tragedy of Bryan is whitewashed (an aging reformer, formerly dynamic, who retreated into tub-thumping self promotion; shortly after the trial he died in Dayton, from overeating).  Nor was Dayton the generous, integrated and tolerant town portrayed here (in fact, frequently grotesque and mean-spirited during the trial).

The mawkish script is tailored for evangelicals and fundamentalists, the only ones who will excite over such agitprop. Thoughtful viewers who know the history will be appalled.

There has been some really excellent drama dealing with the Scopes trial -- think Spencer Tracy.  Although advertised as a historical portrayal, this movie's producers have a transparent agenda -- unrelated to being factual.
