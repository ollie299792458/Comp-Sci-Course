As a fan of the original Hawaii Five O I was thrilled when they remade the show and couldn't wait until Monday night to watch it.  Season one rocked.  The second episode of Season two it all fell apart.  I have no idea who thought Lauren German was the right person to add to the cast (when it should just be the original four anyway) because she was as exciting to watch as watching paint dry.  I can think of a thousand other actresses who would have done a much better job and who would have actually had chemistry with the main stars.  Because of Alex, Grace, Scott, and Daniel I forced myself to watch the show because I kept praying someone would come to their senses and kill off Lori Weston( Lauren). All the lines that should have been Grace's went to Lauren and there was just nothing she couldn't do.  It was ridiculous. It took a while but once she was gone the show started to get back to what I liked about it in the first place.  The guess stars were awesome.  I so hope they bring back Scott Caan's dad James because he just nailed his role.  Alex missed a couple of episodes and he was so missed.  Hopefully season three they will get better writers and we can get the show rocking like it did in season one.
