I'm not sure if we saw the same movie.. but what i saw was a MEAN danny glover trying to run tarzan off the land so he could put up a hotel! in the animation field, this would be called, 'animotion', meaning: to move  oneself through drawing and 3D computer graphics. this is also demonstrated  in a lot of other movies where stopped motion effects are neccessary in  order to get the computers to animate in 3D full colour. i spent 3 years  studying the ancient art of traditional and new wave animations and art  supplies. so, from a technical stand point, i can really try and recommend  this picture... because technically speaking, there is alot of 'animations'  performed through out. however, the story is not revealing enough for the  animotion (not to be confused with animations) to play out the character of  the hotel prospector / tyrant who reqiures more 3D visuality but less of  the stopped motion (this is where the animation is 'stopped' there by  giving the *illusion* of 'stopped motion') to carry out his deeds against  tarzan. tarzan, on the other hand, enjoys the full benefit of colour and  computer graphics. he can carry out his performance through these  techniques of *blue screens* and animotions. but you can't stop them.. it's  important to know that.
