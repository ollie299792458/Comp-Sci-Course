Reading the reviews, it seems obvious that those that like AI somehow think that those that do not are of lower intelligence, or lack "class".
The divide drawn by this movie reminds me more of how much America is big on sentiment. People who dislike AI aren't as misinformed or unintelligent as some may think - given that many of those that dislike it happen to like Kubrick films. But AI is what I like to term an "Oscar-whoring" movie - it attempts to sell on emotion. It's not so much about conveying vision, as it is about soliciting emotion.
AI does have a philosophical background - it surfaces at times. At other times, it's sunk deep below the numerous layers of emotion solicitational goo, to be visible...
Overall, AI is an okay movie. However, (as mentioned before) it tries to be too sentimental, and definitely drags on for too long. The last third of the film is disconnected enough to belong in another one. And it's not just the elapsed millenia. The flow of the last third of the film is very irregular - it accelerates quickly, then slows to a crawl, then accelerates again. That's hardly great filmmaking - just proof that there were two highly separated visions involved in making this film.
In general, I recommend anyone interested to see this film - it has its moments. It's not "the best thing since sliced bread" but it's also not irrepairably horrible. It's just filled to the brim with Spielberg's main ingredient - lots and lots of sentiment with little regard to the original director's vision.
