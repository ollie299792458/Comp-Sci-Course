While typically gaudy, lavish and tuneful,  "Week-end in Havana" doesn't have the sparkle and fizz, the glitzy pizzazz of its Fox stablemates of the time: "Down Argentine Way" and "That Night in Rio".  Alice Faye seems rather too mature a lady to be playing a ditzy shopgirl.  Betty Grable would have brought more youthful feistiness to the role.  And John Payne, a typical college nice guy, doesn't have the macho charisma of Don Ameche, the co-star in the other two musicals I've mentioned, to bring much vibrancy to his part.  Put  Payne and Faye together, and they're eclipsed by the exuberant Carmen Miranda and Cesare Romero, those reliable Latin-American stereotypes, who enliven the thin plot  in every one of their scenes.  Carmen, by now in her third screen appearance, was already trapped in the role of second=lead spitfire entertainer she would repeat again and again in over a dozen movies over the next ten years, never disappointing us with her always energetic and entertaining performances.  This is a lazily enjoyable entry in 20th Century Fox's output of musicals in the early forties.  Not one of the best, but still fun to see.
