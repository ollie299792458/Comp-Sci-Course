Never heard about this movie until I was browsing DVDs at a box-office chain store, where two guys were looking at it and one said "Yeah talk about A-to-M, chuckle". So, naturally I had to check it out. Now overall the movie was pointless. Horror flicks should have some redeeming social commentary aspect to be good or at least some psychological mind-f'ing to them that causes you to have goose-bumps: this film has neither. What it does have though is a really good villian actor, the Doctor is sublimely creepy and does an excellent job of being Mister Mad Scientist: the scene where he is describing the upcoming 'surgery' is priceless. If a nazi-scientist archetype he was supposed to be he pulled it off to a Tee. Next, the concept was disturbing to say the least, though after watching Salo, it's tough to compare 'disgusting' to anything else. [Spoiler*] The ending scene, the hapless (hopeless?) situation of the *middle*-pede after what happens to the other two 'ends' is a terrorfying idea, and a heck of a way to end up. Disturbing. Lastly, the lighting was great; the bluish-black overwash gave the film a great feel, and the scenes were well done.

But other than the villian, the concept and the lighting, the movie was boiler-plate bordem.
