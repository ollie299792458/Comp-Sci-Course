Just watched this movie yesterday... and found it kind of hard to follow at times. To be fair, I may have been a little distracted while I was watching...  I thought the acting was fine by all (I probably wouldn't have been interested in watching it if it weren't for Jet Li).  I do question whether or not any of the animals in the this film were actually harmed.  I think I am going to swear off of any more Asian films as they do not have laws & organizations to protect the animals in filming. I would be EXTREMELY disappointed in Jet Li if he did participate in the making of a movie in which animals were treated with such disregard. The American Humane Association rates some of the newer movies, as well as having an archive of older movies which you can review before supporting any film if interested....  Unfortunately, this one is not listed on their website.  It's disturbing how flippant some of these film makers are about the animals' welfare in filming...says a lot about their character.
