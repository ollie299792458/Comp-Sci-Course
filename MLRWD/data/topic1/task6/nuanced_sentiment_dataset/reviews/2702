I am an avid follower of the TV Series of Buffy (which I cannot recommend highly enough).  I heard that the movie was weak compared to the series, but I thought I ought to see it - if nothing else for posterity's sake.

Sitting through this film was painful.  The intention of the film was to embody "CAMP". (over the whit that Whedon founded the humor of the series on later.)  The acting is so poor you feel as though the actors are cut from cardboard.  The lines drop stiffly from their mouths.  The effects are embarrassing.  (I am so glad the vampires in the series don't float and fly.  You can literally feel the wires tugging them upward here.)  My husband who is a staunch Buffy fan got up and left halfway through because he just couldn't endure it anymore.

One quirk - look for a cameo of a very adolescent Ben Affleck during the basketball game.

This movie did give me one thing - a deeper appreciation of Joss Whedon for rising above the failure of the original movie, starting over fresh, and creating an amazing series.
