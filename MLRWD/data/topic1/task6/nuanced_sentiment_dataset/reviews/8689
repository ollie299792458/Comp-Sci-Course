The picture quality of this dvd is full-bodied and sharp in comparison to earlier video releases where the tone was cloudy and muddy and a little too yellow. The picture is full frame which is sad but we can't expect Criterion treatment all the time! There's not too much wear, except  early in the film where speckles and edge enhancements make guest appearances from time to time but having seen this film in theaters, on video and even network TV, I must say it's the best that may ever be presented.
The only annoying aspect is the so called "Dolby Digital 2.0"
you might as well just say "enhanced mono" the highs are slightly muffled and the lows are hollow and the songs are left without their Badfinger punch. 
But at least listenable and good to see this wonderful Ringo Starr and Peter Sellers satirical comedy  available in at least a  half way decent format. No extras not even a theatical trailer, but again this isn't Criterion, whereby if it was we may have been lucky to have  gotten a running commentary by Mr. Starr or at least a brief  video introduction.
Most recent reviews state this film is rather dated, however the nucleus of the film still rings true today, if not more so, that everyone has their price.... and the price tag on  this DVD is at least worth every pence!
