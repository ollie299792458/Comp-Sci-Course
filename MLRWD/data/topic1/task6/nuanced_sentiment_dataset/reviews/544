since some wise guy has reviewed this as 4 stars 4 times in a row, and i think its worth 3, im gonna give this film two to balance it out.

  The plot is pretty weak, basically a scientist developed a virus called chimera, which he found kills red blood cells at an increasingly rapid rate, when tested on a patient,who died after 24 hours

  The fact that the virus comes into the hands of 'terroists'and they have to be stopped before it is unleashed on the world, already makes this film rather formulaic and unoriginal.

  All the gimmicky face changing doesnt add to the suspense, it just annoys the viewer, because its a easy way to create twists in a film with a weak plot.

  Theres a variation on the big rope drop into a computer room which was the main part of the first movie. From this point on theres a lot of action and killing of the bad guys, and it becomes obvious that John Woo knows what hes doing in this respect.

  Finally Tom cruise should be praised for the stunts he performs in the movie, the mountain climbing sequence and the motorcycle showdown are both top class stunts.

  So overall, youre looking at a film with patches of shooting and fighting action mixed in with a dull script and uninspiring acting performances. Go see the first one if you want a proper storyline.
