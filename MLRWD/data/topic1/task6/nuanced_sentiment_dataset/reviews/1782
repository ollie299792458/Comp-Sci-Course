I love our National Parks and Memorials, and think they are some of our greatest national treasures.  I have personally visited Yellowstone National Park, Grand Tetons National Park, Glacier National Park, Acadia National Park, Zion National Park, Bryce National Park, Olympia National Park, Mt. Rainier National Park, Mesa Verde National Park, Arches National Park, Everglades National Park, Great Sand Dunes National Park, Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, Sequoia National Park, Devil's Tower National Monument, Grand Canyon National Park, Navajo National Monument, Crater Lake National Park, Mammoth Cave National Park,  Mt Rushmore National Monument, and Badlands National Park.  I was so looking forward to the latest Ken Burns movie, National Parks - America's Best Idea, but I was terribly disappointed.  I wanted to hear some of the history, but I didn't want it to be a large chunk of the series.  I often felt like I was hearing Dayton Duncan's vacation story, and why the park was important to him.  I expected the most beautiful scenery I had ever seen, vistas that are often overlooked, interviews with the people visiting the park, tips on must see excursions, etc.  I was hoping to see things that I missed, and be inspired to return to the parks to experience them.  I felt rather empty after seeing this series, with my past experiences remaining my guiding compass to return to the parks, experiencing new venues and re-experiencing previous highlights.  My memories of a butterfly landing on my small child's finger in Acadia, seeing coyotes running through the campground in Yellowstone, camping in Navajo National Monument with only 2 other groups in the park and being spooked by the wind, going whale and puffin watching off the coast of Acadia, and walking around the glaciers in Glacier National Park, will continue to be some of the reasons I go back to the parks.
