This is not an example of genius moviemaking.  The movie stars Statham and Jet Li, so you really shouldn't have been expecting it to be.  Both are impressive action stars, neither is a great actor.  Pair those strengths and weaknesses with a pedestrian script and you get "War."  A fun diversion, but not something you should analyse too closely.

Statham plays an FBI agent who's partner is killed by a triad hitman called "Rogue."  Flash forward three years and most of the cliches that go with "man on a mission" movies have occurred.  Statham is divorced and estranged from his child as a result of his single-minded pursuit of the killer, blah, blah, blah.  I know, I know... this sounds like every movie where someone is holding a gun on the promotional poster.  But wait...

Statham's character picks up the trail of the killer and we are treated to some tough-cop scenes.  Meanwhile, Jet Li provides us with an oddly human assassin that somehow doesn't quite jib with the picture that's so far been painted of "Rogue."  Li sets out to pit a Yakuza clan against a Triad one.  Killing upon killing commences.

Once the clans are out of the picture, it's time for the big showdown and a twist that while you didn't exactly see it coming, you're not exactly surprised by it either.  I won't put the details out as I'm usually irritated by reviews that give away the point.

I've admittedly glossed over the action scenes in the movie.  There's a reason for that.  People familiar with Statham and Li know that anytime fighting goes on in one of their movies, they'll be just fine.  They are here as well.  You'll walk away with two complaints.  The first is that Statham and Li never really square off in the kind of hand-to-hand showdown that you paid the money to see.  The second is that for a movie with two of the biggest action stars going, there's not nearly enough action.
