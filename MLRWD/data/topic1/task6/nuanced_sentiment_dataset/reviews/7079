The movie was even better than the book for a few reasons. First of all, I had the chance to SEE what I had been reading for the last month: the spring, Winnie looking at it thinking whether she would like to drink from it or not, Jesse falling in love with her, pure sadness in Tuck's home, Miles telling his own tragedy and more. Then, I could picture myself on Winnie's shoes, which I could not by only reading the book: What it would be like to be the same person for 10 years, with the same old routine, and all of a sudden change and grew up in less than one week? Would I keep the Tuck's family secret, or not? Finally, I love the plot and the fact that we can see this girl becoming a woman and how she goes through it, asking herself the biggest question of all times: Would I like to live forever?
Moreover, the end is one of the most enjoyable parts of the movie with Jesse coming back to the woods, I could feel his relief because she had the life he could never have.
The thing that attracted me the most was the voice-over with the soft music, I could actually feel a every sad or happy moment with only one phrase: "You don't have to live forever, you just need to live" and she did.
On balance, this is what I call "Real Fantasy". A fantasy that looks real because we can actually ask ourselves if we would do the same as the main character. Any of the main themes of the plot can happen to us: growing up, making important decisions, changing our mind, finding new friends with secrets and falling in love with an unreachable and everlasting dream.
