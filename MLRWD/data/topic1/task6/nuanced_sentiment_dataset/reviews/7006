The first thought that I had in watching this movie was: this must be the attempt at a feminine edition of Indiana Jones.  Unfortunately, Angelina Jolie just isn't very convincing.  Granted, the story was pretty good.  The idea of the Illuminati wanting to take over the world through the Triangle of Life seems good enough.  However, what really did this movie in was the special effects, or lack thereof.  Everything felt sooo...."video-gamish".  It was so predictable.  Croft would find objects so easily, and then from out of nowhere, would be monsters that she would have to fight and annihilate....and she would....then move on to the next adventure.  It just seemed that the flow of the movie was so predictable....it really hurt the story's credibility.  Don't get me wrong, if you are in the mood for a good romp...then by all means watch this movie.  Just don't expect an intellectual thriller.  Indiana Jones is a much better series for that kind of thing.  Just sit back and ENJOY this one!
