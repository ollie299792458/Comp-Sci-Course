Many of the reviews have recounted the political and artistic atmosphere against which this film was made. All fascinating. I am, however, genuinely baffled by the appreciation for the special effects. Many, many other films of the period staged far more realistic maritime tragedies than this film was able to achieve. Almost all of the studio-bound shipboard scenes fail to acknowledge any sense of water movement, even after the ship hits the iceberg. Mostly the scenes are static, unhurried, with no relationship to a sinking ship. And the ship models are comically toy-like, with the Titanic sinking ever-so-slowly (until the very end, when it zips under the water in mere seconds), and the water as smooth and unaffected by weather as an indoor swimming pool. Once they actually, belatedly start to tilt the sets and camera, and douse everything with water, there is a half-reel or so of genuine, kinetic screen excitement. But even in early silent films, the effects far outstrip this clumsily directed oddity.
