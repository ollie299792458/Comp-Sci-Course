I saw this film for the first time a little over a year ago, and I instantly fell in love. I think the direction of the film, teaching us about the true history of big wave riders was very well done. (I would expect nothing less of Stacy Peralta though.) This film is everything you've ever wanted to know and see about big wave surfing. If you're more attracted to the old surf lifestyle, but you like a little newbie mixed in, you'll buy this film before you forget. NO collection should be without it. The commentary by the legendary Greg Noll is worth more than money itself. The man is a genius! Laird Hamilton is of course, another superstar, and you see some really great big wave action in here as well. They cover all of the greatest spots including Waimea Bay...Mavericks, CA...the north shore of Oahu...I'm telling you, if you're ANY kind of surf enthusiast or you just simply wanna know more..or you love the sport more than life itself...you will love this dvd. It's one of my all time favorites! :)
