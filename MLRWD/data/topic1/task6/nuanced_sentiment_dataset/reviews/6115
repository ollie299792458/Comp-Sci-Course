Gantz is pretty much Battle Royale done right. And if you're not familiar with that movie, you may not be able to watch Gantz. If you're familiar with the survival horror, you're familiar with the themes of strangers not-quite-working together in terrible circumstances, and a horrible impersonal *mysterious* authority in the background. Gantz develops these themes, with a group of mismatched strangers being forced to hunt down odd aliens living in Japan, with neither explanation nor help from an odd 4' wide black ball. Like much of the survival horror genre, Gantz is uncompromisingly violent, and one of the main characters is a sex object, for further character development of another main character. But unlike the Battle Royale movie, Gantz takes time to show the lives of its characters, with some episodes devoid of the alien hunt. Indeed, the first arc, which is almost an introductory one, is eight episodes long.

Unfortunately, the 2-episodes per disk format is quite irritating, as I found myself watching the first eight episodes all in one sitting. The last arc is not based on the manga, and is a much weaker story than the first two. And, while the series ends at 26 episodes, the bizarre questions behind the black ball are not answered. Thankfully, Dark Horse comics will be publishing the manga, so we can continue to view this series.
