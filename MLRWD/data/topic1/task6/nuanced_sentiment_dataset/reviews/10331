The Extended Director's Cut is definitely NOT more uproarious than the original DVD version. I watched about 10 minutes of this Blu-ray version, grabbed the case and saw that it was a different version from the original. I ejected the Blu-ray and popped in my DVD original version. This Directors cut gave me a new appreciation for the job of editing movies. I looked up the editor of the original version. John Carter you did an excellent job of editing on the original DVD version. I don't know how much if anything you had to do with this "Directors cut" version but it sure does change the whole mood of the movie. Director F. Gary Gray did a wonderful job of directing but he should have left the movie unchanged for the Blu-ray release. The original DVD version is CLASSIC, 5 stars (even with Ezal's exaggerated acting). The Director's version simply "screws up the mood" and is worthy of one star. Future Blu-ray releases should be the original version only with the scenes that were originally cut and that you want the audience to see in a "deleted scenes" menu.
Note: F.Gary Gray had a minor role as the kid sweeping in the neighborhood market.
