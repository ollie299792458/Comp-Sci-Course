We were lucky enough to catch Keen Eddie when it first debuted on television. Incredibly clever and funny, with great cinematography, we were also drawn to the characters.  "Eddie", the star, is a very cool NY detective banished to England to try and pick up the pieces after a drug bust went really wrong.  Conflicts and differences between American and English styles, attitudes and language add to the humor in a very witty way.

He's definitely sexy and easy to relate to- even when you are as cool as Eddie, things occasionally go wrong. Yet, when the chips are down, his attitude bounces right back, with a "Hi. I'm Eddie.  How do you like me so far?" Pretty darn well!

Despite positive reviews..."A rich blend of comedy, action and off-center characters"; "fresh and engaging"; "Keen Eddie eschews stern, solemn drama for breezy dialogue and eccentricities" and "The ultra modern look combined with traditional British images results in a unique and refreshing style"...the series was canceled during its first season. We were very happy they released that first season on DVD (thirteen episodes), six of which were never aired on network television. For those who missed it the first time around, or regretted its demise, here's your chance to enjoy a full season. The shows are varied, the supporting cast wonderful, it's definitely a winner.
