I've never seen the Toy Story movies.  First awesome thing about this movie was the price: $30 for this movie AND Toy Story 2 on Blu.

The movie itself is pure gold and I have no idea how I missed out on watching this.  Having went so long before watching it, the best part for me was guessing the voice actors - John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and the greatest drill sergeant ever, R. Lee Ermey amongst others.  I think there's a little Sid (sp?) in all of us men when we were young...come on who didn't want to blow up something of ours at one time or another?  If you ever wondered what your toys were up to when you weren't looking...well your questions will be answered and then some.  The mangled toys were definitely creepy but cute in their own weird way, especially when saving the day for Andy's toys.  The picture quality is crystal clear and if you have an optimum Hi-Def setup, the sights and sounds are breathtaking.  The ending skate chase in particular is reference material for the ages.

As an added bonus, registering this Blu-ray (and Toy Story 2 on Blu) with Disney rewards netted me 2 tickets for Toy Story 3 which was icing on the cake.  I easily recommend this movie if you're the last person on this planet who hasn't seen it.
