Having been born and raised in the South, I've seen firsthand the injustices heaped on the black population.  My father, who passed away a few years ago was raised on the farm in South Carolina and testified that the black population was an unfortunate breed of humanity, void without consience or reason and deserved total disclipine.  In 1985, when the movie came out, my parents felt that the world will cease to exist as we know it.  What they DID'NT know was that THE COLOR PURPLE was directed by Steven Spielberg, a white man and one of my parent's favorite directors.  When it came out on video, I, on impulse decided to rent it and see what the hulabaloo was all about.  After 2+ hours of raw emotion, I decided to tell my parents about this movie.  I rented it again and took it to my parent's house.  Picture this: My parents, friends and relatives thought I should have been tied up and sent to Happy Acres.  I told them to humor me and watch it.  The hardest hit was my father.  He went out to the video store the next day and bought it and watched it over and over again.  He was a changed man.  I know this is way overdue, but I applaud Steven Spielberg for having the courage to direct this movie in spite of its unpopular themes.  This movie is a classic for all time.  It ranks up there with Gone With The  Wind.  I can't watch the end of this movie without being cynical.  At every viewing, it's like watching it the first time.  A classic.
