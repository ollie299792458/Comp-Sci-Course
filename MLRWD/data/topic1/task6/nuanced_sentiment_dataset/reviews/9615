Don't get me wrong - I've loved this movie since I saw it as a child, but this release leaves much to be desired.  There are many good points of course: the commentary by Lokke Heiss, production and concept art, the restoration quality of the film, and even the design of the case, with a great Albin Grau painting of Max Schreck as Count Orlok.
On to what I didn't like about it: first, the tinting of the film.  I've alwasy seen Nosferatu presented in stark black and white, and this always added to the creepy feel of the movie.  However, Image Entertainment has chosen to use bright tints on the film in order to more clearly present moods, locations, times of day, etc.  supposedly, this is how it was originally presented?  It is quite distracting, and I feel it takes away from the quality of the video.  My second issue is with the soundtrack options, of which you get two new ones.  The first, by the Silent Orchestra, gets the right mood sometimes, but is too full and modern for this movie.  It's very out of place.  The second, an organ score by Timothy Howard, is too quiet, very bland, and adds nothing to the mood of the film.  This being a silent movie, the music is a very important part, and I feel that both of these fail miserably at reflecting what is occuring on the screen.  
It makes me long for earlier VHS editions I've seen, which, even though their video quality wasn't as good, were in regular B&amp;W and had appropriate soundtracks which succeeded at mirroring the action on screen.  Oh well, I can wait for another...
