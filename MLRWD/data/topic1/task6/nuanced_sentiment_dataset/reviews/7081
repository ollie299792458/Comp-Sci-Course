I totally had no problems with this film.  I've seen plenty of vampire films too.  Blade, Daybreakers, Near Dark, 30 Days of Night, The Lost Boys, you name it.  Was it as good as Daybreakers?  Hmmm.......almost.  Was it as bad as say......Dracula 2000, etc?  No way.  It was fine.  Albeit I rented it first and did NOT purchase it (hey sometimes the reviewers have it dead pegged, other times, its a case of some people just picking apart similarities to other films.

Did this film blatantly rip off other films?  Not BLATANTLY! Jeez, you wanna see a blatant rip off?  Watch how the new Spiderman trailer rips off the video game Mirror's Edge.  This film was cool, and honest, glad to see a Mad Max crossed (no pun) with a vampire flick.  And at 88 minutes, it gets in, does what it needs to do, and gets out.

I couldn't give it a 3.5, but I might have,  I dunno if it was a solid 4, I just know that the group I watched it with declared it was nowhere as near a huge disgrace as people give it.
