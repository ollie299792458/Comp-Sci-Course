This is my favorite movie of all time. It is one of the campiest movies ever made (although completely unintentional considering it was suppose to be a serious portrayal of child abuse, ha!).  Faye goes over the top as Joan Crawford in an unforgettable performance.  I'm just gonna make a few comments about other reviews on this site for this movie. Faye's acting was not cheesy, it was over the top. That is a big difference.  Also, for anyone out there that really was abused as a child, well this is not the movie for you. Although, my childhood was not all daisies and lolly pops, and I still find this movie hilarious.  I don't believe that Joan Crawford should get reamed for being a strict parent (yes, some things went too far, but how do we know this actually happened?).  Christina is just trying to cash in because Joan didn't leave her a cent in her will.  Christina coulda been a spoiled little brat who deserved to get beat down, we'll never know. But, one reviewer here had it right, in the 1940's and '50s..PARENTS WERE RUTHLESS when it came to discipline.  I hear stories from that generation that would rival this movie. Also, Joan had a horrible childhood too, some even say that her obession with having no wire hangers in the house is because when she was a young child, her and her single mother lived in the back of a laundry and Joan's job was to hang all the clothes on wire hangers. In the end, it's great entertainment that contains some of the best lines in cinema history ("No Wire Hangers!", "Tina, Bring me the Axe!").  Definitely one of the collection.
