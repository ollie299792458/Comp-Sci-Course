I was waiting my whole life for a movie like this.  This movies focuses on six teams of people who are each given a key and expected to race hundreds of miles to Silver City, New Mexico to win 2 MILLION DOLLARS!  Each key has a tracking device on it so the casino owner/ billionaire Donald Sinclair (John Cleese) can keep track of them.  Back at his casino he has other billionaires betting on who they think will win.  Includes an all star cast which includes the funny and talented : Rowan Atkinson, Jon Lovitz, Whoopi Goldberg, Cuba Gooding Jr, Seth Green, Vince Vieluf, Breckin Meyer, Amy Smart, Kathy Bates, and Dave Thomas.  Along the way, they run into:  Flying cows, hookers, retarded psycho squirrel merchants, evil hardware store men, I LOVE LUCY impersonators, stripers, Adolf Hitler worshipers,  and insane cab drivers.  There is only one bad thing about this movie: I missed half of it because I was too busy rolling on the ground in hysterical tears. OUCH!!!  It hurts to laugh for the WHOLE movie.  MUST SEE!!!!  NOW!
