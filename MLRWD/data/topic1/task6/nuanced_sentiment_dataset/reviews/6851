Missed this film when it came out, but was well aware of the premise from reading Starlog (R.I.P.) Magazine.  Had only caught bits and pieces of it on cable.  This film does not disappoint.  A classic bit of time travel with subtle humor.  Also neat to see 1970's San Francisco.....serves as a mirror to the recent past to see the way we were.....cool cars (when was the last time you saw an early model Honda Civic???), funky clothes.....through the eyes of a time traveling Victorian....special effects are minimal, and not that special, but the time machine is pretty cool, concept of H.G. Wells as the Time Traveler may have been borrowed from George Pal, but a good idea is a good idea...Malcolm McDowell is great in the role of Wells as a utopian socialist, though somewhat more repressed than I believe him to have been, historically Wells was apparently the lady's man.....hard to believe, but true.....Jack the Ripper is an awesome villian, always.....video stalled on me one time, but I believe that is just a problem with myh DVD player....video transfer was excellent....nice London sets....I can imagine what would happen if this film was made today.....would look like a video game with CGI, i.e. the recent Sherlock Holmes movies.....anyway, a big thumb's up!!!!!
