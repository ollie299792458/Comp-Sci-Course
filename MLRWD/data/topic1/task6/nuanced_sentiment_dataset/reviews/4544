I couldn't wait to see this movie, because I am SUCH a fan of the Pulitzer Prize winning book "The Killer Angels." GREAT BOOK! The movie, while not nearly so great, is amazing in its scope and the sense of scale it gives to the story.

Ted Turner set out to bring the book to the screen, and the best decisions were to invite thousands of Civil War re-enactors to be extras in the film, and to film on location at Gettysburg. Nothing like thousands of people passionate to get it right, especially when you put them at the site of the actual battle.

Jeff Daniels is excellent in his role, as is Richard Jordan. Tom Berenger does a very good job portraying General Longstreet. Unfortunately, this is probably Martin Sheen's worst acting ever. I'm sure Robert E. Lee rolled over in his grave every time Sheen appeared on screen.

Despite my criticism of some acting and the fact that it really doesn't do the book justice in explaining the Southern point of view regarding the war, this film delivers some really fine perspective on this pivotal battle. Crank the surround sound during the battle scenes, and you can appreciate the courage it took to charge against all odds.
