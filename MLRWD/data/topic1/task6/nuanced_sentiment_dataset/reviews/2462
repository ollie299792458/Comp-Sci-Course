Why would I give the worse science fiction film ever made two stars?  The answer is the fact that it is so incredibly, sickeningly, laughably, shamelessly and terribly awful that it deserves and extra star just because they still decided to send it to theaters.  I'm sure they knew of the excrement they had created beforehand.
Let me say before I begin bashing that I have absolutely nothing against scientology.  If rich Hollywood types want to throw money at a religion that requires no discipline in daily life, then fine.  Why do I mention Scientology?  The mastermind behind the source material for this dribble is none other than L. Ron Hubbard, or "Mr. Money Vacuum."  Supposedly, this film is supposed to be littered with Scientological dogma, although I was too busy laughing my rear off to catch any of it.  This film is not a comedy, in case you're skimming.
The basic plot of this film is that the Earth was taken over in a few minutes by some aliens, and the human race is reverted back to a bunch of Cro-Magnon slugs.  I guess they wiped out all our culture and subsequent generations just came out dumb.  I really don't care.  Anyway, the alien race enslaves mankind, and there's a lone man who dares oppose them (You won't see this coming, I swear).  In the stupidest plot development in the history of God's earth, the idiots he recruits spend a couple of hours in a flight simulator and are able to fly Harriers with deadly precision.  I wish I was making this up.
The ending is really inconsequential.  I don't want to remember it, and you won't either. If you find yourself wanting to donate money to a "church" in California, refrain and seek help immediately.  This movie is a plague upon mankind. If you buy this movie, you will be aiding the causes of John Travolta and Tom Cruise.  I think I've scared you enough.
Oh, and every performance in this movie is utterly terrible. IF you absolutely have to watch this movie, cleanse your eyes with some Star Wars afterwards.
