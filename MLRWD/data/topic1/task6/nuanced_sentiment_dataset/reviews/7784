I have been waiting for someone to get hold of the 35mm of this 1939 classic and do it justice. I have been privilaged to see an early disc of this edition and my kudos to North Hampton Partners and KOCH for creating the best looking Gulliver's to date. The colors look fantastic, the sound options from original to 5.1 Dolby sound fantastic. Simply put this was a big job, I am sure, and the result is Gulliver in size.

Produced by Fleischer in 1939 on a $1 million budget provided to them by Paramount Pictures, the film was created to compete with Walt Disney's Snow White and is, to this date, considered a feat in feature film animation history. Filled with songs, including "It's a Hap, Hap Happy Day" and "All's Well", Gulliver's is a delight to watch at any age.

Jonathan Swift's historic tale certainly comes to big life in this animated tale of a giant landing on the small island of Lilliput following a storm at sea. My favorite moment is right at the beginning when "Gabby" discovers the giant hand of Gulliver and begins counting fingers. (As and aside, there are two Gabby cartoons on this disc as well).

This edition was clearly put together with love and adoration and I will add it to my collection of classics the moment it comes out. It's reasing on Blu-ray as well, day and date.
