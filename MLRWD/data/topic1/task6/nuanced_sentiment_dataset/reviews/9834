WOW! I have just watched Once upon a time in Mexico for the second time in a row today!I rented it mainly because any movie with johnny depp in it intrests me as he is my fave actor. Boy was I not disappointed! Johnny was fantastic! Funny, sexy, scary, intresting....is there nothing he cnt do! Not only was Johnny Depp amazing but I found myself enthralled by the story and the whole legacy of El Mariachi. How cool is this film? I think cool is the word to describe this film as it doesn't take itself too seriously but still manages to be taken seriously. It's basically just fun all the way with intersting characters, fantastic shootouts and the coolest accessory eva. Who would have thought a guitar case could be so effective? I loved the music and how Banderas plays even in the middle of a shootout. Intersting fact did u know that Johnny Depp scored his own theme for Agent Sands called Sands theme? He plays the guitar himself.
For anyone in need of a thouraghly entertaining film watch this movie. It will get u talking about it for ages just like me.. I'm off to watch El Mariachi and Desperado now......
