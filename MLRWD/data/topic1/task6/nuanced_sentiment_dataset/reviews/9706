To put it simply..this movie didn't have just a real great plot.  At best, it was quite weak.  Most of the movie takes place inside of a serial killer's deranged, albeit very colorful mind.  Actually, the film reminded me a lot of Silence of the Lambs, except you don't really care about what happens to the characters; and Jennifer Lopez is no Jodie Foster.  
Actually in this movie, Ms. Lopez's character acts more like Little Bo Peep, or Goldie Locks.  She is just too sugary sweet. You want here to wake up and yell at someone. 
As for the visual aspects of the movie; the were awesome!  The costumes, the terrific use of color, and all of the sets were spectacular.  This will sound gross, but there is one really cool scene where a horse gets sliced like cheese between plates of glass.  But, it is alive and you can see its organs moving! Really gross, and doesn't mean much to the film, but really cool, in a sick sort of way.
Overall, I would buy it again....especially for the cheese slicer!
