This is no movie--it is real, unplanned, and very gripping. It brings back in vivid clarity the surreal heartbreak and anguish of that clear and moderately warm Tuesday in September. If I live to be a hundred years old, I will never forget 9/11/01. 9/11 is my generation's Pearl Harbor. This is a must see for everyone, as it is a first hand account of events plotted by unimaginably evil people and were witnessed by the firefighters of this movie who were at ground zero. Two classes of people in particular need to see this movie. One is schoolchildren, those currently in school and those yet unborn. The other is liberal politicians who are currently doing everything in their power to sabotage the war on terror and see their own country defeated in a war that can be won. Is there hope that after seeing this, our own enemy from within, liberal politicians--Hillary Clinton, et.al.--will maybe rethink their priorities and stop their treasonous behavior? Anyway, this is certainly a documentary to keep for the accurate historical record of that awful day that it is.
