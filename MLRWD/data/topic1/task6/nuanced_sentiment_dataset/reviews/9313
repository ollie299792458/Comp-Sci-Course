I suppose as a 'teen' movie, and in comparison to other teen movies, Cruel Intentions could be seen as a 4 star flick, especially when you consider the above average acting of it's a-list cast.
Cruel Intentions, however didn't do anything except bore me. Obviously the actors cannot be blamed. The plot and direction (or lack thereof) is what seriously stunts this film. This is an R-rated movie. Why it was dumbed-down to the degree that it was baffles me. Cruel Intentions could have been far more vindictive, sexual, and ultimately more entertaining (and given the ending much more weight in any event), if the director had spun it in a more coherent way.
Alas, this movie falls completely flat on it's face. I found it neither funny, romantic or engaging - or naughty enough to keep me interested. The only good swing in this movie is that in the end, both characters get what they deserve. There are a lot of things that could be made into a movie. Why this book was ever made into a movie I'll never know.
