I am not the biggest comic book fan, but I am a fan! I cannot tell you exactly how The Punisher lost his family in the comics, but I can tell you that this film from 2004 is the best Punisher to date! I am thrilled that the extended cut is now on gorgeous Blu-Ray. this extended version tells the story in fine fashion, even adding good humor and a side story about Castle's former partner who gave him up! This all stays with a steady pace. Instead of going off in a half-cocked rampage, Thomas Jane plays the disturbed anti-hero with calculative cool. Not rushing in, but stalking his prey and putting blood in the water, so his enemies might destroy themselves. Not to be out done in the physical department, Jane kicks major ass with the best of them! Little surprises also pepper the film, like Jane's comical, yet torturous fight with a giant russian, or the song that is performed by an assassin who plans to kill him. All of the actors, such as Rebecca Romjn and John Travolta do a fine job at their respective parts and the mobster style soundtrack works well to complete the piece. Buy this! Also check out Thomas jane's short film, "Dirty Laundry," on youtube, where he shows an obvious desire to reprise The Punisher role!
