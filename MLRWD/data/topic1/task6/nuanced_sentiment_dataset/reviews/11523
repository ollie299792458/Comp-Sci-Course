I know a lot of people don't like Season 6. And it is true that it wasn't as stellar a season as the previous ones. If you look at it for what it is, it's still a good season of a great show...it's still better than most shows on tv. It's still as awkward and clever as it ever was...it just lost it's mojo. A big problem that this season suffered from were plots that came in and finished too quickly. I would've liked to have seen more about the failing Dunder Mifflin or more of Jim as Co-manager. More of Michael dating Pam's mom, more of Michael dating that bartender. I felt like as soon as I started enjoying something it was over.

Standout episodes are:
The Meeting
The Promotion
Niagara
Koi Pond
Murder
Shareholder Meeting
Secret Santa
Sabre
Manager and Salesman
The Delivery
Happy Hour
Secretary's Day

***BE AWARE though. The Halloween cold open on Koi Pond is missing. I expect some kind of supplemental disc from NBC or Universal, because it's listed on the package. And if it's listed on the description it should be in there.***
