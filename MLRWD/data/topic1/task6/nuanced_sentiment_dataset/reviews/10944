I'll be honest, after the first few minutes of the movie I was bracing myself for a clunker filled with nothing but crude jokes, nudity and foul language attempting to divert my attention from a weak plot and bad acting. About 30 minutes in I found myself actually paying attention to what was going on and laughing at the humor...albeit juvenile.

Most movies in this category can all be summed up the same. Weak plot combined with a few naked women, dirty jokes and foul language. Not much else. Yes, Hot Tub Time Machine has all this but it wasn't overwhelming to the point that it took over the movie.  All 4 of the main actors had their own personalitlies that clashed, but yet played off each other. The movies stayed on the plot, blended in the vulgarity well IMO and had a decent, but predictable end.

I said before that there is foul language and crude jokes, but don't take that lightly. It is very adult humor. It's rated R for a reason.

This isn't Jackass, nor is it anything you'll confuse with an award-winning comedy, but if you enjoy movies like The Hangover, Hot Tub Time Machine is right up your alley.
