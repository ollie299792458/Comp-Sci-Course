I bought this set after watching Haeckel's Tale's on Syfy one night because I was so impressed with the episode. I love and always will love HBO's "Tales from the Crypt"  and I loathe the campy "Tales from the Darkside" series that is about as dark as the "Amazing Stories" series. So that is my personal aesthetic.

Yet after watching the full first season of Masters of Horror, I was completely let down. There are only a few noteworthy episodes in the season, and Haeckel's Tale is the best. I will however give it a star for exposing so many beautiful women's breasts, and it occurs in every episode.

"Dance of the Dead" sounds like an exciting title and Tobe Hooper is a good director, at least for the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but this episode is god awful.

"Homecoming" is thoughtful in a very lame self-evident sense, but brings terrible terrible shame to the zombie genre.

"Deer Woman" is slightly funny, and the actress is amazingly hot, but the episode was a complete turd!

"Pick Me Up" sounds interesting from the description, but not as clever and original as the description makes it sound, another failure.

"Dreams in the Witch-House" is a decent one. Yet I do not think it is inspired by a Lovecraft short story - I believe the original story was written by a member of the Lovecraftian Circle named Henry Kuttner and the tale was "The Salem Horror."

"Incident on and off a Mountain Road" is very similar to the film "The Hills have Eyes 2," yet incredibly (if possible) isn't as good as said film - the film is Ed Wood bad, but will never inspire a cult following.

Jenifer is one I like, and funny considering Steven Weber from the sitcom "Wings" once again stars in a horror tale where he makes sweet love to a ghoul. The first time being in Tales From the Crypt episode "Mournin' Mess" in 1991.
