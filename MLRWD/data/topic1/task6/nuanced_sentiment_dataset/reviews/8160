This guy talks about how Christians need to stop being so judgemental and stuff. We really SHOULD act like Jesus, call ourselves Christ-like to remind us to be Christ-like. It had a great message at heart.
but the reality is that Christians will NEVER stop being judgemental and filling people up with fear as long as there is a way of salvation to claim for their own.
this is the ONLY reason.
Christians are afraid that all these people are going to go to hell if they don't stop doing what they are doing and 'believe' in Jesus Christ as atoning lamb of God. They are all DREADFULLY afraid of their own God! (fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. ya right!)They wouldn't care at all if people had a homosexual life syle if they weren't afraid that God was going to torture them in HELL FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER! Deep down, they really DON'T care about your homosexual, lifestyle. But they act like they do because their big bad God does. The gospel as we know it today is terribly narrow and doesn't make any sense at all. some of it really is rather attractive. you get a free ticket to heaven if you only 'believe' in Jesus. whatever that means. who the hell knows, really.

Christians will never stop. Same with the Muslims. THEY all think you're going to Hell too! How come the Jews seem so friendly? And the Hindus, and Buddhists, and the freakin' Atheists?! Because they arn't afraid of God punishing you because of a 'belief' you hold, or who you hold at the end of the day.

no joke.
