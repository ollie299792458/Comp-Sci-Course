I thought that this movie was very factual and informing.  I did get alot of information from the movie about Buddhism and the Indian way of life.  I thought that the information that was given was helpful even though at times hard to follow. I think its definetly one of those "watch twice" movies.  All the story lines were too confusing to understand.  I finally fiugred out how to follow the movie.
The acting was surprisingly very good.  The "chosen " children were exceptionally great actors for their particular age.  I also thought that the foreign poeple in the movie were good actors.  They really made the movie have a  more realistic value. They made the movie different from other  Kong Fu movies featuring foreigners that you can't understand a thing they are saying.  These actors had a good English background as well as a Buddhist background.
The music was very realistic as well, and it made the movie come together.  Although, in some parts I think there was room for improvement, the whole production was truly helpful and interesting.  I cannot say I would have gone to rent or to purchase this movie myself, but as a class activity and since we are studying this subject, I really did not mind at all.
My favorite part would have had been at the end when the "chosen" children let the ashes go.  I thought it was interesting to see each child distribute the ashes in their own way.  It was neat how the little girl lets hers go at the top of the tree with all the monkeys.  It reminded me of "The Lion King"!  
Overall, I think the movie was a great production.  I would recommend anyone to watch this movie if they are studying Buddhism.  It will help you to understand how different religions can be.  Our religion will really seem quite different after viewing this movie.  I have a much better idea of how things looked at those times and the rules and regulations put on a certain person.
