When I first seen Return of the Living Dead back in 1985, I loved it! It was the best zombie movie I have ever seen. It was serious, but funny too...and most of all the gooooore...hehe. I still have the original video and when I heard it was coming to DVD...I nearly .... my pants! Thank you..it's FINALLY coming out! Today is August 27th and I went and bought my copy of it. I got home, closed the shades and began the movie. When the movie was over, I felt a little disappointed :o(  Don't get me wrong. The picture quality is better and some of the extra features are nice too...but they re-did some stuff in the movie I wasn't happy with. First in one scene...they completly changed the music that is playing during that scene. Next, there were a couple scenes that were suppossed to have music...but didn't. Finally, the most important thing of all...they changed Tarman's voice! I was in shock that they did this stuff to this great movie. They should have left it as it was. But still, if you can get passed those little changes...it is still a good movie. Thank goodness though that I still have the original..hehe.
