The Rambo movies are great. I just finished watching them for the first time, and they are very entertaining, solid movies. However, this DVD release looks like it was just slapped together.

First, there are no subtitles of any sort in any of the three films. These would be especially helpful, as Rambo isn't exactly the king of enunciation. Some of the dialogue is very hard to understand, even after backing up repeatedly.

The vaunted "Survival Mode" isn't that great either. The only good feature is the "MetaScope," which gives background to aspects of the film, such as foreign cultures and Rambo's equipment. All the other "Meta-" enhancements are extremely dull.

The bonus features consist of audio commentaries and deletetd scenes. The deleted scenes are pretty interesting, but of poor visual quality. I haven't listened to the commentaries.

I tried to watch these on my computer, and while it worked somewhat, there were problems. The discs lock up your computer for about 30 seconds just to ask whether to install extra features or play normally. The first two movies worked, but Rambo III crashed Windows Media Player and then, when I tried a second time, played the movie like it was some sort of slide show - a motion picture without the motion.

I watched Rambo III on a set-top DVD player after that, and it mostly worked; at 58:49, though, the movie freezes for a few seconds, then skips those few seconds. The DVD player also made weird, loud mechanical noises during this time. This sort of thing shouldn't happen with DVDs.

This set wasn't put together very well, from the simple three-DVD-cases-in-a-box packaging to the playback problems to the lackluster features and bonus materials.
