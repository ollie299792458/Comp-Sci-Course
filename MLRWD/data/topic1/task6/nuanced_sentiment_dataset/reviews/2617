B-movie horror actress/hottie Cerina Vincent stars in this low budget flick as a ranger who spends most of her days drinking herself to the point of passing out, in hopes of drowning her sorrows after being responsible for the death of her best friend. As if matters could'nt get any worse ,she comes across an acient creature that was once thought to only be a Native American legend, and being alone in the outpost, her survival instincts kick in when she realizes that she has only herself to take it on. Most of the movie is pretty much a bore, mostly since all our lead does is drink and whine about her problems. At one point a male counterpart steps into the picture only to offer a shpulder to cry on and some sexin it up.Throughout the movie we'd get a kill her and there, but the action does'nt really pick up until towards the end when our heroine the beast. When the creature was fully shown it reminded me of the monsterfrom Split Second an underrated film starring Rutger Hauer. By the look of the creature, you would'nt have gussed it was a low budget flick, because instead of a cheap costume or fake looking CGI, we're given a cool looking monster that can equal to something seen on a big screen production. The cinematography isn't bad and I have give credit that they really  tried to pass this off as an above average DVD feature, relying mostly on performances and a story than blood and guts. We don't get a lot of on screen deaths,but we're at least treated to some decent look corpses. Aside from the annoying whining and rants from the heroine, the film is fairly decentin parts, especially when it came down to the creature. However, don't expect a lot of action until towards the end.
