I had a bad feeling about this remake when I saw that they cast Liz Hurley as the Devil.  True to form, this is a classic example of the Hollywood belief that a hot bit of eye-candy will distract the audience from the bad writing long enough to make a pile of cash.  Poor Brendan Fraser.  He deserves a better script than this.  
The jokes are predictable, the plot is thin, Fraser's character is moronic instead of sympathetic (Hollywood seems to think that "ordinary guy" is synonymous with "idiot"), and the few minutes of fortune cookie philosophy thrown in near the end feels like an afterthought from somebody who never gave the afterlife much thought.
There is a reason why the movie industry relies so heavily on remakes of old movies and television shows these days.  It is obvious they have run out of ideas, and all the good writers have abandoned ship.  And if movie makers want people to judge their work on it's own merits, they should do their own work and quit scamming off the creativity of others, although this movie would be bad even if we didn't have the gem from Peter Cook and Dudley Moore to compare it with.
