The Pros:

 - If you play MMORPGs, it's definitely an entwining, relevant story.

 - If you don't play MMORPG's, you can still catch enough information to let you understand what is going on for the most part.

 - Beautiful music, especially Yuki Kajiura's "Key of the Twilight."

 - Interesting enough storyline.

 - Those Grunties are so darn cute.

 - Good price, now that it has gone down significantly due to its age, other .hack series releasing, and popularity.

The Cons:

 - The drawing style wasn't the best I've seen.

 - They often use music inappropriate to the scene, which can ruin the mood (like playing "Key of the Twilight" during a fight scene).

 - If you don't play video games or have never played an MMORPG, there is a lot of information you probably won't understand, like why some of the players have the roles that they do.

 - You have to play the video games to see the complete ending. I personally have all of the games but not everyone does.
