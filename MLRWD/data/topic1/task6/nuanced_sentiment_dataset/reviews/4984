This show was very good until the writers decided to have Carrie's bi-polar disorder discovered by her CIA bosses. That revelation gets her kicked out of the agency at the end of season 1 yet somehow she's sent by those same CIA directors to the Middle East to get information from a woman on the agency's behalf at the start of season 2. Do the creators of this show really think the viewers are that stupid? Maybe some people overlook that plot killer, but this is being called one of the best show's on TV and the truth us it's not even close to that. She also had numerous classified documents in her possession at her home and she gets in no trouble at all? Need I go on? How this show beat out Breaking Bad, Mad Men, or Boardwalk Empire in ANY Emmy category is pathetic. I can't believe I gave season 2 a try last night, but when the CIA came to her home to recruit her (not as a CIA agent) to go back and get info for them about an imminent attack, that was it, I had to turn it off. If anyone deserved to be nominated for an Emmy it was Mandy Patinkin, but as good as he was in all of season 1 it would have just been a nomination since both Aaron Paul and Giancarlo Esposito deserved to win for Breaking Bad (still the best show that's currently on TV). Hey writers, here's an idea...keep the disorder that once discovered kills the character's believability going forward for the show's finale (at least until the last few episodes). That's writing 101.
