"Director  and Leading Man" George Clooney Paints by the numbers in the period gridiron classic. What is good is that the detail, color and impeccable; so we know that George knows how to paint within the lines, but that is all. The charactors are given limited redemption, and the story is less than compelling in it's development. George borrows from the wonderful Coen brothers in style and from in the excellent "Oh Brother Were Art Thou". George feels also he must use token African Armericans in roles that are historically incorrect. This is not a bad thing from an inculsion standpoint, but it shows a knee jerk reaction of a Hollywierd Liberal attempting to redefine history and keep the film from being an all white folks affair. The tallented and beautiful Renee Zellweger models her role leaning somewhat on Jennifer Jason Leigh's fast talkin street smart gal reporter in the Hudsucker Proxy. Even one of her potential love interests resembles Tim Robbins charactor in the Hudsucker Proxy... Clooney has a wonderful tallent for comedy. He has wonderful repoire with the other actors. I feel Mr. Clooney is best served sticking to acting as his primary craft. He should dable less in directing and politics. I don't care for either one of them when he is involved. Overall I say that this is an ok  way to pass a rainy night. I don't suggest buying this film unless you are a diehard Clooney fan. I borrowed mine from the library and feel vindicated. I originally wanted to see this film in the theather, but did not. I didn't miss anything. I also recommend George Clooney in "Oh Brother Where Art Thou", and "Intolerable Cruelty". He is very entertaining in both of these Coen Brothers films.
