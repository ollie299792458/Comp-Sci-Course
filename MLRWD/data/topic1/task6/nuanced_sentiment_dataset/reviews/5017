This is vandalism.  All of Theseus's great speeches--the ones that state the play's themes, like his gorgeous description of his hounds--are cut.  Theseus himself is portrayed as a uxorious weakling, without wisdom or  will. Even his pardon of the lovers appears to be granted only at  Hippolyta's insistence. David Strathairn as Theseus has the look of someone  who's mostly thinking about something else--maybe what color upholstery to  get in his new Mercedes.  There is no Theseus here, so there is no grace or  justice in the world of the play.
All of the beautiful symmetry, the  harmony of opposites, the triumphant insistence on the redemptive and  creative power of the loving imagination is ignored or destroyed.  Instead  we get naked mud wrestling (I'm not making this up), a lot of long, loving  closeups of Rupert Everett looking wistful as Oberon, and a soundtrack  composed of every Italian opera chestnut the producers could remember  liking when they heard them in the original commercials.
I thought  Calista Flockhart was quite good in the difficult role of Helena.  
But  the film is vile.
