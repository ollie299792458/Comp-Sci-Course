I understand that a lot of today's action films feature a numerous amount of scenes that can only be achieved with the use of wires, but at least they attempt too hide it.  "Romeo Must Die" has to be one of the worst movies to ever use a wire.  The characters can often be seen holding on to a mysterious, invisible force that has the ability to control their movements and keep them in continual levitation.  THEY USED COMPUTERS TO GET RID OF THE WIRES, BUT THEY DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO HIDE THE GRIPPING HANDS!

Example: In the football scene, Jet Lee can easily be seen having his hands positioned over his head holding tightly on to what would be 2 wires.  He is also seen to effortlessly glide forward throwing kick after kick only to stop in mid air and softly land.

Example 2:  In one of the beginning night club fighting scenes, something happens that I would find embarrassing to put my name to.  A man is standing with his arms placed comfortably behind his back.  When he is attacked, the camera cuts to a different angel where he has a hand over his head "holding a wire". He proceeds to spin around at a horizontal angel to kick a guy, and then he effortlessly spins back around to kick someone else.

The movie is full of stupid crap like this.

In addition, the acting is bad, the story is flawed and uninteresting, and the action is questionable.  The entire movie seems as if it was set up to sell a terrible CD.  If I have to hear "Try Again" by Aaliyah one more time, I am going to give up out of spite.

I don't know what to say.  Buy a better movie.  Don't even consider this if you are looking for a good fighting flick.
