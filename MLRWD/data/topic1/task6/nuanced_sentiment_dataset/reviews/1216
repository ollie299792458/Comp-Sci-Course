The story of Jean Michelle Basquiat is probably pretty typical of a NYC artist during the period when Andy Warhol was famous for being famous. It touches lightly on the idea of art being a commodity and important only if "the right people" think it's important but nothing is concentrated on enough to make this anything more than a mediocre film. Not the art scene at the time,not the artists, not Basquiat's relationships and certainly no insight into his art. Actually, that's probably better left unknown. It has some historical merit but alot of the characters seem cliche even though they are supposed to be real people. And, I'm not sure what movie alot of reviewers were watching but David Bowie as Andy Warhol is atrocious. He is completely unbelievable and does what looks like Bowie might have done if he was trying to imitate Warhol for some friends.It's an unpolished one dimensional performance of a major character. The movie was of interest to me just to see what a "famous artist" was really like and how they became famous. Pretty standard though. More hype than talent.
