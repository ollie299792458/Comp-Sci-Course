I'm a huge fan of the first two Die Hard movies. It took me a while to get around to this installment, and now I wish I had never seen it at all. It starts off OK, but then it horribly falls apart with a completely unbelievable plot. Sure, the first two movies had unbelievable plot points, but they were just that plot points and easy to forgive because the overall premise of the films were not destroyed. That does not happen here. Just when you think you can start believing in the film again, it throws a ludicrous, unbelievable plot twist in. After a while, I lost my interest in the entire film. Jeromy Irons couldn't even save the film because he is matched with a twit of a partner in crime whose acting is so over the top it is beyond laughable and border on frustrating because the filmmakers are now just insulting the viewers. The chemistry between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson is electric, and that was the only reason I didn't hurl the DVD out the window and watched this pathetic movie until the end.
