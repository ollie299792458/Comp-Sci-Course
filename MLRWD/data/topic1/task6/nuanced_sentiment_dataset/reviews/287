T3 has fine performances by Claire Danes (fiery and feisty) and Kristanna Loken (cool and crafty).  Nick Stahl and Arnold Schwarzenegger give performances which are decent, but not as engaging.  
I liked the fact that the terminatrix used her sex appeal as an aid in infiltration.  Before seeing the movie, I had thought that a female terminator didn't make much sense (except to get a male audience).  But now I see that the less threatening, and more sexy, a terminator looks, the more able it is to achieve its goals.  Kristanna was every bit as good as Arnold was in the first film.
This is no James Cameron film.  The cinematography isn't as engaging (the point-the-camera-at-the-action school), and there are so many special effects that it almost takes away from the story.  The story wins out though, and that, along with the women's performances, saves the film.
The film was clearly influenced by The Matrix, particularly in a scene where T1 and TX fight it out, busting through loads of porcelain in a restroom.  Reminded me of Morpheus and that unfortunate toilet bowl.
While I doubt the possibility of another sequel, the film leaves room for one, or even a TV series.  Stunt direction is very impressive.  The film keeps moving, and doesn't grow tiresome -- and it has an ending which is indeed consistent with the other films.  If it didn't, then there would be no ugly future for the terminators to have come from!
So, while this film isn't as great as the other two, it isn't an insult to its legacy.  It holds up.
