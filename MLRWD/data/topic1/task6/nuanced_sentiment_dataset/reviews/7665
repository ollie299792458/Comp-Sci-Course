Not a terrible movie.  Not great either.  Kinda in the middle in a so so sorta way.  It is gory but not over the top like the Saw movies.  Also there is no nudity.  For a horror movie it is decent in these areas by not going over the top & being above and beyond disgusting & showing nothing but T & A.  There is minor drug use.
The story line reminded me of an episode of Ghost Hunters where they go to the penitentiary.  These smarty pants military techs who are way young decide to play combat simulated gaming that is unauthorized in an old prison.  Things get crazy there's ghosts... & that's all I'll say so I don't ruin it for you.
Some of the acting is a little weak but other actors seem to pull their weight.  The evil character is not overly scary & this characters method of killing is odd & not all that believable to me.
If you are looking for something to entertain you & spook you a little that doesn't require a whole lot of brain power or attention on your part then you will most likely enjoy it!  If you are looking for a deep movie that you cannot tear your eyes off for a second because you might miss something critical while you try to solve what the scare your pants off thing is & how to fix it, then you should not watch this movie!
Hope that helps you decide.  :o)
