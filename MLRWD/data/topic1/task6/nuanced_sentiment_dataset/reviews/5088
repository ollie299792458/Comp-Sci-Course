How can anyone think this movie is good??  You can see the wires she is using from 10 miles away, they don't bother to tell you anything about her homeworld except that they are in inner space, which of course means they live under water (Huh??).  Can someone tell me how she knew her cousins' name was Clark Kent?? Did Superman send the family notes or something??  This second rate witch (played appalling by Faye Dunaway) get her hands on a power source that will let her do anything and she has to use a truck to get some gardener? And why was she so desperate to get this guy to fall in love with her in the first place?? All these questions add up to one God awful movie. I have no idea how anyone could read this script and think any good could come out of it.  The story is silly, the acting is probably the worst I have seen since porno, the effects make me long for Ed Wood.  The fact that they made a 2 disc set for this film and other, more worthy films don't get that kind of treatment makes me believe that satan does run Hollywood.
