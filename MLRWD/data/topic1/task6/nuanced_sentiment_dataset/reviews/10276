I wish you could give LESS than one star, because this dog deserves it. What an awful, painful movie this is to watch. The main characters are hateful -- I wanted to kill them myself, and had absolutely no sympathy for them at all. They bicker and complain at each other for the first hour and ten minutes before the wife finally is silenced. It was like being forced to sit through couples therapy with two people who hated each other. The husband --  who was almost tolerable -- then turns all Vietnam-flashback crazy. The corn kids were creepy, but terrible actors. The little scripture-spouting prophet was the worst, and sounded like he was reading lines he didn't even understand. I truly had to force myself to watch this horrible thing all the way through. Not again. I like the original, and although this version perports to be closer to King's original story (which I read long ago, but don't remember well enough to say if this is true or not -- I certainly don't remember hating the protagnonists as much as I hated the two main characters in this movie!), it was truly and deeply unlikable on many levels. SyFy needs to quit making movies, as they've never once made anything that was even remotely decent.
