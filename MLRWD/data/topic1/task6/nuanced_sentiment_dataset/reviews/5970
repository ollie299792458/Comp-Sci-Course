This DVD is a worthwhile supplement to The Watchmen feature film. I feel that the Under the Hood short will entertain fans of the film more than the Black Freighter animated short.

My issues with the Black Freighter feature may lie with its format. Instead of being interwoven with the main story arc, as it is in the graphic novel, we are viewing it in its entirety here. As a result, I feel that we lose some of the suspense and foreboding, that for me came with being fed the narrative in pieces. As, I have read, that this story is first and foremost allegory to the main narrative, and therein might lie the problem. As a stand alone story, it is entertaining, but unspectacular. But, when we inevitably (hopefully) get the deluxe edition of the film, with all elements once again interwoven, it will be interesting to see what effect this has on each of the stories.

The animation is beautiful and brutal. Gerard Butler's performance is solid, but like his performance in RocknRolla, his performance seems to hit the ceiling early, and stay there. My exposure to Butler is limited to 300, RocknRolla, and Tales. I haven't really felt any complexity to his performances. In 300, he nailed the character, but his other two performance seem to fill a role more then elevate the character.

I think the Under the Hood feature is superior, and hits he right vibe of the source material. It left me wanting more. The Black Freighter left me wanting more, but only because I thought it simply needed more in order to build the tension and help sell the main character's descent into madness.
