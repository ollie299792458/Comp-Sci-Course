First of all, simply from an artistic point of view this movie does not deserve 5 stars (save special effects, which score ten across the board).  The plot is simple and honestly at times illogical.  Please do not try to reason the movie and just accept it as a form of entertainment.  It's worth it.  Aside from bringing to public's attention, the environmental problems during an election year, the Day After Tomorrow is a satire worth your attention and my $9.50!  IT IS FUNNY!  It engages the audience:  will they make it?  will she live?  is that really Dick Cheney?, and so on.  
At its proper moments, the movie hits home with a realization, that maybe we are not as immune as we thought, maybe the environmental disasters will happen in our time (unless we enact laws to protect ourselves, ourchildren, unless we do it today).  Yes, the movie is an overdramatization solely for the entertainment and profit value, but it is based on dry reports of scientists worldwide, all of which seem to say:  Hi there!  Cause and effect, you do this-this is what happens next.
