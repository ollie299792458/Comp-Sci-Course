Laughed harder at this movie than most others I've seen. Ran across & watched it for the first time during a mini-marathon rebroadcast on TBS. Contrary to some reviewers I thought that Carrey's comic instincts were right on track & very well-moderated.  He even pulled off a few poignant moments as a dramatic actor in the film, conveying both the tragedy & dark comedy around loss of job, prestige & all things attached, as well as the extremes in behavior which that can lead people to.  Carrey & Tea Leoni mesh well together as the husband & wife, supporting each other through improbable choices, during an improbable time.  Even during the most madcap moments of the film they manage to convey a delightful warmth as partners which is refreshing to see in an onscreen marriage.  Their concern for each other during every laugh of the film lends credibility to the incredible.  Tea Leoni earns profs here as a comedic actor in her own right.  This is a truly entertaining comedy, which to its unlikely credit also arouses some reflection.
