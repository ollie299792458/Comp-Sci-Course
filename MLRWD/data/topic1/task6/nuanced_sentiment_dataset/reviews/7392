First off, A NO STAR rating for this crap! Mrs. Curtis a.k.a. Jamie Lee came back on this ego trip to exorcise her so-called type casting. Her  self-serving influence reeks in this terrible plot. For someone who echos  Halloween made her career possible, she seems awfully resentful of her  Halloween past. Calling out Michael and then conveniently has him at her  mercy to behead him. What a joke, who wrote this excrement? If not for  Myers presence, this would have taken the title from Halloween III as the  worst. The teen, garbage actors are a disgrace. They would have been better  off casting mannequins. Is ll cool j (or what ever he calls himself) an  actor? He's not even a musician. But, that's another story. As long as we  pump the money into these inferior works, Hollywood will continue to  produce such crap. Like, Halloween III, this one is forgotten. Turn the  page. Save your money for the release of H2K. Hopefully, they'll get it  right this time. Another example of how bad the industry has become.
