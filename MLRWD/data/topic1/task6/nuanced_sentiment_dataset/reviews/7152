First I want to thank the M80 Dawn of the Dead team for my early copy. Every fan should buy this set today! The Dawn of the Dead Ultimate set is awesome for any George Romero fans. This 4 Disc set in widescreen format contains hours of zombie watching. The box is done in black and the inserts were nice.  On the first disc you get to see the Dawn of the Dead we saw in theaters. There are also cool commentaries and trailers which I missed the first time it came out. There's some interesting stuff with a gallery thing they had showing a comic preview and some stuff about Romero. There is also some other stuff on the first disc that I didn't get to yet but I will. The second disc has the extended stuff which made it so worth getting the set for me. It's not like seeing a new movie but it was nice. There is some commentary by the producer in this one and some more gallery stuff with prodction stills and etc. The third disc contains the European Version which was shorter than the U.S. version we all saw, or at least the one I saw and loved. At this point of watching the dvd set I was turing into a zombie myself. A happy zombie I point out. The most interesting things on this disc were the UK tv ad for the film and the commentaries. There was some more gallery stuff which I still haven't yet watched because I wanted to save a little something for later. The fourth disc contains featurette Monroeville Mall tour with George Romero on set home movies with commentary from Robert Langer, document of the dead and the dead will walk. The video quality and audio quality throughout this film was amazing. I can't believe they did such a good job with the tranfer. There are a nice amount of extras to make most fans happy. Unlease the zombie in you and get this set says the cookie. If you haven't seen this film before you might want to rent it first but not fans.
