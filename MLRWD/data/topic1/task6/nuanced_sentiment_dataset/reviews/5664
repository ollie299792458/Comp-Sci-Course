I rented this movie because I am a fan of romantic comedies and this looked good from the box. I was wrong. I watched about half of it even though the first half was really clunky and poorly written. None of the actors say their lines with ANY feeling whatsoever. Debra Messing looks really old, pale and too thin. Her acting is poor and it looks like she has never been on a stage before. Dermot Mulrooney plays a sarcastic gigolo she hires to makes her ex jealous at her sister's wedding. But then she freaks out when her ex seems to like her still. I stopped watching after she slept with the gigolo and pretended like she didn't remember. He was already acting like he was in love with her. Please! If he was a real gigolo he is not going to fall in love with her just because they slept together or that she kissed him at some bar! It was really unbelievable. Even though I didn't watch anymore after the that, I can predict the rest of the plot.....she pretends like she doesn't like him, he likes her, then her ex wants her back and she think she wants him, but she actually wants the other guy. It's been done to death! But it was done in a hundred other movies by much better actors and with much better supporting characters. Save your money!!!
