Who can resist that title?  This film has so much MST3K riff potential that it could have been written for them. A "roots of teen crime" premise (I was abused as a zygote), a weenie male lead, a hair-helmeted B-movie queen, innumerable too-easy booze references, fast-talking (as in auctioneering) mafiosos--just about anything you care to hyphenate can be found in abundance in this classic tale of a boy who is born, wins an essay contest, falls in love, unknowingly turns to a life of crime, commits murder and in the end (beginning) fingers mom and dad.I envision the Best Brains ensemble sitting around the writers couch going "What DON'T we joke about?".  The film just seems to be made for them.  A semi-musical b/w gift from the B-movie gods.  What is most disturbing is that which lies beneath the quips, the underlying vibe of it all.
First of all the sketches, from first to last, build upon one another to a crescendo of psychoanalytic "huh?".  Rooted in a self-conscious probe into male sexuality (naked Tom Servo) and bisexuality (Cake-N-Shake), the sketches continue on through alternative family structure and a chalk talk/baby mobile view of Jimmy's mind before going for the REAL throat--the Hamburger Guy.  Is he God or just your uncle's weird friend?  Or both?  Insert willies here.
Anyway, all that was just a bunch of made-up crap.  Enjoy this version of I Accuse My Parents because you should.  And I will.
