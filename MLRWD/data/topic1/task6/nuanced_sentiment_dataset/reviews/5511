After watching the first 10 minutes there is at least two dozens deaths (animated deaths but deaths none the less) and it just shocked me how can a movie like this be rated G. Which demographic are this people aiming to? A 1960's based spy movie? Are they serious? Of course people are going to say "Get a life. There's death and violence in the real world, kids should be prepared to accept death as natural part of life, blah blah blah". But what's the message in this movie? Bad people lose, good looking people win? That's the Disney motto, not Pixar's. This sequel does not compare to the Toy Story sequels if you're going to name other sequels made by Pixar.  The original plot was about character development, friendship, being humble, recognizing ones faults and growing up.  This movie is just an action movie not a family movie. I was disappointed to see that John Lasseter contributed to the story of this movie and it is a shame since this movie differs so much from the first one that one can only think that he was ordered to produce a sequel. Mr Lasseter, if you're not on the Board you just are an employee; forget whatever title they give.  If the movie does not sell you'll be held accountable and fired a second time from the same company. Seems that the winning streak of Pixar has ended. Better luck next time.

P.S.  "Planes?" How original. Another marketing tool.
