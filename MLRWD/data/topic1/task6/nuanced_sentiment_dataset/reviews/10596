The good news about this DVD (I got the DVD last week) is that it emphasizes the "new" old songs performed on the tour ("I'll Follow the Sun," "Please Please Me," etc.) and relegates the oft-repeated "Hey Jude" and "Let it Be" to background music. The bad news is that once again each shot of the band lasts only a couple of seconds. Would someone please send Paul a copy of "The Concert for George" ... or even one of Ringo's concert DVDs ... so he can see how these things should be done?

And once again, there are far too many audience shots and too many talking heads telling us how great Paul and his music are. We know, Paul, we know. That's why we're buying the DVD; we don't need to be constantly reminded of it.

Still, it sounds great in 5.1.

3 stars for the overall presentation; an extra half star for the near complete absence of Heather Mills. (You see her in some fleeting shots, sort of the same way Cynthia Lennon was glimpsed in the background of The Beatles First US Visit footage). Also, I wonder how much influence she had in Linda McCartney being almost totally absent from the Wings footage shown prior to each concert? (The pre-concert film is included on the DVD).
