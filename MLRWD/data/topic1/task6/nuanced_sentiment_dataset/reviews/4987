This movie is a very pretty western and the lighting is fantastic. There are some scenes that remind one of classic wersterns, almost a tribute to them. This is an old story. Boy returns as a man to avenge his father's death. It is fairly implausible that a young boy could travel over a thousand miles to family after his father's death, especially with all the dangers of a pre civil war country.(And back, fifteen years later) I have read all of Larry Mc Murtry's sagas that almost scare one away from camping for heaven's sake. And Will Henry, that author makes the hundred years war seem a picnic in comparison. But this story has young love, the most miserable villian imaginable and a really great supporting cast of classic western actors that I enjoyed seeing. I hope this crew gets together again for another western with a more unique story. This was well done but it became a tad preachy in parts, remembering his father the slain minister. This cast is so good they can chew scenery anytime for me. The animals and gear were very authentic which really distracts me if I spot something out of place or continuity and they were good here with guns and horse gear.
