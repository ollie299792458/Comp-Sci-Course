I loved this movie! I have been a die-hard Godzilla fan since I was three or four. I was even Godzilla for Halloween people! Anyone who does not like this movie needs to consider what changes are needed sometimes for Hollywood even to accept this movie. This movie rocks out LOUD!!!!!!!!!!!
  So what if they changed Godzilla up. Now, don't get me wrong, believe me, I LOVE the old Japanese Godzilla movies, but in the old movies Godzilla looked like Frankenstein in a lizard's body! He was fat and slow. The new Godzilla is a sleek, fast predator, and, as a matter of fact, he DOES breathe his "fire" in this American remake.
  If you look closely when Nick and the others are being chased in the taxi, he actually breathes fire after them and destroys a car. Godzilla can actually climb buildings in this movie and can do what any reptile should be ABLE to do. If you really are a Godzilla fan, and don't mind change (unlike some freaks who still belive in the 50's)you will LOVE this movie.
