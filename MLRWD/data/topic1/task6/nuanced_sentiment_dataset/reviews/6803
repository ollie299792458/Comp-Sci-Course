I pre-ordered "Black Dynamite" back in September. I patiently waited to receive the disc which should have been released on 11/17/2009. You can imagine how P.O.'d I was to open my package from Amazon on 11/19/2009 to find I'd been shipped "Black Soul Dynamite" a 3 disc collection of marginal 70's/80's exploitation films instead! Evidently the DVD release has been pushed back until early 2010 with not specific date given as of yet.

Amazon's customer support explained their shipping error. However no explanation was given as to why customers who pre-ordered the "Black Dynamite" DVD were not informed of the change in the release date or why the original orders were not put on hold.  Anyone else have this experience? Two big thumbs down to Amazon's customer support for not being on point informing it's customers about the pre-order status for this title.

Update 02/17/2009: I've finally viewed the DVD (courtesy of Redbox). Very Funny film overall. No real complaints here.  However I was hoping that the DVD extras would be more extensive. It would have also have been nice to included the alternate cut of the film that's circulating on the net for some time now. A no-brainer purchase for those who enjoy the "Blacksploitation" genre this film is such a loving and hilarious homage to.
