While I do appreciate this film for at least having some very grand and unique visuals, I can't say the same for the actual plot.  Well, maybe not the plot itself, but the pacing.  This movie goes by WAY too fast.  I don't feel any real connection to Atreyu because the plot moves along to fast and doesn't pose any real threat to him until the very end.  First, after the horse that I didn't care about and is INCAPABLE of emotion died after sinking into the swamp of SADNESS, Atreyu looks pretty depressed, but does he, a human CAPABLE of emotion not sink to his death, well eventually he starts to sink, but why doesn't it happen right away?  Second, why did the film introduce us to the goblin, the rock-biter, and the...other guy, and spend so long establishing them if they have nothing to do with the movie at all.  Lastly, and this is just a personal gripe, who in all hell has been so scared by a book where they have actually screamed out loud.

"And all of a sudden, the head of a giant turtle popped out"...

AAAHHHHH!!!!!!!!

Holy s**t, that was absolutely terrifying.
