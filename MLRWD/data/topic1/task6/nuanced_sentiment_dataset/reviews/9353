Originally Retromedia was to release this uncut, with original colorized ending, and their disc would have had a ton of extra's including full lengnth commentary. According to Fred Olin Rays Message board (...), yes, you have to sign up to read posts.) the copywrite owner of the Flesh eaters sold the film first to MPI(under their new Dark Sky Films banner) and then sold it to F.O.Ray at Retromedia after that. After looking at the situation from a lawyers viewpoint, MPI had the right to release film to DVD, Not Retromedia. The fans have to suffer now because MPI have decided to not carry over (tho' F.O.Ray did offer the extra's to DarkSkyFilms)the extra's, the interviews and the audio-commentary. So, in essence this MPI DVD will be the "edited for TV" version shown on late night TV and once available on video in the 80's.
This is a true shame. This film in all its unedited glory is truely a gory, creepy, insane masterpeice of early 60's film making. Be on the look out on Ebay, Retromedia did send out about 50 "review copies" and some have turned up (about 3 months ago) on ebay. Come on Dark Sky Films, push the release date back and include all the flesh eating, I mean mouth watering extra's.
