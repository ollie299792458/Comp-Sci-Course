I have owned this fantastic documentary for a few years on VHS and have been watching for it to come out on DVD.  When I saw it available on Amazon, I immediately ordered it.  One, I was hoping for some additional material, which there is some on the DVD.  Also, I can now loan out my VHS copy without living in fear that it may not be returned.

Hoop Dreams is surely one of my five favorite films ever.  I am a big sports fan and would certainly recommend it to other fans, especially those fond of high school sports.  However, it is so much more a movie about kids and families trying to make it in tough situations.  As Roger Ebert stated in his praise of the film, it is one of the great movies ever about American life.

For those who have seen the movie already, the DVD bonus material includes the entire film with William's and Arthur's comments and thoughts over the top of it.  It has the numerous reviews from Siskel and Ebert.  Also included is a booklet with good information about the project and what has happened to the people involved since.

My DVD collection is much more complete with the addition of Hoop Dreams.
