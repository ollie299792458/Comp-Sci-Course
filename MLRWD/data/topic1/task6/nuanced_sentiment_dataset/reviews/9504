One day I bought "The Who live at Isle Of Wight 1970" in two audio cd, which includes the whole concert. I read in the booklet it was the soundtracks from a movie by Murray Lerner. So since then I was expecting to get it on film. As a Who fan I always long for a Who concert from their golden era 1969-1976. When this concert was released I was beyond excited. Then I was very dissapointed. Why?  well, half of the concert is what I expected, The WHO at their best (Heaven &amp; Hell, I can't explain, Water, Young Man blues, etc). Then the performance of Tommy and Oh My God, where is the director of this project??? I will cut him into pieces just like he did in here. I couldn't believe such a thing. If Tommy was not meant to be complete here, well, why including all the wee songs like "Do You Think It's Alright", "There's A Doctor" &amp; "Miracle Cure", and NOT includes "Amazing Journey" ????  My personal fave, but also one of the main songs in the rock-opera, where the story-line is told. Unreal. Songs like "Go to the Mirror" and "Eyesight to the Blind" are edited badly. Tommy ends up being a lot of non-sence wee songs.
There's also the movie "Isle Of Wight Festival" that includes all the artists who took part of that concert, and The Who are performing there "Naked Eye", which is NOT included in this video either.
The Who performance is FIVE, SEVEN, TEN, THIRTY-FOUR stars and more, but I take two stars away 'cos of the director of this project.
