i saw this movie on tv years ago and almost forgot about it until it resurfaced on dvd.  at the time i had no idea who russell crowe was, but i do remember that this movie really stuck with me to remember it so many years later.  this is a very unconventional movie, especially in the father son aspect.  you have a very loving father of a gay son.  this is not a typical relationship in the movies or in real life, but it really works.  this movie really tries to put acceptance at the core of this movie.  the father completely accepts who is son is and tries to support him in every way shape and form.  the movie sets up a nice contrast with a possible love interest with russell's character because the other character, greg, is not out to his parents, and when they find out his father threatens him and kicks him out of his home.  i really like the aspect of seeing both ends of the spectrum in this regard because it really shows the two poles of relationships between gay children and their parents.  another scene shows the father walking in on russell crowe and the character greg fixing to make out, while the father could care less, the character greg sprints from the couch shaking in fear.  this is the type of realness i like to see in a movie.  a movie not afraid to show the fear gay men feel in real life.  the story continues with the father trying to find love again and also showing flshbacks of crowe'slesbian grandmother.  this is the type of movie that genuinely tries to show the depth of love and devotion.  it also nicely portrays the longing gay men feel for a companion, and how they are capable of love just like anyone else.  this movie is so touching, wonderfully acted, and a nice gem to add to any collection.  i love this movie and highly recommend this movie to anyone.
