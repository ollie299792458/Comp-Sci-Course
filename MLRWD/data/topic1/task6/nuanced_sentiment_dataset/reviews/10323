Over The Hedge is a smart, laugh-out-loud funny cartoon about a group of animals trying to navigate through suburban life. A wry wink and nod to the audience flows throughout the movie as R.J. the raccoon comes across a group of hibernators who wake up to find themselves in the middle of a suburban development that popped up while they were sleeping.

The execution of the story is the most amazing part of the film as a simple hedge becomes a wall between two worlds for the small critters whose fear of the suburbs gradually turns into a non-stop quest to grab as much food as possible. The animals fish-out-water jump into the suburban landscape allows the script to poke fun at many all- -too-human failings, especially when it comes to the large amount of food we all seem to consistently consume.

I found myself literally crying at some scenes as the plot combined a nice combination of cartoon mayhem with adult whit. In particular Hammy the squirrell, voiced by Steve Carrell, added a nice Kramerish like touch of weirdness to the normal batch of cartoon characters to keep the movie from being stale.
