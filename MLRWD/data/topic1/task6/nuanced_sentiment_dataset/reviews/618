This movie was a stereo-typical Hollywood expose
of the problems with those who come back from Iraq.
It is anti-war and more typical of Hollywood than of
reality. The plot was symplistic and so PC you can
guess exactly how each plot sequence is going to work
(boring).  It ends up with a Jane Fonda / John Kerry
view of our troops as torturers and murderers.  Having
a son in the military I see this as simple American bashing
troop hate speech so typically the Hollywood elites who
seem to be more into America bashing propaganda than
finding out what is really going on in Iraq.  One story
is taken and blown up as if it is the norm.  Why is it
I never see any stories telling the wonderful things are
troops our doing in Iraq come out of Hollywood.  Monolithic,
1984 same-think with never a dissenting voice.  Really sad
that our troops daily put their lives on the line while
Hollywood rips up and smears our young men and women.
It ends with an upside down flag flying.  The folks in
Hollywood seem stuck in their old Vietnam anti-troop mode.
What a shame.  Don't waste your time on this movie. Just
another Jane Fonda American bashing Hollywood perversion
of reality hardly "cutting edge."  Stereo-typical and boring.
