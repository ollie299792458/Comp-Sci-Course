Will there ever be another year like 1984? this film is quite entertaining about a big city kid(Kevin Bacon) as Ren McCormick, who moves with his family to a small bible-belt community, & meets oppression every where he goes, & attracts the attention of the preacher's daughter played by Lori Singer, (V's Marc Singer's sister) who is a wild child to say the least & does not share her father's conservative values, the whole film is built on the community's oppression to dancing & Rock-n-Roll, the scary part is that there are still towns like this across the country, so this film is real in that respect, but it does scream 80's, it should be noted that MTV marketed this film big time, & it was one of the first films to capitalize on a soundtrack, with Prince's "Purple Rain" following just months later in 1984, since Michael Jackson's 1983 video "Thriller", MTV & Hollywood got in bed together & saw a marketing strategy that did for a time work, this film was perfect timing & still holds up well for its story, other films such as "Steets of Fire", "Ghostbusters", "Beverly Hills Cop", T.V."s "Miami Vice", all from 1984 capitalized on their movie soundtracks, MTV's videos became flashy, I don't think we will ever see another year like 1984, where movies & music became one, this one made Kevin Bacon a star & John Lithgow is very convincing as the Reverend who holds strongly to his convictions, although PG, I agree that it should have been PG-13 because of some of its content, Lori Singer's sexual antics as well as her & her boyfriend's violent breakup, but again this was released months before "Gremlins" & "Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom, also in 1984 that sparked the PG-13 rating, however this should not stop one's enjoyment of the film.
