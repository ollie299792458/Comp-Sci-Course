The entire time I was watching this movie, I couldn't help thinking, "What am I missing?" This critical darling is cute, but beyond predictable. There is no new ground broken here. Nick pines for his shallow ex-girlfriend while Nora stays with her shallow ex-boyfriend because it's comfortable. They are pushed together by Nick's friends (the only characters in the movie of any interest were the three gay friends) while they all search for a secret concert by their favorite band, Where's Fluffy.

Nick realizes the ex-girlfriend isn't as awesome as Nora, and the happy ending comes when they realize they'd rather spend time together than see Where's Fluffy. Yawn.

My one enduring memory of this movie won't be the performances or the story. It will be the ongoing "joke" where several characters share a piece of gum that has, amongst other things, ended up being fished out of a toilet at the Port Authority after one character has thrown up, and popped right back into her mouth.

If you are a teenager, this movie is right up your alley. Otherwise, you'll probably find it's better than the average teen fare, but you'd be better served by choosing a better movie in the genre (anything by John Hughes will do).
