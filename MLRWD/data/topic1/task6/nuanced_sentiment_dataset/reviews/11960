What I enjoy most is that the people that praise this movie most highly are the people that this movie is propaganda against.  Apart from the right wing son, these characters are right wing fantasies about what liberal people must be like.  For all that, they screw up the right wing son as well when the get into the technicalities of his profession (describing the mechanics of an interest rate swap when the son presumably trades commodity futures or some such derivative).  Note that each of the professors has tragic family problems while the trader finds the real meaning of love: responsibility.  The reason people run from American movies is the lack of subtlety.  Out of the frying pan . . .

The commentary concerning universal health care and labor unions is funny and for all I know, true, but I can't trust the information due to the clear bias.  Not that there's anything wrong with exploring the complexities of the libertarian philosophy in a work of fiction (many successful examples), but the real flaw with this movie is that there is no real complexity within it.
