I was aware that this new DVD was a "remake" of Dance Party and bought it anyway. I really don't blame them a bit for putting it out. Dance Party was made when they were still "unknowns". The sets were bargain basement and sometimes Anthony is wearing a green short-sleeved shirt and the Big Red Car is made of cardboard. Yes, they had the enthusiasm of being a new act and of being much younger in the earlier version but they have new audiences with every new crop of kids born each year. I think it is perfectly understandable that they want to do something a little more "polished".

For us, the Wiggles can do no wrong! We would buy a DVD of them clipping their toenails! We LOVE them in our household. They have brought our family tremendous joy over the past several years. We saw them in concert last fall and they were WONDERFUL! I will take them over the other saccharin children's performers and television shows any day. I have heard their songs 1,000 times and STILL like them. They saved us from having to endure Barney and his ilk.  Our son is always singing their songs, and dancing to the music, and playing with his Wiggles toys. He can't get enough of them.

No, this isn't our favorite of their productions but we like it anyway. We think they still have a sense of fun and loads of energy. We love the Wiggles and always will! Long Live the Wiggles!
