This movie isn't as bad or as good as most people reviewing it here are saying. Forget who's in it, forget your expectations, and this is a very average movie. The acting is solid, there are a few good plot twists (or not really twists since they never really got us seated in the plot in the first place), and it is relatively suspenseful.

Those are the positives. They're enough to make it worth a watch if your bored some night and there's nothing really good to watch.

The negatives are that unfortunately for a suspense thriller/drama it's actually kind of boring. I don't know why they chose to start the movie off with a birth, but it really did set the mood for the rest of the film. It would have been much more grabbing if they would have started it off showing some kid get taken, or just something to really bring the audience in to the darker aspect.

It's not all that we'll written and has some MAJOR plot issues *SPOILER alert*. Why did the radio turn on when the kid gets kidnapped from Biel's house? They couldn't have thought of some better way to get her to walk downstairs? Who turns a radio on when they're stealing a kid? Secondly, why the heck did the lady take biel with her in her vehicle when she knocked her out? Thirdly why the heck was the kid even staying in Biehls house? Are you telling me they had to bring him BACK to the crummy town to connect with the "tall man"?

Plot matters to me, so Im not crazy about this movie, but if you just want some suspense and twists it's probably a good movie for you.
