Due to the great success of "First Blood" fans demanded that Stallone grab his knife and bow and return for some action. "Rambo First Blood part 2" did deliver the action, but the story lacked after the increadible story that "First Blood" was.

"Rambo First Blood part 2" picks up right about where the first one leaves off. Rambo has been in prison for a while. The film opens with him chopping rocks. Col. Trautman comes to tell Rambo that there is some strong emotions invested in the pows left in Vietnam and they are looking for someone who can go into Vietnam and investigate. Rambo excepts this offer as it gets him out of prision and back to what he does best.
When Rambo meets the man in charge of this mission, he is not impressed due to his lack of interest in Vietnam, and his lack of knowledge about the topic.
When Rambo lands in Vietnam and finds the village he is supposed to take pictures of, he discovers the camp is not empty and in fact there are about a dozen pows. Rambo takes one of the pows to the extraction site and Murdock the man in charge orders an abort of the mission. Rambo is left in Vietnam.

Overall, Rambo part 2 fails to live up to the original "First Blood." The plot is not the best and the effort was focused too much on the action.
