This is a movie that had so much potential, but sort of squandered  it. It is enjoyable at times, and maybe not worth a purchase but a renting. I personally am glad I bought it just because of how big of a Vince Voughn fan I am. I found that he was funny as always in this film. But the real shock to me, and who stole the film was the rock. And that shocks me to say but he was great in this movie. And probably saved it. Now don't get me wrong I am not some wrestling freak, I actually hate wrestling. But the rock was so out of character in this film, and actually acted so well that he was the best part of the movie.

The problems with this movie are simple, so gay and so boring for huge stretches of time. The whole middle of the film is so boring and leaves you waiting to see vince vaughn and the rock again. But it picks up alittle near the end. It is really only funny from time to time. But overall it is not a bad film, it can be very enjoyable at times. Though those times can be limited.
