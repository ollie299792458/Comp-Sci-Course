First of all I have 5 Taebo Videos and have been doing Taebo for 5 months now.
1)Taebo Ripped Extreme
2)This Is Tae Bo
3)Taebo Cardio Explosion
4)Ultimate Taebo
5)Ultimate Bootcamp

Comparing Ultimate Taebo to #1, #2 and #3 it is not that great. I would Highly suggest #2 above all of them. I would then pick #3 then #1. I am leaving out Ultimate Bootcamp because it is not a cardio workout. That DvD is for building muscles and man does it ever. I won't write a review for it yet though.

I did sweat a good bit from this video but I wasn't nearly out of breath like I am from #2. Most of the moves you see on this DvD you will see on the 3 I recommend. It makes sense though since this DvD(Ultimate Taebo) came first. The workout is good but I found it lacking in intensity. If you want itensity go with #2 and #3. I didn't like the dance moves around the 50 minute mark of the video. I'm not a dancer. If I wanted to dance I would buy Zumba. I want a kickass kick and punch video and didnt get it from Ultimate Taebo. Again #2 and #3 much better. I shut the video off at the 60 minute mark but I could have gone to the 90 minute mark no problem.
