I like this film in some ways, but there are historical inaccuracies.  First, someone mentioned that Kingsley is Indian. This is only partly true,  because he is only a quarter Indian.  So, there is something to the  argument of "why couldnt they find a real Indian Actor?"  I think  its a fair question.
second - Nehru is seen as defering to Ghandi  throughout the film. This is a false portrayal. Nehru had his own fiercly  held independent beliefs, and although the two men were friends, they had  serious differences over the Mother Cow laws, to name just one example.  Nehru was more influenced by Moghul and English culture, and held on to  that.  Hr even once said that he was probably the last Englishman to rule  India. And he never deferred to Gandhi. 
Also - this portrayal of Ghandi  the saint.  In real life, he was complicated.  But I guess we are asking  too much sometimes when we want film to portray people as morally  complicated. The truth is he probably wasnt a very good father. His  children hated him. One of them became a muslim because he hated his father  so much, and later an alcoholic.
There is much more to this man than  meets the eye.  So, do yourself a favor.  Use this film not as your sole  source of knowing about this period of history.  After all, you shouldnt  rely on film as your only source of understanding history. If you do, your  never really going to know anything. So, do yourself a favor and read a few  books as well, and you will not have a one-dimensional understanding of  history. If you rely on only this film, you remain uninformed.
