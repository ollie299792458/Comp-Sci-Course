Awful. Not viewable. Anyone who ever tried to copy VHS tapes back in the 80's/90's will recall a recurring issue being bad sound. Second generation VHS tape copies would double the noise floor level so it became annoying when viewing the tape at normal sound volume. This copy of Gone in 60 Seconds has that same problem, except it's the worst roaring whine sound I've ever heard in a copied VHS. I imagine this is a 3rd or 4th generation copy done with cheap consumer grade VHS machines. It's awful. Not watchable. I had to stop about one minute into the tape. The video quality is likewise piss-poor 2nd or 3rd generation quality.

Other reviewers have faulted this "remastered" version of the movie on account of it having had the original score replaced with newer musical background. I wouldn't know. Never go to listen to enough of the movie to tell.

This was wasted money. Otherwise, the tape and wrapping looked good. Likewise, I got the tape at a reasonable interval. No delays, no issues.
