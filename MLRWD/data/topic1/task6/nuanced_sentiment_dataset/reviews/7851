I love the new content is great, adds more to some of the characters. But damn...the score was...arg...messed up. They got rid a lot of the old tracks and just shuffled around some stuff. The editing was poor and nothing fit up anymore. They removed all the epic music at the epic moments...and replaced them with boring, mood music.

Speaking of replacing music, something that almost made me just stop watching the movie were 2 parts where the music was replaced by songs from completely different scores, from different movies, not by James Horner.

The first was the sparring scene between Achilles and Patroclus, the music sounds like it was taken right from "The Count of Monte Cristo" from the training montage. hmm....I love the music from the other version way better.

2nd part that was replaced by a different score from a different movie. The fight between Achilles and Hector. This was from "The Planet of the Apes" the newer version. The song sounds like the main titles track....and probably is.

The last part that really pissed me off, but was still music from Troy. The final scene where Achilles is trying down to the statue to save Briseis, they tossed the old music and crammed from other parts in the scene, killing the mood all together and making it so...boring because the music really carried that whole scene.

So in the end, the new content was nice, but the music just pissed me off to no end. I'll stick with the old version.
