The movie is great (4 stars), the extra stuff not.
- documentary: ok, but not too exciting. It more advertises the movie than giving a behind the scene look. A couple of interesting facts, but that's pretty much it.
- 2 interviews: good, but short (15min + 10min). This is the best feature on the DVD. (without these interviews my rating would have been 1 star)
- 3 behind the scenes technical effects: boring, for 10 min we see how to make an armcast.
- 4 commentry: this is the worst commentry, I've ever listened to. Firstly, there is not much talking. Over long stretches, one of the actors may announce the name of an actor we haven't seen beforehand, without giving any further info. And this happens every 5 minutes. Now and than (every 15 min) there is an about 3-4 sentence long communication between both actors, but mostly it's not very interesting. 1/3 of the whole dialog both actors discuss how hot the main actress was. A complete waste of time listening to this...
- 5 extra footage: without sound, and can be given a miss.
- 6 5.1 digital surround sound: Don't expect much difference from the stereo recording.
From a 21st anniverary edition I'd really expect more. If you can find a cheaper non-special release, get that instead. You won't miss any of the bonus features.
