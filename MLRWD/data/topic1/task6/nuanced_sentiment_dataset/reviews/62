I consider myself a pretty advanced exerciser. I've lost over 25 pounds in 6 months using exercise DVD's and my elliptical. I'm now down to a size 4/6 (5'6" - used to be a size 12) and exercise pretty much every day. Two of my absolute favorites were Jillian Michael's Banish Fat Boost Metabolism and No More Trouble Zones. They would kick my ass every time. Well that was the case until I found this DVD! I popped it in and she starts right up. There is only one instructor. I loved that, I felt like I was getting one-on-one training time in. She's not annoying and is quietly motivating.  Very stark contrast to Jillian who's annoying comments leave me putting the DVD on mute the whole time. (Sorry Jillian!) She also constantly reminds you to use proper form and demonstrates it very well too. Her body is a bit masculine, but that didn't put me off. She's had 2 kids, and if she can look that great - well that's motivating to me! I'm here to get healthy and look better, nothing else really matters. I did the two 30 min. parts back to back, and BOY was I feeling it! I was sweating like a dog and sore everywhere. I don't get sore or winded at all anymore from Jillian's DVD's, so I knew my body was working extra hard with this one. I'm very pleased! I love the easy format, it's wonderful to follow along for complete beginners and yet is challenging enough for advanced exercisers too. I used 5 lb. and 10 lb. dumbbells with no problems, too. I'll be doing this one over and over again, I find it more motivating than my other DVD's. Can't wait to do it again!
