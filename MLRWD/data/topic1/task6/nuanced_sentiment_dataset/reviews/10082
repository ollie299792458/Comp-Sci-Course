I am new to nip/tuck, but I have seen the three seasons in succession and, like most people, was hooked and thoroughly impressed by the end of season 2. Season 3 took all the things that made it a good show and cast them to the side. All the characters were doing uncharacteristic things that bordered on cruelty on the part of the writers. Christian has sex with an "ugly" girl by putting a bag on her head. Horrible. What's worse is that the writers decide that it is better that the woman like it. Absolute ridiculousness! Of course the biggest misfire is the Carver, a sidenote from season 2 that was wonderful but became an ongoing mystery that no one wanted to solve. We had storylines that would have been much better to explore - Matt's new dynamic between Sean and Christian, Christian's love for Kimber (great character, until the writers got to her too), Sean's issues about his career (the FBI Witness Protection Program gig could have proven a far more reliable and successful source for storylines). All would have been better than the stupidity of Dr. Costa and his "hideous" sister Kit (how does someone with such a sorted past become a top detective in England that is brought in on a case in Miami that she is unable to solve for well over a year, while she drags everyone in and accuses them of being the murderer? I mean, she dragged in Liz! Preposterous!). Season 3 is abysmal. Best to put it out of your mind and hope season 4 goes back to what made in great in Season 2.
