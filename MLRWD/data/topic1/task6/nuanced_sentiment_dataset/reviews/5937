This disk includes two feature films, both produced by Val Lewton in the mid 1940's. In that time period Lewton produced a handful of horror movies for RKO Studios, of which these are two. Lewton used several directors and writers for these movies, but they all share a similar literary quality and eschew the shock and scare of other horror movies of the time for a more creepy and atmospheric experience.

"I walked With a Zombie" is not nearly as lurid as the title would suggest, it is a well done melodrama with an exotic locale and voodoo. It is very loosely based on the novel "Jane Eyre".

"The Body Snatcher" is based on a Robt. L. Stevenson story and is the better of the two movies. Like "Zombie", it is not a true horror picture, except in the psychological sense. "Body Snatcher" packs a real wallop, Boris Karloff and Henry Daniell are excellent, and Bela Lugosi is wasted in a minor role.

A fine disk and two good movies. The other Val Lewton pics in this series are also good. "The Cat People", "Curse of the Cat People", and "Isle of the Dead" are the others I remember. I think there are several others.

Bottom line: These movies melded horror and melodrama and are very nicely written, produced and directed. They also have a certain literary quality about them that gives them an appeal outside of the horror genre.
