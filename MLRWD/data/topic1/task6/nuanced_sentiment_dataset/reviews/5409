After 33 years since this movie first came out, it still has the power to scare the hell out of you!

Steve Railsback stars as a picture-perfect "Man's Son."  Charlie's whole trip is laid out here, from the Creepy Crawls to him on a jail bunk, with shaven head singing: "You can feed the world with my Garbage Dump."  And the hate stare he gives at the end is the scariest part of the whole movie!

Of all the websites out there now seeking to glorify Manson and make him a urban legend, this movie will ground you with it's "Dragnet" style portrayal of the savage animalistic murders and the three ring circus court proceedings to prosecute that animal and his Garbage People.

Like in the old television series "Dragnet,"..."Just the facts, ma-am!"

There seems to be in the public mind a battle over this version of Helter Skelter and the 2004 TV movie of the same name.  I think they compliment each other.  This one tells of how it was done and how the "family" were convicted.  The new version gets you more into the mind of Manson and WHY it was done and WHY young college student runaways became robotic murders on the "suggestions" of Manson.

Interesting enough, of the major killers, all of them except Manson now recognize the horror of what they have done and take responsibility upon themselves.  Of the original "Family," only Squeaky, Sandy and Bobby Beausoleil are unrepentant and as hard core as always.

For those out there who look upon Manson as a role model, WAKE UP!  There are millions of others who went through hell as a kid who became a inspiration of good to the world!  Manson deliberately heaped all his bad karma upon himself!

"That sums it up in one big lump!"
