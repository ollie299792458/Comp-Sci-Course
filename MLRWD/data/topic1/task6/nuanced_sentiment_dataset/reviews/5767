First the bad...the front of the package says "LIMITED TIME ONLY" Includes bothe 2 disc blu-ray and 1 disc DVD.  OK so I open the package and I see two blu-ray discs, but no DVD.  Not a big deal as we are a home theater family, but it would have been nice to send the DVD to a neice or nephew.

That being said I must insert another con....too many Previews and In Theaters now at the beginning of the movie.  Almost ridiculous, thank goodness for the PS3 skip feature.

Finally the movie....oh man the movie.  I saw this as a child back in the mid 80's as a re-release in theaters, and thought it was pretty amazing then, but on a Home Theater 96 inch screen, with full surround sound (which is fantastic in DTS BTW) set at a humble 720P was almost geek heaven. The clarity was amazing, the colors were amazing, it was like getting a new book that was done by a master painter, and it was if you watch the movie with the commentary on.  Absolutely worth it IMO!

 Well let's just say that any future release of any of the other classic Disney movies will be met with the sound of my credit card being swiped immediately!
