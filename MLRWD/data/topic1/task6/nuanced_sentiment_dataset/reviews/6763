I have to laugh at all those who gave this one star. Not enough car chases and gunplay typical of American action movies for them. These are the same people who would watch "Solaris" and complain it's not Star Wars, or the type that think the Transformer movies are good.

It's not an American action movie. It definitely has a European sensibility. It is a contemplative thriller and character study, not a hyper-violent action movie. The tension percolates, not explodes. We see Clooney's character slowly evolve, trying to remove the armor that has closed him off for so long.

The cinematography is often stunning. Corbijn shows his photographic background in the way he frames shots. There is real tension as the movie moves towards its climax. But it's a quiet, coiled tension, not the cartoonish action we see in too many American films.

The movie has its flaws. The plot is familiar. It is never fully explained why Jack is a target of those after him. But none of this detracts from the movie's strengths, which are considerable to those have the patience to appreciate the art in this film.

Antonioni's "The Passenger" has been mentioned as a comparison. The comparison is not fully apt, other than the similar ending. It is not Anotnioni's best film and its cinematography is sub-par compared to "The American."

This movie is definitely worth viewing, and I predict it will gain in appreciation over time.
