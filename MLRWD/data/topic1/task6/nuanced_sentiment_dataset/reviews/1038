Grace is about Madeline, a desperate mother wanting to have a baby.....apparently alive or dead.  Grace has already lost 2 babies and wants this one more than anything.  Towards the end of her pregnancy, she and her husband are in a bad car accident.  Her husband and baby are both dead, but she is determined to carry the baby to term before delivering.  Once the baby is born, not in a hospital, but at the home of a midwife...everyone can see that the baby is dead.  Madeline is left alone in the room and when everyone comes back...it is a miracle and the baby is alive (well sort of).  At this point the movie really goes beyond horror to just plain...I can't believe I am watching this?

The baby is dead and drinks blood!  I am not giving anything away as from the front picture and the description you can get all of this information.  I love horror films, but this one really had no plot.  That is it....Woman gives birth to dead baby that "lives" and she has to feed her blood.  The movie has no ending it just abruptly ends.

Because of the hype surrounding this movie I invited some friends over and we settled in to watch a great horror film and ALL of us were disappointed.  I can't say that I would watch the movie again....ever.
