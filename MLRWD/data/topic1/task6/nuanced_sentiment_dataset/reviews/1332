Synopsis:  Detective Terry Hoitz (played by Mark Wahlberg) is an angry, yet not necessarily sharp, detective who is assigned to desk duty after accidentally shooting Derek Jeter (himself) at the World Series.  He's partnered up with Detective Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) who is a bookworm/improbable ladies man that would rather work behind a desk than get into the action.  Both of whom respect high-powered detectives Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson), who are respectively at the top of their game.  After Danson and Highsmith end up jumping to their deaths during a bank robbery, this opens up the opportunity for the "other guys" to step up and become the next big pair of detectives.  Though other tandems are taking over the cases that many consider to be tougher and higher priority, Hoitz and Gamble end up uncovering a plot by businessman David Ershon (Steve Coogan) to steal millions in order to cover his company's losses.  Will Hoitz learn to calm it down a bit in order to be effective? Will Gamble grow a pair?  Will "the other guys" be able to unfoil the plot or be unfoiled as police heroes while trying?  Michael Keaton appears as Gene Mauch the hard-nosed captain who moonlights at Bed, Bath, and Beyond while often quoting TLC lyrics.

Keaton was the largest reason while I enjoyed this film because I wasn't expecting him to be as laugh-out-loud funny as he was.  As for the others, Wahlberg's an action guy with a chip on his shoulder, Ferrel's a bumbling pseudo-nerd, and both Jackson and The Rock are hard-nosed and abrasive.  In short, there's really no surprises here; most everyone else is typecast in the types of roles they're known for and this film's no different.  It wasn't bad, just not something that knocked me off my socks.  Keaton's performance makes it a decent rental; fans of action-comedies or humor in the Will Ferrell variety will probably like it enough to purchase.
