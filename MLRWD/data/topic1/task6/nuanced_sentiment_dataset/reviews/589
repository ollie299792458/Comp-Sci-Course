I already wrote a review of this movie,but yesterday I saw the movie and I have to say it just rocks!!! You discover a whole lot of Wolverine's past,and you see wolverine's new nemesis,Lady Deathstrike. Mystique plans a way to get Magneto out of jail and then they go to see the X-Men who were about to crash in the jet into a forest. When Magneto saves the X-Men from crashing,he explains that Stryker persuaded him into revealing the secrets of cerebro. Then,they go to Alkali lake to stop Stryker's evil plot to kill all mutants with cerebro. Then,wolverine rediscovers his past and fights Lady Deathstrike and supposely kills her(believe me,Deathstrike is not dead). Later,when Magneto and Mystique stop cerebro,they reverse it to kill all humans instead of mutants. Of course the X-Men stop it. Then Pyro joins Magneto and leaves with him to become part of the brotherhood. Jean Grey supposely sacrifices her life to save the X-Men,but at the ending you see the form of a pheonix under the water. What could that mean? Of course it means Jean is still alive. So at the end it's obvious they're going to make X-Men 3. And the real war will come between Magneto's brotherhood and Xavier's X-Men.
