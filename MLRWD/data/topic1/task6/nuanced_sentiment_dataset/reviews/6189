I guess you have to be a huge fan of British humor. I mean, so huge, that you love a British movie just for being, well, a British comedy. I'm a big fan of Hugh Grant. I enjoyed Notting Hill and I LOVED Four Weddings and a Funeral.
But this movie was a lame duck. It's supposed to be funny that a little town gets all in an uproar over the fact that what they perceive to be their 'mountain' is a handful of feet short of being considered a mountain, by mountain height standards (MHS). So bent out of shape are they, that they keep the mountain measurers in the town, and while they're not looking, the townsfolk pile dirt and grass on top of the hill, because apparently a hill with a 16 foot mount on top of it makes a mountain.
It's a one joke movie where the joke just isn't funny. To please the viewers, they throw in a romance at the end of the movie that doesn't work. She starts off hitting on our hero just to keep him around, but then falls in love with him...but you really can't tell when that actually happened, considering the romance was thrown in near the end of the movie.
The music gets silly at points where you're supposed to laugh. But the dialogue isn't funny, they make fun of Grant for being English (as if that's worse than being Welsh and obsessing over a hill), and it's just hard to keep wondering how long it'll be until this two hours of snoozefest is finished. For a swerve, the picture on the cover of the movie is a more updated one of Grant. They were smart in not showing what he really looked like in the movie on the cover.
The introduction of the movie was awful, but the scenery was pretty.
Definitely rent this one before you decide to buy. Buying this without previously viewing it would be a HUGE mistake.
