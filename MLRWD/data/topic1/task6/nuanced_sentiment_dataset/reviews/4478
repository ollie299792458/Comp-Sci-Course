Milk is, quite simply, one of the best films I have ever seen.

It may appear that I am biased because I am a gay man and have always admired Harvey Milk and his fight for equality. However this is a film for anyone who has stood up against injustice and intolerance.

Sean Penn deservedly won his 2nd Best Actor Oscar for his phenomenal performance as Harvey Milk. He completely inhabits the role of Harvey Milk - so much that at times I forgot that I was watching Sean Penn.

Josh Brolin is hypnotic as Dan White, James Franco is amazing as Harvey's lover Scott Smith and Emile Hirsch follows up his fantastic performance in Into the Wild with a fantastic performance as the activist Cleve Jones.

Dustin Lance Black's screenplay is pitch-perfect and Gus Van Sant's direction is simply breath-taking. The real life footage of the march in the aftermath of the assassinations of both George Moscone and Harvey Milk is moving beyond words.

An outstanding achievement.
