First, let me tell you I was excited to see this one. I borrowed it with the instructions to "watch it in the daytime" so of course I watch it at night, lights off with a bowl of popcorn...

Well, the movie started out really good. Lots of creepy potential. How many other movies take a seriously frightening concept as a random murder (just bc!) and put it to work? Unfortunately it kinda sucked. I'm sorry but just not my cup of tea. It was not scary--the idea was--but the actual movie was boring.

I willed myself to watch it thinking "Oh! Something's gonna happen!" or "Yes, come on, turn around and start screaming!" Sadly, my will wasn't strong enough for the lengthy silences and the pointless scare-tactics as the main people failed to even SEE them most of the time. Last part I remember is the sweet couple in their backyard, scared & whispering, and then that must have been when I dozed off. Because the next thing I knew, I woke up in time for the last 5 minutes... and I almost wished I had stayed asleep. Sorry but I just didn't get this movie. Strangers should have just been called Strange. One star.
