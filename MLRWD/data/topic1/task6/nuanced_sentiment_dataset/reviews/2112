Since books are almost always better than movies made of them, films mostly suffer in comparison. This film is no exception but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. It is very engrossing and keeps you guessing all the way through. It's based on a true story. Robin Williams' understated performance was just right for the character of Gabriel Noone, a gay radio personality who becomes involved over the phone with people he is not sure exist. Toni Collette is excellent in her role too. The directing is unobtrusive and gladly features no MTV-style camera trickery like oversaturated color or other visual gimmicks that so many other movies use these days. The story is mysterious and surprisingly very emotional. My only criticism is that the movie should have been longer than 82 minutes.

I read the book after seeing it and it was great---a real page turner with a lot of heart, but also quite sad. The movie could have included a lot more of the story. The screenplay was co-written by Armistead Maupin, the author of the book, so its hard to understand why it was so truncated. However, the content left out was largely about the character's gayness and family life. Perhaps they thought it would be more acceptable to the general public this way, but it lacks the depth of character you get from the book. My recommendation is to see this film and if you like it, read the book afterward. You will enjoy both that way, but if you have read the book already, you might be disappointed in the film. Still, it is worth seeing for yet another excellent performance by Robin, who seems to have shed his comic persona for more serious and substantial roles, with great success.
