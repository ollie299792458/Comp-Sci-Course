Stone Cold will always be revered as one of the greatest superstars ever in the wrestling industry. The beer drinkin madman I grew up with will always be one of my favorite wrestlers, which is why I am disappointed in this dvd. I own the Bret Hart Collection and his ten minutes on Stone Cold was better than the Stone Cold dvd. You know how in the Bret Hart dvd, the DX dvd, and the Shawn Michaels dvd has not only the superstar talking, but the people they affected in the business? Guess what this dvd had, stone cold and he didn't look to happy to be there either. The dvd focuses more on wcw and ecw, than in wwe. He mentioned the rock and they had two matches on there. Not once did they have the Vince McMahon feud. They only had very few interviews which made me sad because the dude was hilarious and was damn good behind the mic. They had Austin 3:16 in there and Steveamania but thats it. His beginning matches are. . . .well boring as hell, his later matches good. I recommend to you, that you buy the Raw 15th anniversary dvd and watch the second disk. The second disk is basically all Austin.
