I read all the reviews about the transfer quality, but as a Spartacus fan, I ordered it anyway.I should really listen to the reviews. I think that this version is worse than the Criterion edition.That at least it didn't pretend to be anything other than an excellent restoration of the film.

I have been dissapointed in a lot of Blu Ray discs lately.The most recent was "The War The Worlds" That didn't laook any different than the regular copy.
Too many films of late are rushed out to make that extra buck.But that being said, Avatar was georgous, and better than seeing it in the theatre.

I understand the limitations of an older film, but when a new film comes out in Blue Ray it should be spectacular.

Spartacus needs the full treatment, this version is sloppy. I thought the color was inconsistant, and most times over saturated.
Skin tones and textures are muddy

The sharpness was  an issue. Someone mentioned "The Music Man" as a good example of Blu Ray restoration. I totally agree. That film is now pristine in every way.

I hope Criterion or someone does a beter job.
