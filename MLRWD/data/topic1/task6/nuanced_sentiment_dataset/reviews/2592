It took me a while after purchasing this DVD to sit down and watch it because I was waiting for the most opportune moment.  Everybody "warned" me that the movie would freak you out, gross you out and make you vomit due to the violence and sexually explicit footage.  However, the movie was a dissapointment in every aspect.  First of all, the sexually explicit footage that everybody warns you about is really nothing worse than what you'd find in any good Italian art gallery.  The violance is all very obviously staged and there is nothing really that gross until, maybe, the last couple of scenes where they are torturing the captives.  I've seen worse in the Hannibal Lector Series.  Most disappointing, however, was the complete lack of any discernable, credible, coherent plot or theme other than your average sick, poorly acted porn.  I thought there would be some credible nexus with Fascism, Nazi Germany's occupation of Italy or even WW II.  Instead, just some vague tenuous links made by using a few german soldiers in insignificant bit parts.  If there was anything deeper it requires just too much deep analysis -- akin to studying Nuclear Physics or Chemistry -- and I just prefer to sit down, relax and have a film effortlessly transport my mind into another time and place where you can "live" or "experience" the events.  This film failed miserably in every aspect.  If you paid $29.99 for it, you got cheated out of $29.00.  There is more redeeming social value in Tom & Jerry.
