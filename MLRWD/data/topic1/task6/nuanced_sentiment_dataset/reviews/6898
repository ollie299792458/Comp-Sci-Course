Gundam SEED is the original Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 redone for a new generation.  This first volume starts off in much the same way as the original, with a peaceful colony housing a top secret prototype robot named Gundam being attacked.  A young boy named Kira finds himself in the Gundam and ends up fighting out of necessity and not choice and over time becomes an ace and person who grows up through war.

This series has a twist where instead of a war for independence between the Earth Federation and the Zeon, it is a war of revenge between Z.A.F.T. (Coordinators: humans genetically engineered at birth to unlock more of their potential)and the Earth Federation (Naturals: ordinary people who have not been genetically enhanced).  In Vol. 1 Kira and his friends are living in a neutral colony when Z.A.F.T. attacks looking to capture the 5 Gundam units and destroy the new Federation battleship, Archangel.  Things don't go as planned with Kira ending up in one of the Gundams and his childhood best friend appearing as one of the ace Z.A.F.T. pilots trying to steal them.  Eventually, him and his friends end up on the Archangel with one of the Gundams and what is left of the Federation crew and staff after a catastrophic Pearl Harbor like attack.  The Archangel attempts to escape from the enemy in a pretty decent fight between 3 ships and all 5 of the Gundams.

Vol. 1 is a good intro to the world and story of Gundam SEED containing episodes 1 - 5, with much of it being a teaser for things to come. The Gundam and Kira's abilities only barely touched upon.
