I saw pieces of this movie in the past, when flipping channels. I was impressed by Jimmy Stewart's characterization and finally wanted to see the entire movie. American classic, right? John Ford? Yes. I wanted to see it. I recorded it on my DVD from TCM and prepared to enjoy.

Unfortunately, once we are into the picture itself, I find that Jimmy Stewart is too old to play the young lawyer---convincingly or otherwise. He's fine as the aging senator, but he just doesn't make sense in the core role, which is the heart of the movie. John Wayne is his usual Stock Manly Self (this movie did NOT need John Wayne in it---a good character actor would've done just as well), and he uses that expression "Pilgrim" in this one about ten times in the first 15 minutes. Sadly, hearing him say "Pilgrim" makes me view Wayne as a caricature here.

Lee Marvin is great to watch, at times, a real trip (anyone ever see that great old Dragnet episode he was in, from back in the early 50s?), but he is way tooooo evil for this part. It's overkill. A man with a silver whip?? This is almost comic relief. But it's not a comedy...

I think this is a Western that Ford made at the end of a played-out string. The story is compelling but told in a way that holds no surprises. It's just, here's Jimmy Stewart, here's John Wayne, here's Andy Devine, here's the bully everybody hates and fears, here's the town and the dust and the stagecoach. In a black-and-white wrapper, without any real tension in it. (You can do a lot with black-and-white; Ford just didn't do it here!)

You may enjoy it for many reasons, but the potentially enjoyable aspects were ruined for me because it was so inadequately done. I guess I've seen too many Westerns by now (I'm 52). I found it all kinda silly, but mainly because IT WASN'T WELL DONE. Ford could've done better---a whole lot better, with less clutter. We all know he had it in him.
