Adam Sandler stars as Bobby Boucher (pronounced Booshay) who is a waterboy for a college football team in Louisiana but Coach Red (Jerry Reed) is fed up with the waterboy and he asks the assistant coach on why he didn't fire him, he tells Red that he didn't think that he was serious and later on Bobby winds up being the waterboy for a new football team and he tackles one of the football players for making fun of him and the coach (Henry Winkler) is impressed his Bobby's tackling abilities and Bobby ends up playing for the football team and there's a laugh-out-loud scene when Bobby tackles the teacher for making fun of his mama and the teacher looks alot like Colonel Sanders, later on we meet Bobby's new girlfriend Vicki Valencourt and Mama tells Bobby that she is the devil (the way she usually describes people cause her husband left her when she was pregnant with Bobby).
Overall I didn't think that the Waterboy was one of Adam Sandler's better movies cause his voice gets kind of annoying after a while but since I am a fan of Adam Sandler's work, I'm going to give this movie 3.5 stars instead of 3.
