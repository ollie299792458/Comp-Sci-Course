I recieved this about a week early so I'll give a little insight to it:

It comes in a very large box with the cover art you've seen already inside that is a white inside box with the certificate on top my number is 03920 of 10000 then under is the sterophome packaging.

Inside the sterophome lies the ape head!!!!

This is one beautiful head very very nice!!

The DVDs are housed on the back side of the ape, on the shirt there is a flap of cloth that comes up that velcros back shut inside is the great 14 disc set of dvds.

The dvd packaging is very well done not like those other large sets like the alien quad. or taken with those glues that come off.  The packaging is done incredibly well, there is a booklet attached which basically gives the credits to each of the discs.  No plot outlines so first timers won't be ruined by that.

Right now I have watched films 1-3 out of the set and am working my way through it, the films are very clear and the audio is really well done.

This is truly one great set for any Planet of the Apes fan, a must have, it was perfect for me since I didn't have any of these before but just rented them.  Amazing simply amazing, enjoy it when you get it.  It is a treasure!
