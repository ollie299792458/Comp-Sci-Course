Something is very wrong here!  I have received this product from two different venders and have been ripped off both times! Yes, my money was refunded in both instances, but the problem remains.  The problem is that this is meant to be a two-cassette DVD package.  In both orders I received only Disc 2, which was extra features.  Ostensibly, the movie was on Disc one which was not included.  Furthermore, the case is built to contain just one disc so this is more than a coincidental packing error.  It really appears that a common supplier is not paying any attention to what they are doing, nor are the venders.  If someone complains, they get their money back.  Everyone else gets ripped off.  These were my first two attempts ever to buy anything on Amazon.com and the whole experience has been discouraging and disheartening.  I still want the movie, but I don't want to keep beating my head against the wall in a system that is broken and has no handyman to look into it.  Wouldn't it be nice if people took pride in what they do?
