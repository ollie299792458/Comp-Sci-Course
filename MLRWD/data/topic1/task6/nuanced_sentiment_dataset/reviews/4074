"THE HAPPENING", a story that is hard to believe.  People in the North Eastern part of the United States are suddenly stuck by some sort of toxin.  At first, no one knows where this toxin is coming from and it is assumed to be a terrorist attack. The unbelievable part of the story  is how the characters react to this horrifying toxin.  Those who have been exposed, randomly start jumping out of buildings and genrally find ways to kill themselves. Characters who are witnessing this debacle, don't scream, run, or react as real people. But, all to calmly, decide to leave town by taking a train to a relatives house.

The main characters, a science teacher and his despondent wife, have no real passion in their relationship.  And, in my opinion, are not very interesting.  The hero and heroine have not been fully developed and do not make the audience wish for their well being.

Many of the characters in this film are flat and unintersting.  Shyamalan, could have made the charaters more demensional and shared more of the secondary characters' lives. If he had done this, the audience would care whether they lived or died.  He only gives out bits and pieces of personalities that have no substance.

This movie is worth the look if you rent it, however, paying theater prices to see it is not recommended.
