*HUGE SPOILERS DONT READ IF YOU HAVENT WATCHED*

Ok so let me begin by saying that was more than an hour of my life that I'll never get back. This movie is such a twisted wreck that alot of it deserves to be put back into the toilet it was created in.
First off, there was NO sense of plot what so ever. Her dad is haunting her? The horse is haunting her? Some demon looking thing that looks like a moth is haunting her? She went crazy? See, these were all good plotlines, I dont see why the director couldnt choose one to go with.
Second, there was a very decent couple of scenes in this movie. (The vicious make-out and the grisly end of the cheating piece of crap.)
third, the ending was very confusing. The sister goes back into the house and sees what's in the closet, reaching out for it much like Molly. Does that hint at a "Lovely Hannah". I certainly hope not.

All in all, I give Lovely Molly a one star rating. Mostly because of the few scenes that were very good and great atmosphere. I would wait until this movie does tv premieres, it's really not worth your money.
