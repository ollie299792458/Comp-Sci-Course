As is usually the case I listened to all the hype and the critic reviews and just purchased this movie. I do have all the original Planet of the Apes movies and thoroughly enjoy them and thought I would add this to the collection. It wasn't a dreadful movie but it didn't hook me creating that I want to know what will happen next feeling.  The story line of how the apes became intelligent was interesting.  Franco wasn't interesting or convincing as a scientist. The time lines in the story made no sense.  For instance Franco takes Cesar home and then it is 3 to 5 years later! In that time there is no mention or updates original formula? What has he been working on at the lab? He has been doing a lot of work but at home but is never seen at the lab doing a thing. He meets a girl and bam they are what living together, married and doing what for those 3 to 5 years. Franco has an Ape and is living next door to a family with children. The family doesn't contact anyone when there are incidents of the Ape escaping and getting into their yard and around their kids!  It seems the story could have been better mapped out and the characters more endearing but then this movie would have needed to be four hours long.
