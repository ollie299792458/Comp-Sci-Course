" JULIUS CAESAR ", by WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE; 1970 Movie Version Review:

SIR JOHN GIELGUD as Julius Caesar proved that he is a master of his craft;
DIANA RIGG (Portia, M. Brutus' wife), DEREK GODFREY (the cunning Decius Brutus), and JILL BENNETT (Calpurnia, J. Caesar's wife) were also all very good.  But,

RICHARD JOHNSON's volitile portrayal of Gaius Cassius STOLE THE SHOW as one of SHAKESPEARE's best antagonists in this classical drama.

CHARLTON HESTON (Marc Antony) would also have been very good, but his entire performance was upstaged by that ridiculous red wig he wore... what were they thinking?  An Irish Marcus Antonius?

JASON ROBARDS is historically a very capable Ocsar-winning actor.  However, cast as Marcus Brutus here, he delivered SHAKESPEARE's emotionally-charged dialogue in a boring, almost annoying monotone voice.
The only emotion he showed in the whole movie was in his "war-of-words" with Cassius (RICHARD JOHNSON) in the tent before the Battle of Phillipi.

ROBERT VAUGHN apparently honed some good acting skills after being "The Man From U.N.C.L.E." on TV, and delivered a surprisingly fine portrayal of the devious Senator/Conspirator Casca.  And,

RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN was competent as Octavian Augustus Caesar (which is not much of a role in this play); but as a wise thespian named Kildare once said, "there are no small roles, only small doctors".

It's a MYSTERY who portrayed GAIUS LIGARIUS, the play's eighth Senator/Conspirator seen in this movie.  Neither the character nor the actor are named in the credits, on DVD, VHS, in the movie's website, or on IMDb.  The Invisible RoMan?

STUART BURGE as Director turned in a production equal to his 1965 movie version of Shakespeare's OTHELLO, with Sirs Laurence Olivier and Derek Jacobi.

ROBERT FURNIVAL's Adapted Screenplay was basically true to SHAKESPEARE.
KENNETH HIGGINS' Cinematography was first-rate and visually appealing.

OVERALL, I rate this production a 7.5 on a ten-scale.

ONE FINAL FOOTNOTE: SIR JOHN GIELGUD was also in the cast of the 1953 movie version of JULIUS CAESAR, with Marlon Brando and James Mason.  He portrayed Gaius Cassius brilliantly.  And, yes, CASSIUS stole the show in that version as well.  I recommend you watch both of them !
