For those of you who loved this movie despite the corny, rather confusing  ending or those who just couldn't get past the ending, the special edition  finally brings justice to a fantastic film.
The special edition includes  28 minutes sliced from the theatrical version to keep the movie within a  Studio accepted length. A significant portion of the additional footage  comes towards the end. It explains the motivations of the NTIs  (non-terrestrial intelligence), creating a much more powerful finale to the  film.
In addition to the special edition film, the two discs takes full  advantage of the wonders of DVD technology. A fascinating documentary takes  the viewer through the extraordinary trials and tribulations encountered in  the making of the film. I truly was amazed by the dedication of Cameron,  the crew, and the actors to bring this film to life. Furthermore, a wealth  of information is provided in storyboards, pictures, etc that would make  any film student drool.
I own "The Abyss" on VHS and it pales  in comparison to the DVD version. I only wish all my favorite films on DVD  contained the thrilling additions this one does.
