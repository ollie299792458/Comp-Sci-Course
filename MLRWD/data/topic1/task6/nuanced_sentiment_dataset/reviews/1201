I have seen this over 10 years ago in the theater and was so in love with the movie's uplifting spirit that I bought this BD. The plot is great, the scenery fresh and inviting, but somehow the actor, Roberto Benigni, has lost his magic with me this time around. The guy overacts, talks took much, but the message is forever young: "Don't take life so seriously, even when life suddenly foreclosed on you: your family is now being taken to the Nazi concentration camp and your little boy, the product of your fairy tale love with your ideal woman. The boy is so adorable and his acting memorable and so is his mother's (Nicoletta Braschi) enchanted affection for her crazy,high-strung eccentric jester. If you have young school-age children,this movie would be perfect, let them see it, I'm sure the strange twist and turn and the father's crazy antics will delight them. Setting in beautiful Italy before the onset and during WWII. (Please choose the original Italian spoken script and the English subtitle but not the English spoken language and the English subtitle together, they don't jive!)
