Jean Renoir's Rules of the Game is a classic among classics in cinema.  One would be hard pressed to find a reputable critic who doesn't put this film in  their top-ten films of all time.  This isn't just a critics' film either.  It is filled with satiric wit and brilliant ideas, not to mention it's look and pace.  That said, when Criterion puts out a film like this with the extras they unearth, the price is reasonable.  When this company releases a film you know you are going to get a pristine transfer, (of a 65 year-old film) and extras that actually get into the film.  Not an HBO making of featurette that has the actors telling you what you already know.  These are featurettes that they have licenced from European broadcasters or small independent companies.
A good example is Criterion's release of Tarkovsky's Solaris versus Soderberg's Solaris which was released by Universal.  Criterion's extras are head and shoulders above the Universal release.  As much as I loved Soderberg's version of the novel, the extras were painfully out of place.
When Criterion releases a film (especially in a double disc edition as is Rules of the Game) it isn't merely just your average dvd release, it is almost an event.  And worth every penny.
