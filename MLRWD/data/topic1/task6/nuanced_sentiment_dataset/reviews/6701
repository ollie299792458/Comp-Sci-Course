I really wanted to love "New York, New York", but, I guess I am not an intellectual movie watcher.  Gritty "real life-like" stories do not entertain me.  BUT, the music, costumes and sets tip the balance to "like".  I understand what Scorsese wanted to accomplish and he succeeded.  DeNiro's character is so very unlikeable; it is difficult to root for his success. Minnelli's character is such a doormat, I just want to shake her and say "Snap out of it!"  I guess the movie's point is there are no real "happy endings", they are reserved for the MGM musicals of the 1950s.  This realism might be artistic but not entertaining.  If I want "real", I would stay home and watch real people doing real things for free.  Liza's musical numbers brought the movie up a star.  The special features told me some things I never knew about the film, but the Scorsese commentary would be better served in a separate interview, NOT running through the film.  He was so intent on convincing us he was an "artist", it got boring.

Granted, the characters should never be together and I do not want a "sappy ending", but after several hours, I really wanted to like someone in the movie.
