An insipid movie at best. Pitt and Roberts have obviously  been slapped together for some kind of money maker. The Mexican feels like a bad episode of Friends crossed with one of those post Tarantino, rubbish gangster films. Three things tricked me into seeing this movie, the Dreamworks logo (usually reliable) the name of Lawrence Bender and many good reviews, one even saying this was the best crime film since Out of Sight. Hardly. I enjoy long films when they are good, The Mexican was long, flat and boring at just over 2 hours. Studio notes were stuck all over The Mexican and you could see the committee behind every decision, surprisingly though the dialogue was left in long winded flat monologues which made for tedious viewing. People wanting to structure dialogue like Tarantino or Kevin Smith should be first talented. Attempted jokes were simple and had me coughing dust off them. The Mexican tried to be multi-layered but succeeded in making the stories involved way to distant and the director (who should go back to directing kids films) didn't have any idea how to better relate them. Oh and let me not forget what will be the new Hollywood cliche of the future, the unexpected gay character. I found the dog mildly amusing but I could see the feel good committee behind him also. The Mexican may well mark the film where Dreamworks went from a company with vision, to just another big, blundering studio.
