The movie centers around two Christin Cursaders /Knights (Cage and Perlman) who are called upon by the church to deliver a young girl accused of being a witch to to a distant abby. All in the hope that the monks at the abby can determine her guilt or innoncence; and save the world from the plague in the process; the girl is thought to be the cause of the plague.

The two Knightts are joined on their journey by another Knight who lost his daughter to the plague, a priest, an alter boy, and a crocked mechant who acts as their guide.  On their journey to the abby, they face numerous perils; all while learning more about the innocence or guilt of the accused witch.

There are a couple of great twist at the end, and enough action throughout to keep you engaged. Cage and Perlman, in my opinion, are never really believable in period pieces....it's their accents...or lack there off, that distracts from the character.  I actually think the minior characters are the ones that make this movie a 4 star...some decent acting among this bunch.

For those concerned about violence...well, the film does have quite a bit of violence....however, its not very gory.  I think its ok for 13 year olds and older; and the film does contain some religious themes, but is far from preachy.

Acting: Pearlman & Cage "B"
Acting: Remaining cast  "A"
Story:  "B"
Special Effects/Cinematography: "B"

Its worth renting...good flick if you're sitting at home on Saturday night.....
