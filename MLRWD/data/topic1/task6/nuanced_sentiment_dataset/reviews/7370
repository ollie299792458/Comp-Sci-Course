Edgar Allen Poe stories modernized by George A. Romero and Dario Argento.  Sounds like it can't miss, right?

The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar is George Romero's part.  At only an hour the film somehow seems overlong.  It looks like Romero's on a sedative here, the pacing is way too slow and in the end nothing much happens.  There's one decent zombie scene near the end and the finale is quite horrific but I'm sure Mr. Romero could have spiced things up somewhat.  It looks like his heart wasn't all together in this project.

Dario Argento's The Black Cat is way better than Romero's film.  Loosely adapting Poe's original story and splicing in numerous references from other Poe stories, The Black Cat has moody and creepy atmosphere to spare along with some solid suspense.  Harvey Keitel gives a good performance in the lead, Tom Savini serves up some great gore effects and Dario, fresh from his insane camera-acrobatics in 1987's ultra violent Opera, is in top form with some great stylistic touches left and right.

This Blue-Underground 2 Disc Special Edition is really the only way to go, some great extras included here.  An interesting documentary with intetviews with both Argento and Romero and some very entertaining behind the scenes footage, along with Blue-Underground's usual high standard in terms of audio and visual quality.

In short; Two Evil Eyes is well worth purchasing; terrific Argento segment and good extras.  What's not to like?
