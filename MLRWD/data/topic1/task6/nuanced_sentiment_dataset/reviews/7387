A preference of director Simon Rumley for this film's title before its release was THE LIVING IN THE HOME OF THE DEAD since the work that he formulated is based round his potent emotional reactions to the death of his mother from cancer, an exhausting event for Rumley as well as for the disease's victim.  The film will be at least in part artistically inaccessible to those viewers who will be uncomfortable watching a rather nauseous compendium of scenes filled with the actions of an obvious madman, in addition to unbridled drug usage, gore, feces, and vomitus.  For the most part, Rumley employs a brilliantly expressionistic method in order to reflect his repugnance at recollecting the dismal three month decline into death of his mother, with his intent here obviously being communication to viewers of his ruinous sense of incertitude and bewilderment, quite conventional states for one observing another person gradually perish.  Because there is no particular linear aspect to the narrative, the tone of the film steadily becomes surreal, with incongruous and often ostensibly senseless scenes born from a nightmarishly burdened subconscious, and while handling of this type of episode seems at times laboured and in poor taste, a viewer should be aware of the internal flaying that became a primary determinant for the piece.  Shot in only eighteen days within the voluminous Cardigan Savernake House in Wiltshire, England, using eight of the derelict structure's 250 rooms, the picture is efficiently crafted by director, cast and crew, and offers a bravura turn from Leo Bill playing as addled son of a dying woman.  The film was in reality constructed during post-production editing, and there will be precious little for a majority of viewers to like, since the affair plainly is too repellent for most audiences.  None the less, one looks forward to whatever the talented Rumley will provide next, now that this purgative production has been completed.
