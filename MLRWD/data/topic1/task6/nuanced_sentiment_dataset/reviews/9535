As an English and Reading Teacher of newcomers into the United States, I find this film not only an OSCAR WINNER but also an awakening film for all teens to view. My reason for recommending this film especially to teenagers is because often times, parents undergo much danger and adventure to get into the United States. Their drive is to offer their own children THE AMERICAN DREAM. Yet, once their children are in the United States, a severe language, cultural, and emotional detachment between the hard working parents and their children grows stronger each and every MONTH. This film Voces Innocentes, awakens the falsely arrogant (ignorant) teen into a setting of reality. A child's narrative is difficult to ignore, especially when it involves true historical events. When viewed by teenagers who still grab a hold of their soul, a re-newed appreciation for ALL of their parents struggles and efforts surfaces into a re-born family concept. More often than not, I've witnessed a drastic change in our youth in a vastly positive manner simply by watching this gloriously produced film. Thank you for creating such a high caliber of a Spanish-speaking film of historical events shared from a little boy's point of view. Bravo!!!
