When I first watched this movie in the theater, I came out totally disappointed and disgusted and wanted my time and money back. Now, after watching it again on DVD, I have changed my opinion somewhat.

The story is actually pretty good with Picard rebelling against the Federation for what he thinks is right (Prime Directive) - his career be damned! And the Son'a, the exiled children of the Ba'ku, seeking revenge on their parents and using the Federation to help them is an interesting idea. The crew feels natural and you can sense a real chemistry between them in this movie. The acting is top-notch, especially by the main Son'a villain Ad'har Ru'afo. The relationship between Picard and the Ba'ku woman Anij is very intriguing as well.

The thing that bothers me about this one is the humor. I guess the intent was to go back to a light-hearted movie like "The Voyage Home," but the humor doesn't work well in this movie like it did in "Voyage." In "Voyage," the crew were on a past Earth with no imminent threat, so the humor fit in since they weren't under any real pressure. But with "Insurrection," the crew is under attack from the Son'a and the humor seems out of place and awkward in light of the urgency of their situation. Not to mention some of the jokes are very cheesy - Data is a personal flotation device?! Huh?

So, altogether a good story with great acting but some misplaced (and sometimes cheesy) humor really disrupts the flow of the story and the feeling of threat and urgency. Not the worst of the Star Trek movies ("The Final Frontier" still holds that distinction for me), but an average one.
