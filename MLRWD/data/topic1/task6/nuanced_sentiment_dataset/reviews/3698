Ken Burns has established a fine reputation for the illustrated biography or history.This production features the life of Mark Twain as it might be set in the sights and locations of his life.The photographs and illustrations carry the story while we are informed and entertained by the narrative that accompanies them.So we get to both see the places and people of that actual time and to hear the authentic voices of Twain and his contemporaries.
Twain was,more than anything else,a wisecracker.He dealt with the world around him by bringing out its humorous side.However,the picture that emerges from this documentary is a fully rounded person,who suffered his fair share of human sadness.By the end of the program,we feel that we have come to know more than just the comic Twain.Among his trials was the loss of a beloved child and he also had to deal with the business side of life,not a sphere in which he did very well.
This program conveys richly the lives of main stream Americans in the 19th century.Burns gives us a clear sense of what it was like to grow up along the mighty Mississippi.Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer and all the rest of Twain's gang of characters are located realistically in the world they convey so well in the books.
Ken Burns is the master of this kind of photographic presentation and his film is a purchase that will have you going back again and again to recapture that fabled world.Unlike many other DVDs that you might buy,this one is a treasure for life.
