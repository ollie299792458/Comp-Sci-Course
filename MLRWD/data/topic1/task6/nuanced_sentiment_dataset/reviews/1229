The consensus seems to be that The Beyond is a stylish film wihout much in the way of plot. I agree with the lack of plot, but I wonder how anyone -- even the most devoted of Fulci fans -- could call this film stylish, that is, unless style is by definition that which contains an infinity of bad special effects. I can't stop thinking about the spider scene -- spider marionettes eating latex. And then there's the acid scene . . . and the dog scene. Fulci seems to construct these death scenes for the purpose of showing excessive gore. I have no issue with excess, it's just that the effects in this film are so amateurish and laughable that they try to add a "camp" value to this work, a value that is undermined by Fulci's serious tone. 
Fulci wants to make a great film, but doesn't have the budget to do so. Rather than restraining himself to protect the project's greatest weakness, that being its meager budget, Fulci insists on going as far as possible, even if that means putting on film effects that would be laughed out of film school. To Fulci's credit, The Beyond is clearly the work of someone who can't be bothered with dissenting opinions. I suppose that I admire his courgage. 
I am not a Fulci hater. In fact, Zombie, New York Ripper and Don't Torture a Duckling are good horror films, in my opinion. Beyond, in my humble opinion, is a piece of amateurish trash that you ought to avoid like the plague. If you are a fan of Fulci, however, and especially of this overrated film, you will appreciate the disc, which is of admirable quality.
