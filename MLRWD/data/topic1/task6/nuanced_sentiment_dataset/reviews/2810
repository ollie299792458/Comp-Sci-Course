Okay, I saw the original ages ago and loved it! When I found out there was a remake I decided to rent the old version and watch it again to see if it was as good as I'd remembered it to be and it was.  It was chilling and suspenseful.  Terry O'Quinn was fantastic in the role of the stepfather.  The original moved along quickly but it was thorough from beginning to end.  The stepfather was a methodic, homocidal lunatic - instantly evident from the eery opening scene of him cheerfully whistlng a tune as he non-chalantly leaves the bloody bodies of his family strewn all over the house, on his way to start a new life and find a new family.  We get a sense of a very disturbed childhood when we find him losing touch with reality during an angry outburst while he is alone in his basement... the movie was just really well done. There were many little moments that spoke volumes in the original and, unfortunately, they were left out of the new version or altered in a way that made them less effective.

The new version was... well, it was okay.  The acting, the plot and character changes.  It was all okay but this movie didn't really need to be remade.  It felt a little stale or sedate in comparison to the original movie.  The original is far superior and still worth watching.  This one will be okay if you haven't seen the original or if you want a mildly entertaining, light thriller.
