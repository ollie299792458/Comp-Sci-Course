First off, Reservoir Dogs is a wonderful movie.  It's funny, smart and entertaining.  The dialogue is superb, as is Quentin Tarantino's other masterpiece Pulp Fiction, but the characters in Reservoir Dogs are just great.  Even though they're criminals, you can relate to many of their dilemmas and motives during the course of the movie.  The acting is also top-notch, and, for a movie where the actors had to wear their own suits to the set, very proffessional looking.  Watch this movie.
The DVD packaging is a pretty cool concept, with the different character covers, but if your going to buy this DVD just for that, don't.  The advertisements boast "a booklet with many memorable quotes and photos".  Sure there are quotes, but I wouldn't consider TWO being many.  Well, maybe they consider two many when they repeat each one TWICE, but I sure don't.  The photos are nice, but each one is the size of half a page, so there aren't all that many.  The extras are good, but not really great.  
All in all, the movie alone is worth buying this DVD, and the extras are just an added bonus to an already wonderful experience.
