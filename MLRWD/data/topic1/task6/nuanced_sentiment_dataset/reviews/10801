I rented this because i like old hollywood and i heard it was good boy was i wrong. This movie is well made and directed well it should be it sure cost a lot to make but it is rather dull. I kept thinking as i watch this movie that the actors playing the real life people do not look or act like the person they are playing. Some of the story is wrong like that Ava Gardner stuck by him after he cheated on her that was wrong Ava never did that she never put up with any crap her men did to her. Actually i am not a Leo fan but he was good in it considering he looks to much like a sissy to play Howard Hughes. The Howard Hughes story is very interesting but you be better of watching a good documantary which this 2 cd set comes with. One more thing i am sick and tired of Miramax promoting boring movies to death for oscar consideration. All of these movies are forgetable the only one that people like and remeber today is Pulp Fiction. Thankfully the Oscars came to there senses and this movie did not win best picture or director, just becasue scoresse is a great director that has not won before that does not mean he deserves it for this movie which is probably one of his worst. And by the way Millon Dollar baby deserved to win best picture it is very moveing and well acted and made and stays with you long after you seen it i cant say that to this movie.
