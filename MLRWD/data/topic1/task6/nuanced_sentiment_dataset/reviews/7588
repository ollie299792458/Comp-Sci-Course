It seems to me it is a film so full of itself that it was concerned from the start it would be considered for greatness.."Unforgiven"reminds me of a very different film years ago called "The Verdict"in that way;it seems to have been made with Oscar in mind..It is dark and violent  ,and sometimes unintentionaly camp(some of the lines are so obviously meant to be legendary , it reminds me  of a Mad magazine take-off) Do the girls playing the  1880`s prostitutes really look  like you`d imagine the  real mean thing did from those days or did someone page the set of "One Life To Live" in central casting?Or the blind, sharp shooting hombre?Now there was a real hoot! Where was Dennis Hopper when Clint needed him?But there are some entertaining performances in it (Hackman and Harris and the ever reliable Morgan Freeman.Buy it for that and the very good(though dark)transfer.The film  for me,however, was a real disappointment.3 bullets.If you want a really, realistic western,rent out "The Wild Bunch"
