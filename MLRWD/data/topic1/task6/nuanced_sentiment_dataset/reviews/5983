I purchased this based on the good review from Leonard Maltin (when will I learn?) and the same from others on this page. Although this film certainly has good moments, that is all they are... moments, and brief at that. As is common with many horror films, the opening is interesting and draws you in, creating expectations of possibilities within the viewer. I'm sad to say that in what follows, these expectations are never realized, only coming close in two very short scenes and in the conclusion of the film. But, 20 minutes of interesting scenes do not save this film.
I should have (perhaps) prefaced this review by saying I am fan and aficionado of horror films, and in particular, those with Vampire themes. This is worth a look, if for no other reason than to satisfy one's curiosity, but the plain truth is, unless you have money to burn, this film is not worth the purchase price -- unless you need it to complete a collection of films of this genre.
Slow, with some interesting scenes. Had potential, but fell short of the mark. One and a half stars.
