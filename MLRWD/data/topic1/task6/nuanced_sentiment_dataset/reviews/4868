The movie was very entertaining.

It is one I would have purchased except for (1) thing - the UltraViolet digital copy.  I refuse to buy ANY blu-ray that only comes with an UltraViolet digital copy. I've fought with those things since they day they came out. I spend a lot of time commuting and rely on the digital copies included with the movies I buy so I can enjoy them in transit.  UltraViolet is a nightmare - seperate programs, seperate accounts and the possibility that your "digital copy" can be revoked at any time.  I miss the good old days where you simply popped in a disk (or entered a code) and had a copy automatically added to your iTunes account.

As such, I will NOT buy this Blu-ray or any others that do come with the faux UltraViolet digital copy. I'm passing on "The Amazing Spiderman" same as I did with "Sherlock Holmes - A Game of Shadows" and "Men in Black 3".  I would have paid for the complete 3D deluxe blu-ray versions of these movies had they come with a TRUE digital copy.

If I want to watch the movie again - I'll add it to my Netflex queue.
