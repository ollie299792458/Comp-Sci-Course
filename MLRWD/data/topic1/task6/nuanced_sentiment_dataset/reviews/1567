Every once in a while, MTV decides it hasn't made enough money playing hip hop and pop videos all day so it will release a movie in an attempt to make a few more dollars. I guess they just take whatever script that their sucker audience will laugh at, not matter how recycled and unoriginal it is. This movie is about some kids who want to steal some S.A.T. answers and pass the test. Of course, they are all stereotypes: the jock, the punk, the rich girl, and so on, but MTV just had to use the stoner. THEY HAD TO USE THE STONER. How many times has that been done? Yeah, the stoner's the comic relief, but be f*cking original. That was done over twenty years ago with "Cheech & Chong". There wasn't really anything to laugh about at all and I am ashamed my friends enjoyed it. I couldn't believe it really; don't they realize they've seen this before? I sure as hell do. And I suggest that if you have any musical taste, you don't listen to anything that gets heavy play on MTV, either.
