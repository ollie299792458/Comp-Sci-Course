I wanted to see this because I actually loved "House on Haunted Hill", I thought it was one of the scariest movies produced recently.  This was a huge disappointment, though.  It is a complete ripoff of "The Ring" (which is much much scarier than both of Malone's) with some tiny changes.  That wouldn't have bothered me THAT much (after all, there is nothing new under the sun, is there?) except that none of the imagery is especially scary either.  Malone uses a similar technique in "Fear" as he did in "House", quick flashes of supposedly shocking, gruesome scenes.  This was very effective in "House", mainly because he lingered just long enough on it for you to register it in your mind.  In "Fear", these flashes have been cut in half, so they come so fast you have no time to figure out what you are looking at, let alone be scared by it.(Maybe I am old-fashioned, but I don't enjoy using freeze-frame to watch a movie frame by frame.)  I kept feeling like I SHOULD be scared, this is a horror movie, isn't it?  But my adrenaline simply never got going and I never could muster enough interest in the story or the characters.  An easily forgettable movie.
