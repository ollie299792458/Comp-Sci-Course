It doesn't match the book in the plot. They turned it into another story between Olan and Wang with the guise of chinese culture and family. Where the movie ended, the book was only in the middle.

SPOILER, contraditictions below

O lan was never given back her pearls. It was the eldest son fooling around not second. there were 3 sons.the eldest son was not "loyal" and did not think of the fire to save locust. the sons did plan to sell the land even after "promising" they would not, while in the movie they did not and promised not to. It was the 3rd son who wanted to be a soldier, not the 2nd. There was no peach tree. O-lan did not agree to have Lotus brought over. major one, Wang HATED his Uncle in the book, in the movie, he likes his Uncle. Wang was not one to just GIVE money to his Uncle, no rather the opposite. He HATED giving money to his Uncle and would NEVER say "oh, how bout 10? 20? coins." O lan was not stepped on during the raid of the rich ppls house. She found the jewels from a lose brick, not just on the ground.

etc.

yep. too much contradictions for me.
