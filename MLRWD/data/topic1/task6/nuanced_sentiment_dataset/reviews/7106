I am not going to talk much about the movie. For the most part I am betting that 90% of the people that read this review already have seen the movie and are wondering if they should add the DVD to their collection. I will just make one note to the commentary featured for the film (the rest of the DVD is what you'd expect).

The director's commentary is supposed to improve the film experience and give insight into either how the film was made or how the story was told or something interesting. The commentary on this DVD has to be some of the worst commentary ever recorded. I can't listen to the Director and his Producers ramble on and on amongst themselves as if they are in a loud, noisy bar. They aren't making any sense, there is no order or purpose to what they are saying. They can't speak in full sentences and they interrupt each other constantly. I literally had to turn off the commentary in order to enjoy the movie. Once it was off, it was an awesome movie.

I wish I had turned it back on during my favorite scene in the movie that takes place at dawn when they encounter the roving band of smugglers or whatever. The background music is perfect (Angel by Massive Attack) and the lighting is perfect. But the commentary was so bad 40 minutes into the film that I could not take it any longer. So just beware about that. Still a great transfer to DVD and if you spent money on a home theater system... this movie will sound great.
