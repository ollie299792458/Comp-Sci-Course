Typical Hitchcock style - an innocent man framed for murder with all the evidence against him and now he has to prove his innocence, even if he has to bend the law by escaping from the gaol. This formula made famous by Hitchcock would be copied countless times and made into numerous movies since this...
This is an all British cast completely devoid of any Hollywood bigwigs who were ruling the roost at that time. This being made during the later years of his movie-making life (his penultimate film actually), Hitchcock also induced small amounts of nudity into this movie which of course blends well into the script and doesn't feel out of place. The fact that body doubles were used was clearly evident though. The parallel plot in the movie where Detective Oxford is being constantly tortured by his wife serving him delicacies like `baked pig foot' was quite humorous.
The DVD as usual like all the other Hitchcock movies in the series `The Alfred Hitchcock Collection' has a documentary on the making of Frenzy and interviews with the surviving cast and support crew. I usually don't see much of the DVD extras but the ones in any Hitchcock DVD is a must since it fills in all the cracks and very informative too.
All-in-all, an entertaining movie, quite out of the league of his earlier movies like 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' or 'North By Northwest', wherein while they all relied on suspense and storylines based on espionage in the times of the Cold War, as times changed, Mr. H did too by making the central thread of Frenzy rely mostly on brutal criminal behavior than anything else.
