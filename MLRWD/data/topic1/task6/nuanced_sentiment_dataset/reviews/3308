Believe it or not, the much discussed "disco-medieval" soundtrack is the least offensive thing about this movie. Actually, I thought it fit well, since this movie is far more enjoyable as a "what were they thinking?!" coked-out 80's big-budget trainwreck...

 I'm a huge fan of the crop of lush, romantic 80's fantasies, but Matthew Broderick's thoroughly un-funny prattling throughout the movie unfortunately upstages much of the more restrained acting by the other leads. Plus, director Richard Donner is clearly not one for continuity, since the movie jumps all over the place, with important scenes being referenced only later in dialogue (I assume they were cut)... I notice at least 3 screenwriters were credited, I either assume that their contributions were either savaged by cut-happy executives, or they were simply completely incompetent to begin with.

I wouldn't even call this film a "fantasy", more of a historical romance. Vittorio Storaro's cinematography is thoroughly 80's, and he's a genius, so rest assured that the picture looks great. Unfortunately, Richard Donner is a Hollywood hack through-and-through, and the motivations of the characters and plot make no sense, and are fairly ludicrous in parts.
