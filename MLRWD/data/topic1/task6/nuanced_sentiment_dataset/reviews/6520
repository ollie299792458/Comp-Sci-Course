This fairly standard WWII pic is saved from banality by the presence of Murphy himself, who brings a first-person immediacy to the story that such films are too often missing.  The "big picture" is provided by an army general who does voice-overs in present-time (that is, 1955, when the film was made) because, as we are reminded repeatedly, a foot soldier doesn't often know why he's doing what he does - just that he's got to do it.  Murphy's performance is spot-on, although the dialogue is often weak, the soundtrack cheesy, and the directing crude by today's standards.  In fact the biggest flaw of this film is really that it's rather dated; few films of the era gave a better, more intimate portrait of a fighting man - but many have been made in the decades since.

There's no room for doubt that Murphy was a fine soldier and a great American, and this outing shows him to be at least a competent actor - but on balance this is not all that great a film.  Because it's based on a real person's experiences, rather than a fictional concept, there's no real story to tell here.  So once you know that Murphy joined the army and didn't get killed, you already know the whole plot.  Absent plot, not to mention character development, what we're left with is kind of a documentary, recounting the exploits of a true American hero, but with such limited historical context that it doesn't make much of an educational tool, either.  Maybe this work can best be understood as a recruiting film; we see men we've come to know shot dead (as the violin music swells) but we never see the kind of gore that causes even the deaths of enemies to haunt men's dreams for the rest of their lives.

If you really like the WWII movies made during the 1950's, this one is certainly worth seeing, even though it may not be worth owning.  On the other hand, if you've grown accustomed to films that portray the "Hell" of war in a more grimly realistic way, then this one may seem puerile and insipid.
