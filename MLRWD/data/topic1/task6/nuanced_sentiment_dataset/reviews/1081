Seriously 4.5 stars? No, seriously?

So if you're not a teenage male who has yet to develop a sense of taste beyond doritos and a variety of microwaved food-like materials in a pocket, this movie is not for you.  But of course, you probably already know that and wouldn't have checked out the reviews on amazon for "13 Assassins" anyway.

So for the teenage males who are considering renting and/or buying this movie, I suggest you are better off checking out "7 Samurai" or even "The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi." In fact, there are probably 10 other samurai flicks better than this.  Just check out Akira Kurosawa's early films (get over the fact they are in B&W, they're great flicks).

Even better, screw samurai flicks altogether and watch Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns.  Same plots but nothing is cooler than Clint. Actually, Clint's character Blondie is probably the coolest character ever in film history. That's right, even Han Solo doesn't measure up (laser guns aren't as cool as a six shooter and a poncho).

Indiana Jones was cool but he was an friggin' anthropologist and that job can't be as cool as the movies made it out to be.

I'm dumber for watching this movie and am glad I didn't sit through the full 141 minutes some of these rubes are complaining this version lacked. Check out the other 2 star reviews because they are pretty efficient at clarifying why this movie sucked.
