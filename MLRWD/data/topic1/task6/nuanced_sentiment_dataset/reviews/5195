When I watch a movie, I accept to get something out of it, but after watching interview I feel let down like I have wasted my time.  I don't mind wasting my time being a person who is perpetually lazy, I do, however, regret having watched this movie.  I had compassion for the main two characters, a journalist and young female celebrity, for they seemed like real people despite their obvious self-destruction and lack of compassion.  Nevertheless, by the end of the movie, I hated not only the two characters featured in this film, I found myself hating humanity a feeling I am not too costumed to because I have been a human for reasonable amount of time, and have found humans most if not almost all to have the capability to love, be emotionally intimate, and grow with interactions of one another.  However, the young female celebrity, Katya, proves at the very last few moments in the film interview to not be able to love, be compassionate, or even be human at all.  Not only is the character Katya unrealistic, but her final actions scared me to the core.  I know that there are sociopaths in the world, but they are rare.  I would even hazard a guess that very few of Hollywood's celebrities are sociopaths.  Therefore, this movie is an interesting view into those few humans that can lie without feeling remorse. Be that as it may, I wouldn't waste my time watching this movie.
