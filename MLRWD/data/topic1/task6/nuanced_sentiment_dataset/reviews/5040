First of all, let me start off by saying this is one of the best B-movies ever put on film. Raimi made a solid movie with a limited budget, forcing him to use cheesy stop-start motion for some of the battle scenes and had to resort to his patented camera tecniques. The story is an original, and Bruce Campbell, no matter what he does in the future (Spiderman 2?) will be forever remembered as Ash, the cocky anti-hero battling for the Book of the Dead.
 That being said, lets talk about the DVD. There are way too many versions out there (at least 5 that I know of), which is upsetting for collectors trying to decide on which one to purchase. I chose this one because it contained the director's cut, with over 15 minutes of cut footage and the original ending. Then I watched it and was horrified. Its fairly easy to tell where these cut 15 minutes occur within the film because they still look unfinished. Grainy would hardly describe how poor the picture quality is. Have you ever watched deleted scenes from any DVD and noticed how the film is darker and unrefined? That's what some parts of this DVD resemble. I won't give away the original ending, but I was also dissapointed with it. If you are a fan of this movie, save yourself some money and buy the Broomstick edition, its a much better investment.
