This poor third installment in The Omen series turns out to be utterly boring and pointless with an even worse ending than the second one.

If you recall the original The Omen, there were 7 crucifix daggers, all of which had to be used in a specific way and shape and on hallowed ground to kill the anti-christ. Without spoiling the ending (not that it's at all possible to spoil it more than the script does), let's just say in this movie that suddenly ceases to be relevant.

The movie for the most part consists of boring sequences in corporate offices, a ridiculous scene in the English woods where a bunch of incompetent priests try to kill Damien, and finally the climax where Damien walks around calling out a challenge to Christ to come face him man on man.

All of this could have been forgiven if the movie at least had some suspense or chill value. It has none - unless you find Sam Neill's Damien ranting to a statue of Christ chilling.

This movie should have been titled "Omen III - The Final Bore". It all ends up being incredibly lame, and the only Omen movie worth watching remains the brilliant original.
