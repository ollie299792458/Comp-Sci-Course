Got this as a joke because my wife's company name is Suburban, so she's my Suburban girl.  The only difference is that we have a far more interesting life than the characters of movie which seems to drag on in parts with bad editing and quickly skips over key points of the plot making for a confusing movie for what is essentially a simple story.  BUT, if you are a 30 Rock fan, you may like some of Alec's acting, for he appears to be the same character to me.  If you are an SNL freak, there is one skit on a show he hosted that did not make any sense to me until I saw this movie.  It is when during the most mundane tasks, the camera zoomed in on his face with extra lighting around his eyes, trying to make the scene more dramatic, like taking a sip of coffee or something.  Well, this movie is chalk full of those scenes, but they're actually meant to be dramatic...
I am afraid I had no idea who Sarah Gellar was until reading the previous review that she is Buffy the Vampire Killer.  Probably not worth renting if you're a Buffy fan, since there is 0 physical action which I believe is an important part of that series.
