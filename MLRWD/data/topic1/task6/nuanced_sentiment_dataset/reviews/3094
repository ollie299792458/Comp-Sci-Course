This review is for the Blu-Ray version of Gojira.  Which Amazon, in its infinite wisdom, has not only bunched the reviews, but the contents of the regular DVD into the description.

I'm torn between liking this and hating this Blu-Ray version.  The picture is tight.  And I mean real tight.  The images on my Sony XBR 34 HD are practically 3D. The lighting, except for some natural blemish, is gorgeous just like the night scenes are beautifully hellish.  It's also cool seeing all the wires (FX) and folds of the G-suit in Blu-Ray tightness.  My complaints are the following:  This print should have been restored.  To have all the lines and scratches on a Blu-Ray transfer just doesn't make sense and makes you feel like you've wasted some cash.  I also believe that even in this "original" Japanese" version there was a scene cut out.  I remember Ogata and crew travelling on a train and Emiko talking about how she survived Nagasaki.  At least I think I saw this in the Realto version when they had a limited release a few years ago in NYC.  I would have also like to have seen some sort of interview, whether made for the DVD or old newsreel clips, of the people who took part in creating the film.  Such as Ishiro Honda, Akira Ifukube and so on.  The extras provided by American fans are actually interesting but it would have been a nice accompaniment to have the real players involved.

That is all.
