I put myself in the intermediate fitness level category.

Pros: Production value is very good.  Instructor(s) are great.  Straightforward and relaxed.  Tiffany narrates and has a nice lower range voice that is not annoying.  Worked up a good sweat.  Nice to see familiar moves throughout the workout (stretch, warmup, workout) coming from a martial arts background.  This is a pro for me but could be a con for beginners --- they have breakdown segments to show the moves but not a serious step by step how-to i.e., how to do a roundhouse kick or hook punch if you are a completely new to this kind of thing.  Worked up a moderate sweat for some of the harder moves.

Cons:  Would be good to be able to select segments to play in a row rather than having to keep selecting each segment to play.  This is a con for me but probably not for others --- While they do give alternatives for limited space, the more room you have, the better for some moves.  Unfortunately, I am working with an extremely limited space that barely fits maybe a couple large yoga mats.  While I worked up a sweat, I am looking for a little more intensity and burn.  Either the time has to go longer, tougher moves, or more of the tougher moves.  Preferably, all 3.

This is more of a traditional martial arts workout --- with kick/punch drills (no real emphasis on just kicking) and basic situps/pushups, no dance or step-tap-step keep-moving-moves --- rather than a kickbox workout as many cardio exercise videos present them so if you are looking for that you will be disappointed.  This workout is also more of a circuit workout (you're up punching, then down on the mat pushups, then up again) than strict cardio like the P90X kenpo so, again, if you want something like that, you will probably be disappointed.
