Whether you're like my wife and I and accumulate another Christmas movie or two every year, or whether you are just putting one DVD in the stocking, the Polar Express is a good choice to add to or start your collection!

Director Robert Zemeckis uses an all-digital technology that captures real-life motion, and all of the latest computer effects to create a visual feast.  The plot is about a doubting young boy who joins a trainful of skeptics for a Christmas Eve journey to the North Pole.  It is a benign, politcally-correct, and fun tale, suitable for children.

The effects will enthrall kids and adults.  The North Pole has a wonderful Northest-USA city of the 1920's look and the train almost steals the show.  Locomotive 1225 (get it?) is a digitalization with real sound recordings from real-life Pere Marquette engine 1225 which escaped the scrapper's torch in part because of that number.

But if there is a show-stealer, it is Tom Hanks, who lends his voice and visage to five characters, most notably the hobo and the conductor.

This isn't the best Christmas film ever made (my vote goes to "the Bishop's Wife" or the George C. Scott version of A Christmas Carol) but Polar Express IS a worthy addition to the pantheon!
