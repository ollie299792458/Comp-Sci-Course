As an Action / Adventure / Military genre film, this one appeared to have decent potential for the first thirty minutes or so:  A small group of soldiers (special forces), a CIA operative returning to Afghanistan, a mysterious and secret Objective... the table was set for an exciting, dramatic, mystery and adventure.

Too bad the film begins to unravel almost immediately after [SPOILER ALERT] the first random character is shot and killed by enemy fighters who fade quite literally into the landscape.  From that point on, everyone is at risk...of being zapped into oblivion by some unknown force, or being shot by the panicking soldiers, or taking their own life due to their overwhelming fear.  Periodically, a new death would shake me awake and engage me for another minute or two, in the false, ultimately unfulfilled hope that I would learn what force of nature was at work here.  Suffice it to say that we never really learn anything...except that having a story line is not a prerequisite for a feature film.  Fools like me will continue to watch a picture that has, after the first forty five minutes, already disappointed.

If you're thinking about this one, don't make the mistake I did.  Choose sleep.
