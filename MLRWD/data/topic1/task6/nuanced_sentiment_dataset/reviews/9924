The plot in short is things from inside the earth see humans as corrupt and evil, and thus must be eliminated so the DC super heroes come to stop it. The Film does star Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, but focuses Green Lantern who gets his ring in the film, Martian Manhunter who comes to earth in the film, and Flash who the fait of the earth depends on.
You may ask "are all the heroes on the cover in the movie?" and the answer is pretty much. I remember seeing most of them, but a few I did not see. I may have over looked them since other than the main heroes there roles are usually brief and non-speaking. For example Speedy and Wonder Girl are only in a picture of the Teen Titans when they are showing a bit of the future in the end of the movie.
Now a big question you may have is "why is it PG-13?" I think it has some thing to do with them trying to get animation more respect and make it not thought of as a medium limited to children only. I say this since they could have easily made this a PG. The rating was dew to some scenes like when Wonder Woman wrecks her invisible plane and there is blood everywhere (although she goes to the medic and comes out with a cast on her arm and not even a scratch other than that), and when they fight the monsters from under ground they basically splatter them (It is not as gory as it sounds). And people do say "son of a b****" twice. So if you show this to children watch it first.
But for that I take off one star, since the great story, acting, and animation in this should get at least 4 stars. For anyone over 13 I recommend it, anyone under I think it is probably best to wait a few years.
