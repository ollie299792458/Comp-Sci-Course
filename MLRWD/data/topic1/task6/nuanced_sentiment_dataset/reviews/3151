I thought they did a great job with this DVD considering the source. The picture quality didn't match a modern movie, but I didn't expect that. I thought it looked great for a 70's TV show. The sound was servicable, which all you can expect from something this old. They also did a good job with the commentary, which covered all six episodes.
  The actual story was another matter. There were some great performances (especially by Louis Gossett Jr. as Fiddler), but there were a few I could have done without, like Sandy Duncan and whoever played that poor white guy starting with episode five. They featured too many unbelievable coincidences, which means lazy writing to me. The show also looked claustrophobic after episode one , no doubt because of budget constraints. (That  snow in episode two looked like the result of an overflowing washing machine.)It looked like they were in one spot for the remaining five episodes. As far as a story about slavery, it hit the high points but didn't go into much depth. (I guess that shouldn't be a complaint; this wasn't on the History channel.) For its time it might be five stars, but not now.
