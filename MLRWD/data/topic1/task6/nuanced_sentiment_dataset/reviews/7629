This was Douglas Trumball's triumph!  He had just finished making 2001 and got on with a specialaized project with Universal to be able to make movies on a fixed budget.  He was able to make a movie that still stands up today as an effects triumph.  Despite his limited budget he was able to make a movie with Robots that I had to see to believe how they were done.
The most important thing in this movie is the message.  Earth is a fragile thing and that our resources and space are not limitless nor boundless.  IN the end, we may have forests in little domes in space wondering where we went wrong on earth.  The idea that even these last vestages of life would be destroyed is interesting and considering the present corprate mentality of the bottom line or nothing, is plausable.
The logos and advertising by American Airlines and other corporate entities gives the film a realistic flavor.  Trumball did his best to convey that.  Such was present in the use of the Valley Forge, a WWII aircraft carrier that was in the process of being scrapped.  Varous sections of the ship were modified and utilized as set pieces and rooms on a vast spacecraft.  So much so, as a child when I saw this film, I thought they had actualy filmed it on location!
This was Trumballs film all the way.  Although Stephen Bochco and others appear as the writing credits, Trumball eventually had to throw out all their writing and write the film himself, but because he was not a member of the Writers Guild, did not get credit for his work.
All in all, an excellent film that I hope that todays youth, with their jaded, computer-graphic, perfect mindset, can understand and hopefully see the message that the worst can STILL happen.
