In my opinion the film-maker did a really good job transforming Steinbeck's novel "Of mice and men" into a movie.

The actors are well chosen, for example John Malkovic acts very well as Lennie Small.

There 's the right mixture of action and humor in the film and the mood of the novel is captured very well.  The movie sticks very closely to the book, but that doesn't mean that it only retells the story - it does more. On the one hand there are some scenes which don't happen in the movie, but on the other hand some parts of the movie are not mentioned in the book: the right mixture.

The director has managed to tell the story really authentically:

George and Lennie, two guys who both have the dream to have a ranch of their own, are starting to work at a ranch, because they need money.

You can say that Lennie is a really poor guy: He 's a nice person and always has good intentions, but unfortunately he always gets himself into trouble. Without George, who always helps him out of these problems, Lennie would be stranded.

George and Lennie make some friends at their new job, but also some enemies. As Lennie accidentally kills the wife of their boss's son, the story has to end dramatically. George kills Lennie, so that the other people and Curley won 't lynch Lennie.
