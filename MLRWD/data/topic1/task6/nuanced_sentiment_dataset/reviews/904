This film is about a woman from Pasadena named Susan (played by our favorite friend, Jennifer Aniston). As an adult, she's moved to New York and gotten engaged to a guy named Jeff (played by the ubiquitous Mark Ruffalo). She and Jeff fly back to Pasadena to attend her little sister's wedding. Very soon she finds herself getting entwined with the mysterious relationship that took place in the 1960s between her deceased mother and a man named Beau Burroughs (played by Kevin Costner). She is further shocked when she discovers that Burroughs might be her real father, and that his exploits with her mother and grandmother might have been the inspiration behind the story of The Graduate.

This movie disturbed me to my very soul. I really don't want to give away what happens, but there is a somewhat incestuous undertone that is being passed off as a funny, unfortunate circumstance. I am very sorry, but there is NOTHING funny or entertaining about incest, especially when it is placed in a movie that is supposed to be lighthearted and clever.

Another thing that irritated me is the ending. Once again, I don't want to give too much away, but there are absolutely no consequences for the horrible deceit someone commits against someone else. I don't see how this movie could have ended as happily as it did when disgusting and deceitful things took place.

The only thing that saved this movie from just one star is the fact that it took place in Pasadena, my favorite city in L.A.
