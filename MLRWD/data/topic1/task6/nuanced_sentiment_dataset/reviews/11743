There are some films, books and musicals that rise much higher than the sum of their parts: they have an almost mystical ability to seize the viewer/reader and pull them into a different world. South Pacific is part of this genre for me. Forget about the color filters, the nitpicks on the casting, the awkwardness of the dubbing, etc. -- watch the movie and see if the sum of the parts doesn't pull you in. Make yourself a Mai Tai, park your family on the couch and prepare to be transported. I'll be the first to admit that a critic's eye and ears will find significant flaws with this movie - but to dwell on these flaws is to miss the big picture. I'm sure I've seen several hundred movies in my life - and many had better acting, cinematography and sound than this movie - but only a small handful (the first Star Wars, the first Matrix, Cold Mountain, Gone With the Wind, Cassablanca) truly pulled me completely into the movie. There is no magic recipe of genre, acting, cinematography or story line that guarantees this kind of immersion -- some films just have "it" - and this one does.
