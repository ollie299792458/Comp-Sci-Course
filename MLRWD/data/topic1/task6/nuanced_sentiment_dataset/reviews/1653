I recall seeing Cocoon when it was first released abd thinking highly of it; seeing it again only confirmed my original opinion. The cast is replete with accomplished names: Wilford Brimley, Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy, Don Ameche, Maureen Stapleton, Gwen Verdon, and others; yet I continue to cherish especially the restrained, mature performance of Brian Dennehy above all others. The film deals with an issue all of us will eventuallly face: whether to "go gentle into that good night" and accept gracefully the inevitable limitations of ageing and death, or to "rage, rage against the coming of the night," or, as an earlier potet expressed it, "whether to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them." Sharpened by creative fantasy, the ancient conundrum plays out pointedly here. An excellent and provocative film that  brings many plaudits to its fine cast, its accomplished director, Ron Howard, and to all involved. Having an up-to-date version is a real delight.
