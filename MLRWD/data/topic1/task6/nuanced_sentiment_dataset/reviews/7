Hilarious!  This movie throws in all kitchen sinks... then adds the bathroom sink... then returns to the kitchen to throw in more kitchen sinks!!

Here's kind of what happens:

Some lady has a tumor growing on her neck... naturally it turns out to be the fetus of a reincarnated evil indian medicine man.

An old lady becomes possessed and floats down the hallway... and then is thrown out the window by unseen Manitou.  A seance occurs,  a head rises up out of a table... then sinks back into the table.

Finally good medicine man and Tony Curtis (!) battle evil Manitou in the hospital room after it's born/ripped out of the woman's back.

Supernatural battles occur... Manitou is winning.  Tony Curtis and Medicine Man are about to give up... that's when an earthquake hits the hospital.  Naturally evil Manitou has summoned "The Great Old One" - aka Satan.  I guess since evil Manitou was already winning he needed help from The Great Old One??

Tony Curtis and Medicine Man return for another round against evil Manitou...

It goes without saying that everyone and everything has it's own Manitou -- including typewriters.  Medicine Man summons the Manitous of all the machines (!) in the building and focuses their energy against evil Manitou.

"Machine Manitous -- hear me, send evil Manitou back to the time of times!"

By the way... at this point Evil Manitou has turned the hospital room into OUTER SPACE!!  But you probably guessed that since it only follows.

Medicine Man isn't having that much success focusing the machine manitous.  So naturally what happens is the dead woman comes to life, is topless and zaps evil Manitou out of existence.

That's when Satan gets into a laser battle with dead topless women.  Also, Satan throws meteors at her.  Finally dead topless woman zaps Satan into nothingness.

Pure genious!  I'd say go out and immediately rent it... but instead this movie must be bought so it can be carefully studied over and over again!
