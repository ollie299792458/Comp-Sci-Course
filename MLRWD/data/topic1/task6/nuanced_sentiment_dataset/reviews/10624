Sorry, but this must clearly be the most a..inine action movie ever made. Nothing makes sense in this flic, the viewer has to watch the same incident over and over again. If you enjoy things like this , get "Crash", a truly great one, but please stay away from vantage point. How the otherwise excellent cast has been coerced into signing up for this film is beyond me (did the Spanish Tourism Office pay them off?). The movie starts with a TV crew and their reporter in the crowd. She gets blown up and everyone is shocked, but nowhere is this thread being taken up again towards the end and the "unravelling" of the plot. There really is not much of a plot. A long unbelievable car chase, that is about it. Lordhavemercy, how could this one be produced. Get yourself a good comic book and you will have more fun. I am stuck in a town called Swords in Ireland where there is nothing to do after work except pub or mall, and I ended up wasting 6 Euro on this baby, please, dont make this mistake too.Sorry, fans.
