Tries to be hip and fails miserable. From start to finish I felt like I had seen this movie before with better actors, writing, and direction, and I was correct. The entire plot is stolen from a combination of The Bank Job and Heat right down to shoot out at some airport where they must not worry about cars, automatic weapon fire, or baggage checking. The scenes they did steal were horribly acted and the scenes they did not were comically predictable.

For example, there is this sub-plot where the typical always angry police captain is being ignored by an angry, misunderstood, dedicated detective (played by Matt Dillon) only to find out that the chief was hounding him to warn him that his partner was videotaped by vice, stealing drug money and letting a suspect go. "I just thought you should know who your working with." says the captain. I guess arresting, or even chastising, the bad cop was not an option. Oh, and wouldn't you know it, he's misunderstood too. It is movies like these that make me pray that some day I will be able to sue for the time and money that I will never get back. We can only hope!
