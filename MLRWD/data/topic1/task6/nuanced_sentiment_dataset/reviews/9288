The Last Unicorn, is the story about the las unicorn in the world. It's a beautiful fairy tale, that does not have a happy ending.
The Unicorn after (hearing a man saying that she was the last, and talking to a butterfly about the Red Bull. )

On her way she meets Mommy Fortuna a witch who captures her, and keeps her in her carnival.
 However, the unicorn does not stay her long. Schmendrick the witches magician saves the unicorn and he goes along with her on her journey.
Schmendrick gets 'kidnaped' more or less and he meets Caption Cully and his men. There he makes appear Robin Hood with his magic. The men are no longer amused by this and they tie him up to a tree.
The magician does a foolish spell and makes the tree come to life. The Unicorn saves him and they soon continue on their journey, this time accompanied by Cully's cook Molly.

However, the poor Princes only learns that the women he loves is a unicorn.
A beautiful gem of a movie with an ending that doesn't usually happen. While a good movie the DVD format is awful. I would either order it over seas in the UK or wait 'till it's re-lease in March to get it.
