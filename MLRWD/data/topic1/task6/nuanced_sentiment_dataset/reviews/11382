I thoroughly enjoyed the first Bad Boys movie.  It had an interesting storyline, believable character development, witty dialogue and tense action sequences.  It certainly wasn't intellectually stimulating, but as far as action movies go it was very well done.

Needless to say, I was very excited when I heard about Bad Boys II.  But as I watched the movie, I kept waiting for the storyline to be explained, waiting for the witty dialogue to come up, and most of all, waiting to be entertained.  Instead, this movie has seemingly no plot at all.  Nothing is explained, even at the end.  You have no idea what the protagonists are trying to accomplish, who the antagonists are and what their motivation is.  There is also zero character development.  None of the characters grow or change at all during the course of the movie.  It's just action sequence upon action sequence, interspersed with crass, sophomoric dialogue that's apparently supposed to pass for humor.

In summary, this movie was a COLLOSSAL dissappointment.  It doesn't even have a fragment of what made the first movie so great.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this one at all costs.
