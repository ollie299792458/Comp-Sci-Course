I love this movie. I bought the first release of the DVD without a single feature on it, just so I could watch it over and over. It was the first DVD I bought when I got my player.

I almost fell over with joy when I saw the "Everything's Duckie" edition at Best Buy yesterday. I could barely contain my excitement. FINALLY, I would get to see the ending that John Hughes intended- where Andie (Molly Ringwald) ends up with sweet, lovable Duckie (Jon Cryer) instead of smarmy, sappy richie "major appliance" Blane (Andrew McCarthy).

THE ORIGINAL ENDING IS NOT ON THIS DVD. That is a total rip-off. It says in plain English, on the list of features "Original Ending". Instead of showing it, they talk about it and why it didn't work.

It sounds like the real reason they changed the ending was that Molly Ringwald had the hots for Andrew McCarthy. And if the test audience booed, then they sure as hell didn't show it to a group of high school outcasts.

When the scene wasn't in the special feature, I even went so far as to watch the end of the movie thinking maybe they had actually put it in the feature. But no. For the one hundreth time, I had to watch Duckie make eyes at a rich girl with big boobs (Kristy Swanson, pre-Buffy the Vampire Slayer), and Andie make out with Sap-face in the parking lot.

Dang.

The other features are pretty cool. There are a lot of interviews and stuff. But you can't call it the "Duckie Edition" if she doesn't end up with Duckie. Period.
