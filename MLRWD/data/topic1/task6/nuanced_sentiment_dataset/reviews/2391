I have a vision of Hell.
There I am, sitting quietly. And before me is a huge TV screen. And I am condemned to watch this movie for the rest of my days.
It's not so much that this movie completely deviated from the plot of Homer's epic poem. It DID do that. It's not so much the fake, fake effects. They were fake. It's not so much the ridiculous, farcical acting. Which it was, much to my dismay (I admire Irene Papas very much but she was simply pulled under by the miserable script). It's not even so much the ridiculous costumes. And they were ridiculous. It is most definitely the script that it the final insult. The weak, weak script barely managed to hold together any semblance of a plot.
The casting? Absolutely ridiculous. Bernadette Peters as a seductress? The same woman who was the witch in Into the Woods?
And Telemachus? The worm with a unibrow? If that man is good-looking then I weep for the male gender.
Poseidon appearing in the waves? Like the Wizard of OZ? And Aiolos the wind god as a portly, obnoxious little voluptuary from Brooklyn? No matter how hard you hurl a spear, the people you hit with it WILL NOT FLY INTO THE AIR AND STICK TO THE WALL. The last movie that was as bad as this was Dragonheart. As the final scene ended, and the credits began to roll, I felt violated. I felt more violated still as I realized that Francis Ford Coppola was responsible for this miserable, painful, heart-wrenching movie. The same man who gave us the Godfather raped us with this piece of excrement??? True, he did make the Godfather III, but that pales in comparison to the extreme BADNESS of this movie.
