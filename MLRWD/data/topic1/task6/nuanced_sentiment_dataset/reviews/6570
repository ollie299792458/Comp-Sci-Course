This film is definitely what I would call a feel good movie. I came away from it feeling that there are decent people in this world and that we are not all disappearing into the obscurity of just a name on a piece of paper.  
The story follows Jerry Maguire, played by Tom Cruise, falling from  grace working for a sports star agency when he has a flash of inspiration  and takes the moral high ground on the way people should be treat within  the company. His eventual rise to becoming a better person is aided from  the love of woman and her son and the realization that everyone who he  represents should be treated with the same respect.
The person that stole  the show for me was Cuba Gooding Jr. Every scene he was in made me laugh.  This was the first movie I had seen him in and thought he was a terrific  actor, deserved of the Oscar he won for Best Supporting Actor. The "Show Me  The Money" scene will have you in stitches.
This is not a DVD that is to  be bought for it's technical qualities or abundance of extras. All you get  is a static menu with no trailer, character biographies or other extras. In  this day and age of DVD's like "Contact" and "The Matrix" I would have  expected a bit more from a quality movie like this. The picture quality is  good, as is the sound but it certainly won't tax your Dolby Digital  amplifier, but then again it is not expected to.
Jerry Maguire is a film  to cuddle up to your partner with and watch on a cold rainy night. It is  funny, poignant and thought provoking. Worth watching at least  once.
