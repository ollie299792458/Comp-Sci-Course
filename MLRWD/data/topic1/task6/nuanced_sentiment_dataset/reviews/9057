I see people blaming this movie on AMERICA. . .And being racist, that's funny cause when i saw this movie i found it in no way racist you guys who think it is need to chill out a little bit because it is a parody, there was no racial motivation all they did was stereotype rich white girls, and i'm sure alot of you people are guilty yourselves of sterotyping black people as "thugs" or "gangstars", and i was in no way even inclined to believe this was racist.  But i suppose if you find this racist then to each his own.  Now as for blaming america for this movie that is just stupid.  The american people on a whole are not resposible for this movie, and i know pleanty of americans who are not ignorant and it seems to me that by calling americans igonorant you are doing, in fact what you disliked about this movie which is stereotyping.  Anyways i hope you all found this review useful, more of a lecture but it had to be said.  This movie was alright but i have seen better, it seemed like a rip off of the movie "Sorority boys" where men dressed as women.  Only difference was that "Sorority Boys" was alot funnier.  I would not reccomend you see the movie but its your choice 
Peace
