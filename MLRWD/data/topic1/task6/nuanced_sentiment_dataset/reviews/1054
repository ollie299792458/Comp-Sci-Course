The movie is great.  What more can be said?
Well, I'll tell you.  I bought this DVD to replace my aging VHS tape.  The tape actually sounds BETTER!  When Universal had the initial master made, the level of the bass track wasn't right.  When T-Rex walks, you're supposed to FEEL it.  The VHS tape (in THX) and the Digital Dolby DVD both have the bass level set properly.
What did they do?  They made a new master (after six months).  They did NOT recall the bad DVDs from distributors.  The new DVDs are available (they sound great), but VERY hard to locate.  They also didn't change the UPC on the case, so there's no way to tell which DVD you're buying, until you open it up.  Finally, they didn't tell anyone that a mistake had been made, so that it could be corrected.  In short, they didn't so ANYTHING that might cost them one cent.
How do you tell the difference (other than sound)?  The bad DVD has a code of 'D2R1' on the inner rim of the disk.  The good DVD has a code of 'D2R2' in the same place.
