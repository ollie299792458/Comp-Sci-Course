This is the story of a bunch of swordfish fishermen going out to sea to hopefully catch some fish and make some hard core money that would be enough to LIVE ON. But when they go out they fish they face all kinds of challenges from being hooked on to getting strange fish (only hints-not giving it away). The biggest one however is when they get home and learn there is a Hurricane in there way, so the crew has to choose between loosing their catch or making a run for it. The crew choose to make a run and it turn out disastriously (not giving it away). The acting is excellent by everyone especially Clooney, which kept the movie real and interesting. The plot is displayed excellently with tons of twist and turns to keep the viewer interested. The drawback that made me take some points of is that the first 20 minutes of mainly bar scenes and small talk isn't really to captiviating (with the exception of the father-son scene). But other than that, this movie is exciting, and whether ya seen it before or haven't you'll want to see it now.
