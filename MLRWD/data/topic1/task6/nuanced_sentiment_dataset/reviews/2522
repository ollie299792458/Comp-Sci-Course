This is not about defective dvd's(they're not) or about "What I think of the Moonlighting series" but is rather what I thought of Season 3.  I don't have to repeat the characters,stars,or basic premise, there's already plenty of that in other reviews.

  Those new to Moonlighting need to know that this is the year the series took a real sharp turn. The egos of the stars were clashing, and always in the news. It was reported each star was refusing to show up for filming, wouldn't act together, and other tantrums. Clearly, story lines had to be written and rewritten to detour around the feud. It is Season 3 that Herb Viola is introduced as a love interest for Miss Depesto. They soon garner a greater and greater presence in the show. At times, the 2 stars are relegated essentially to doing cameos. I believe this was a cheap tactic intended only to hide the fact that the stars were appearing less and less. Personally, I did not tune in to see Herb and Agnes.  It was also during this season that Maddie appeared to "pick up" Sam(Mark Harmon) and sleep with him. I thought this very much out of Maddie's character. Soon after, when Cybill became pregnant- her pregnancy was written into the show for Maddie.

  While some found these substantial changes merely continuing a storyline, I thought them too contrived, and it appeared to me that instead of writing for the spirit and mood of the characters so popular in Season 1 and 2, these storylines strayed too far from the original to accommodate the stars' ego, merely to keep pumping out episodes of the show.  Purists and collectors will want all seasons of course, but for those who purchase this merely to watch and enjoy, I recommend buying only seasons 1-3.
