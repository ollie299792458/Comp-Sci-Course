We almost didn't go see this because critics and many reviewers on the web are talking negatively about this movie. We went and were happy we did. Is it the very best cop buddy movie ever made? Maybe not, but it's funny, entertaining and at times very exciting. This movie is definitely worth viewing, and it's better than some of the other stuff being released lately.

You can't really go wrong with Bruce Willis, and this style of humor combined with action really suits him. There was room for some more depth in his acting, but my guess is that the director didn't want him to go any deeper. He's obviously fully capable of that. Tracy Morgan is enjoyable as Willis' partner. Is Tracy the best actor ever? Well, you know the answer to that, but the guy is really funny. He puts it all out there for a laugh, and it's fun to watch. Surprisingly, Willis and Morgan have some really good buddy chemistry together in this flick.

There were some laugh out loud funny moments, but much of the film was smile on your face funny. The serious moments did draw me in, though it wasn't the most intense film ever. The pace is slow at times, but the entertaining and exciting parts make up for that. I'd say this movie is worth seeing in the theater or even on DVD.
