It's hard not to like the subject matter of this movie, and I've enjoyed the movie immensely over the years, but recently I've begun to understand the film in a new and less flattering way.

Paul Newman, who was simply one good looking fellow, plays the part of an aimless war veteran who finds himself doing two years on a chain-gang (road work) as sentence for destroying public property. The release year of this film reflects it's content - Hollywood was busy pushing aside film heroes like Jimmy Stewart who reflected and performed to traditional American values, and instead was promoting the anti-hero; for example, James Dean.

Dialogue in this film when Newman's character, Luke, is conversing with his mother is a mishmash best understood as the screenwriter trapped between the wish to throw old conventions aside, and his fear that going too far would alienate the paying public.

This film is leftism trying to emerge from the shellacking it took when The American Way emerged triumphant from World War II. Vietnam and Nixon's resignation would provide all the cover leftist needed to fully emerge out from under their rocks. I've come to understand now that much of Newman's career was employed in posing as the palatable anti-hero for a nation not yet ready to embrace that which is vile without excuse or embarrassment.
