I almost feel like repenting for the review I am about to write.  This movie was just downright bad.  The music was great, but sad to say it was nothing new - except Yolanda Adams' song "Victory".  All of the other songs were at least 2-3 years old.  Now for the movie, I was excited when I saw the previews, especially since this was a Rainforest film directed by Rob Hardy.  I was all hyped up to know that the guys who have served up the smut were now embarking on "The Gospel" - Hallelujah!!!  Rainforest Films is notorious for cutting edge drama and what better a forum to dish dirt than the black church.  However, what I witnessed was a poorly acted, poorly scripted, incomplete story line and a choppy end product that kept jumping around.  I could never quite grasp the emotions of the characters and felt that the tension was unexplained.  Sadly, Boris Kodjoe was just Boring.  Ms. Gray was loopy and did not have enough "umph" for an Easter speech, much less being a leading lady.  Sadly, I was very disappointed along with the other long-faced viewers who left the movie theatre with me.  The one shining star in this movie was good ole' Donnie McClurkin.  Thankfully, he had enough personality and presence to save the day.  Now Boris may have have broad shoulders, but not broad enough to hold up this film.  Rainforest, think about a Trois 4, and I may return to see what you have to offer.
