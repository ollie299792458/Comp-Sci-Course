The main problem with this in not the story. Its the filming.  Everything is a close-up and the camera angle is constantly changing.  Where Good Fellas and Casino are famous for the Longest continuous camera shots, this one should be equally famous for the shortest.  
The camera shifts without reason every fraction of a second.  Everything is a closeup.  When a group of people are talking together.  Split seconds of facial closeups are mixed with facial closeups of the other characters talking.
Actually its worse than that, you get close-ups of eyes, then someones nose, then back to Stallone talking, Stallone at a different angle, at yet another angel, a close-up of finger tapping.  
Its like they had 1000 cameras for every scene and used portions of each one for every minute of screentime. 
If you can get past how absurdly it is shot, you have absurd situations like a racer getting upset taking off in one of these cars on public city streets and being pursued by another racer.  Also in a race, there is a crash, and the other racer does a 180 degree turn and goes to rescue him.
I could never get past all this to get deep enough into the relationships between the characters so I can't comment about that.
This movie is terrible.
