Boogie Nights is an entertaining movie, but not a fantastic one. While Burt Reynolds and of course Don Cheadle are solid choices for their roles, the film hinges largely on the performance and natural charisma of Wahlberg, who is possibly the only actor who could even be imagined in this role without risking his career. Claims that the story is based on that of John Holmes are nothing but publicity to give it more legitimacy than a completely fictional narrative about the porn industry, which is really what it is. Wahlberg's character bears no specific resemblance to Holmes whatsoever, and the narrative is entirely generic of its topic: pool parties, drug use, filming porn scenes. The "big package" schtick is too repetitive and overdone, and in fact is the main drama of the entire film: Will we get to see it after witnessing the jaw-dropping over-reactions of nearly everyone else who appears on screen, or not? Such tension. Wahlberg's persona is portrayed as overly stupid, almost appearing to have a significant mental impairment, and with minimal comic advantage. His total wide-eyed gullibility gets tiring, but is balanced somewhat by the grittier drug deal scenes in the second half of the film. 
Although this film does have its moments and is worth watching overall, it is not a legendary cinematic achievement.
