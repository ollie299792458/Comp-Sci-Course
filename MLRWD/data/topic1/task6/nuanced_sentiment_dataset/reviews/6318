I'm a rom-com junkie who's mighty frustrated with the genre--how can most of these films be sub-par? doesn't that go against the rules of statistics?--and yet I must say I was pleasantly surprised by The Switch.  It's a cut above the norm, mostly because of the relationship between father and son, which is warmly, sweetly, comedically and endearingly acted.

This film is Hollywood; despite a strange lull after the "switch" which suggests the pacing might go indie, it returns to Hollywood momentum.  Which is fine, but the editing is slightly off there.  That said, the charm and comedy of the father and son really do make this movie.  I'm not into the standard manipulation of cute faces and piping voices for ratings, but these two are really sweet magic together.

Bateman's acting is touchingly understated when he's with the kid; the child (Thomas Robinson) is earnest and adorable and is so natural in his connection with his father.  Aniston picks up credibility in a few of the intimate moments she has with Bateman--you feel her looking at him and being moved and wanting/wondering--but overall this really is a Bateman/Robinson movie.

I don't dislike Aniston in general, but I absolutely didn't "feel" her the way I did the other two.  The movie has the usual Hollywood stock characters for best friends; Jeff Goldblum is amusing in a slightly quieter way than usual. But it's Bateman and Robinson, as a duo and separately, that make the movie a four star in its genre--and that make you long for the Bateman/Aniston characters to live happily ever after.

I rented it thinking it would be bad fluff.  I watched it half-over again later that night, just to laugh and love a bit more with the father/son duo, and now I'm going to buy it for real.  This isn't going to be the best romantic comedy you'll have ever watched (I hope), but it's not at all a bad way to spend a couple hours. :)
