Season three was certainly the most intriguing of 'Angel'. After the events that occured in the previous season, Darla returns to inform Angel that she is pregnant with his child... Yeah. This season is full of surprises that actually surprise. The real drama doesn't even start until Angel's son Connor is actually born, but is then thought to play a part in what else but the apocalypse. Wesley betrays the group by stealing Connor only to have him taken away to a dimension where he grows up quite quickly and returns to this world as a young man. The characters go through some changes this season. We see both Angel and Cordelia take on roles as parental figures for the young Connor and Fred and Gunn's relationship begins to strengthen. Both 'Buffy' and 'Angel' season finales normally provide closure so this finale comes as a huge shock. Connor locks his father into a metal box and sinks him into the bottom of the ocean... Ouch. This is a great season of 'Angel' with so much depth in its characters.
