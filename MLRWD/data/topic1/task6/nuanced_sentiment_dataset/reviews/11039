My highest recommendation!  Eternal Sunshine is STILL more original and relevant than [almost] anything/everything that's followed, and there's even some passing parallels to Faulkner for those who enjoy intellectual exercises that go deeper than subtext. It won a [well-deserved] Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, and while the screenplay can certainly stand on its own, what REALLY sets this film apart is how the script embraces the medium of film while simultaneously redefining the medium... and / or the process.

The title is a deliberate allusion to Alexander Pope's "Eloisa to Abelard," about a tragic love affair in which the heroine's happiness is inversely proportional to her memory:

  How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!
  The world forgetting, by the world forgot.
  Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!
  Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd;

The theme is universal enough (Ignorance is bliss, eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, etc., etc.), but filtered through the mind of Charlie Kaufman, the impossible is not only plausible, its practical!  But is it preferable?

If you've never seen it, it may take a while for things to make sense, but if you watch it twice, back to back, I have no doubt you'll thoroughly enjoy the film.  The understated brilliance of Kaufman's screenplay becomes more and more apparent with subsequent (third, fourth, etc.) viewings.

Oh - and if you were looking for a review that tells you what the movie is ABOUT, Wikipedia does that rather well.
