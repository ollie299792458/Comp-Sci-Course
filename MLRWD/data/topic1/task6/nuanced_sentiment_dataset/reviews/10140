I'm a big fan of Renee Zellweger and HCJ, so I was expecting a lot from this film. Alas it was not meant to be.

The idea of a glamorous city executive (Zellweger) coming to a small town to downsize a company and butting heads with the local union rep (HCJ) is an excellent one. There was so much potential here for a really sharp romantic comedy, but it basically fell completely flat. Why? IMO because it didn't want to tackle the real issues surrounding downsizing and corporate greed, so it went the way of condescending stereotypes and tired romcom cliches.

Zellweger goes from being a brittle corporate drone to someone with a conscience in the blink of an eye, and there are only a few lame scenes with her & HCJ before they are in lurve. There's no sparring or witty repartee to draw the reader in, or any attempt to build sexual tension. The dialogue is unbelievable and the film consists of very short scenes that don't allow you to connect with the characters. The icy landscape is very fitting because Zellweger's face is frozen throughout the entire movie, but maybe that was through embarassment at being in such a dud, and not a botox treatment gone wrong.
