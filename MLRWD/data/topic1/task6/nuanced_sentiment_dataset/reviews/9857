Simply outstanding!  Every now and then, God creates a near perfect human being:  a beautiful voice that is beyond beyond, a beautiful face with a winning smile, a beautiful body that is dressed in facinating choices of style, a beautiful and engaging talent with the NERVE to put it all together and give it all back to us, the audience.  If anyone gives this album less than 5 stars, there is something seriously lacking with them.  Sarah, obviously, works hard on perfecting her talent.  She doesn't just sing, she takes us on her trip--and a magical experience it is.  Sarah's songs are not just sung, they are performed by one who hits every note right on and remembers every word of very complex music.  The La Luna album has a little bit of something for everyone.  It is a wonderful mixture of songs that remain in your head long after Sarah has sung them.  Watching her on this album, I now understand the meaning of "visual candy."  This album makes a wonderful gift for anyone with taste.  Try it; you'll get chills on the back of your neck, she sings so awesomely.
