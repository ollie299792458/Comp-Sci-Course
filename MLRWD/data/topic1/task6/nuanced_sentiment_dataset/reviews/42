I love season 6 of The Simpsons. It really is my favorite in the entire series (Season 5 is a close second). I give the season a definite 5/5, it is perfection. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about these discs. Cheap packaging and cheap DVD-roms were used or someone should at least be fired for the transfer quality to DVD. I recently purchased this season for the 2nd time as my first set, the one with Homer's individual cut-out head and the packaging on that one fell apart about a month later and there is a lot of pixelation and random parts where the episode would just freeze and then jump forward about 5 minutes. Now I bought the box form of this season and the packaging is almost the same and is already showing that it might fall apart. So far the episodes are playing normally but when I watch the episodes with the Commentary (something I love listening to on DVDs or BluRays) it will do the pixelating/freezing thing. Seriously, I don't know who Fox went with for these sets but please please please don't let them do anymore of these! This is ridiculous!
