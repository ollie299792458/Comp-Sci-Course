Kevin Bacon plays a a recently paroled pedophile who tries to adapt to a normal life--- getting a job at a lumber yard and trying to keep his past hush-hush.  He lives in an apartment right across the street from a grade school where he observes a potential pedophile attempting to entice the young ones with candy. While this subplot is occurring he is exorcising his pedophiliac tendencies with a very nubile Kyra Sedgewick. Mos Def's cop is also trailing him like a bad fart letting him know he's got all eyes on him at all times.  Eventually Kevin Bacon meets a young Robin, an 11-yr. old girl, who was also molested by her father and he suppresses his continued deviant advances upon hearing her story.  He takes out his inner rage and his fists on the local neighborhood pedophile and eventually moves out and attempts to reconcile with his sister to no avail.  Kevin Bacon played the role of the little-too sympathetic ex-pedophile well, but the movie just seemed too contrived and glossed over much of the after-effects of child molestation from the victim's perspective.
