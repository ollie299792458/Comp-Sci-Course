I've got to be honest: I've seen the series on HULU.  I probably won't watch this again until much later when I don't have classes to worry about, but I think this series is worth buying.  The television is now filled with the same cop shows, the same legal dramas, the same reality shows that aren't real.  It's very refreshing to watch a show with an intricate plot that hasn't been seen in a very long time.

I've read all of the Old Testament and most of the New Testament before.  I was raised and am a practicing Catholic.  But I have to admit, knowing the references is both a blessing and a curse.  As a student of literature, it's nice to know what they're talking about--it made me appreciate the research they've done.  However, as a fan of mystery, I'd like twists to come as a surprise.  Either way, you don't need to be a Christian or to read the Bible to appreciate the story.

I'm very much upset to find out that this show was cancelled.  Even though writers and producers have tried to provide a conclusion to the show, it wasn't enough.  I was left hungry for more.  I do hope that someone would pick this show up and put it back on air.  It would be such a waste not to.
