The acting was good and there were a few amusing moments.  However, I'm very tired of movies that are not realistic and have things happen that seem impossible without even trying to explain how they might be possible if it is inconvenient for the plot.  Maybe I nodded off and missed it, but did they ever explain how Rachel Weisz got away with the book?  Am I just supposed to be so amused by her cute little dance that I don't care how?  Speaking of nodding off, the movie wasn't interesting enough to justify it's nearly 2 hour running time.  Don't read my last beef if you haven't watched the movie.  Hollywood has a long tradition of characters getting shot and acting like it doesn't hurt.  Emergency room doctors have told stories of teenage gang members who get shot and are stunned about how much it actually hurts.  Movies make them think getting shot hurts about as much as a punch in the mouth.  You might say "ouch".  Then you shake it off like it's no big deal.  You might even pop up off the floor, do a little dance, and calmly have a conversation with your brother immediately after like Mark Ruffalo does near the end of this movie.  He was shot in the back, but showed no signs of pain or even physical limitation during the performance he gave for his brother.  On top of that.  His brother doesn't even drive back to try to save him once he realizes the blood is real.
