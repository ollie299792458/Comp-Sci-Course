I have seen this movie numerous times, and the sound of those Merlins growling along with a stirring musical score is thrilling! The air to air shots are excellent by any standard, and the dance of the Spitfires and  Hurricanes as they rip into their Luftwaffe prey is superbly  choreographed-once again accompanied by an excellent musical score. What  the film fails to capture is the gruelling desperation with which the RAF  somehow fought off the Nazi onslaught, or the fact that many of their  native pilots were schoolboys of 19 or 20 who had joined peacetime flying  clubs, probably never expecting to die in a burning fighter plane, or how  very close the British came to losing simply out of exhaustion and horrible  attrition. I don't think Air Marshall Dowding was given the credit he  deserved by the film, although the quiet, unassuming man was richly  portrayed by Sir Laurence Olivier. Robert Shaw is excellent as a  hard-bitten, no nonsense Squadron leader, and Micheal Caine does his best  to keep a British stiff upper lip. Like all films, it is slightly flawed  but should not be missed by any history or aviation enthusiast.
