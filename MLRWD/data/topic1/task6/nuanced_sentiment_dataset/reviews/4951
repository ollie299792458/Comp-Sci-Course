Ghidorah: The Three Headed Monster is the sequel to Mothra vs. Godzilla and a significant turning point in the Godzilla franchise. This film marks the start of Godzilla's transition from villain to anti-hero to hero and introduces his greatest foe; the three headed space dragon King Ghidorah. A fairly good film that has finally be released on DVD. Like the others this DVD contains both the original unedited, undubbed Japanese version and the "Americanized" version.

Unlike Mothra vs. Godzilla, the quality of the American print is on par with the Japanese one, unfortunately it's not as good as Mothra vs. Godzilla. At times the picture quality is good but at other times the colours are faded and the print has scratches and hairs. The audio quality is fairly decent, keep in mind it's in its original mono soundtrack.

The special features are decent though slim. It has the Japanese trailer but it isn't subtitled so unless you speak/read Japanese you won't understand it. The image galleries are nice with some good background info on the monsters and the movie but personally, I miss the poster slide show they had on Mothra vs. Godzilla.

The biggest special feature is the audio commentary on the English dubbed version by David Kalat. I've seen some reviews that criticize these commentaries as "fan boys gushing about how much they love these movies" but that's not a fair description. David Kalat makes it clear how much he loves the movie, but he still shares some interesting behind the scenes tidbits on the film and the Godzilla franchise in general. If anything he's guilty of letting his inner child out, and really who can blame him for that. When you've grown up watching these films, like I have, it's hard not to see them through rose coloured glasses of nostalgia.

All in all, Ghidorah is a decent film with a decent DVD release. It could have been better but it's the best were going to get.
