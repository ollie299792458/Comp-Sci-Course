What is a widow to do when her husband dies leaving her in debt and losing everything?  This is the question at the beginning of the movie when we meet Grace, who is steadily having things reposessed from her manor house and having to lay off her workers.  She, a prize winning orchid grower, has nothing to fall back on and nowhere to turn.  
Her gardener, a nice young man in a shaky relationship, turns to her for her expertise in helping a small plant he has been trying to grow under cover behind the parish.  Grace may seem naive but she snaps immediately on the fact that this is a marijuana plant. But it is a plant and her heart goes out for it.  As she nurses it back to health in her greenhouse she begins to realize its value to her and the gardener realizes her ability with the plants and a plan is hatched. 
This is a truly funny movie with realistic seeming characters "thinking outside of the box". The whole township is endearing as they try to support Grace through her difficult times and some hilarious things ensue.
