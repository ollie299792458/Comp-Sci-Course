Political thriller that spends too much time pretending to be a psychological drama. Paper-thin stereotypes in place of characters: devious Chinese, humorless Russians, corrupt politicians, drunken army guy who redeems himself, empty-headed bimbos, and a tortured lead character who conveniently blasts himself at the end. And any number of characters who serve no real purpose like the Korean butler and the other "sleeper" soldiers. As someone else pointed out, the communists hardly needed to go to so much trouble--they could have just hired a hitman. There was nothing clever about their plot and no discernible reason for them to such lengths simply to put a shooter at a convention that didn't seem to have any security at all. One can imagine that a flimsy movie like this might have inspired Oswald to take a shot at a president. It's hard to imagine anyone else taking it seriously.

It's a "classic" because the people who remade it say it's a classic. Sans remake, this movie would have stayed where it belonged: on late, late, late night TV, watched by the half dozen people left in America who don't have cable.
