Not that bad- this is a horror film that at least tries to have a story. Only problem is that if you watch SUpernatural you know the whole plot in the first 5 minutes. Hey- the town founders were mass murderers and thieves and their victims want revenge. How to stop a curse? Give the ghosts what they want or get out of the way!

Highlights? Tom Welling as a hot fishing charter captain involved with 2 women in the film- his girlfriend Ann who went off to New York 6 months ago, and his current affair Stevie ( played by perpetual romantic second banana Selma Blair) who is a single mom and runs the local island radio station. '

As for the Tom Welling factor- we see him shirtless 3 times- once changing from his work clothes into a thick ribbed turtleneck sweater, another time in a shower sex scene- funny thing is that the girl's body is hardly shown at all but we get a good view of Tom's chest, finally we see him shirtless in bed with the girlfriend when she wakes up from a nightmare. You can watch this film in about 30 minutes if you fast forward through boring stuff with the other townspeople.

In the end Ann ends up joining her ghostly predecessors- somehow she is one of the victims reincarnated so for once Selma Blair gets the guy!

Not anything great but ok. Would work better as a 48 minute tv episode editing out most of the long scenes trying to figure out what is happening.
