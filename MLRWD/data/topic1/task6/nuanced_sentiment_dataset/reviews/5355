The MIB concept of an official group dealing with extraterrestrials living secretly on earth is great.  I own MIB and MIB 2.

This movie concentrated on a single given "alien". And that "alien" looked essentially human.
Both K and J act like super-heroes, not normal people, in that they crawl over structures like Spiderman.

And time travel was the major thing in the movie. Not single time travel, but multiple time travels occurring simultaneously. Cornier than corny.

Aliens, the very few that are shown, are only secondary to time travel.

There was sooo much original background material available to work with to generate great new original stories. But no, they had one clich&eacute; bad guy and spent the movie hunting him down. All clich&eacute;. All done many times before in many other movies.

They could have had more emersion of the MIB group dealing with multiple aliens; e.g., something like Avatar and MIB-1 did: emersion in an alternate reality. But no. Just standard invincible super hero stuff like Thor and Batman.

Also there were no jokes to overcome the lack of a story. I never laughed once. What happened to the joke writers?
What a waste.

Josh Brolin, playing the young agent K, is super super great. You would never know that he was not Tommy Lee Jones. He is the one bright spot in the movie.
