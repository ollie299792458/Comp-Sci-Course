My husband & I rented this movie, and since it's rated PG-13 we thought we should watch it before the kids got ahold of it, and I'm sure glad we did.  We laughed a lot, thought it was cute, and we both really like Ben Stiller, but pretty much from the beginning we decided we weren't letting our 13 & 11 yr olds watch it.  Personally, we wouldn't let anyone under 15 watch it.  There's far too much sexual innuendo, crude humor, foul language.  My husband & I are definitely not prudes, but we certainly don't want our kids exposed to stuff like when the Average Joe's team is forced to wear S&M costumes, when Ben Stiller's character gets turned on & starts, ummm..., "massaging" himself with a slice of pizza, or the scene at the end with the girl-girl kissing!  Just not stuff we think young kids should see.

If you're an adult and enjoy some great slap-stik (and can handle your own flashbacks to the pain of dodgeball on the playground), and plain old sillyness, then this would be a great weekend rental.  But, I would recommend watching it when the kids have gone to bed or are out to a sleepover!
