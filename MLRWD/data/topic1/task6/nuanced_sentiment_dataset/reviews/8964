What would happen if all the things we've done to our environment came back to haunt us? This is the scenario in "The Day After Tomorrow," when the earth finally gives up on human civilization with the melting of the polar ice caps, a result of years of global warming. The lack of saltwater, after the melting, causes a chain of catastrophic weather events including tornadoes in Los Angeles, flooding in New York and an aproaching Ice Age for the entire northern hemisphere.

Who can save the day? Dennis Quaid plays Professor Hill, a climatologist employed by the U.S. government. He has been predicting such chaos for a while now, to the doubts of the President and his cabinet. He must now convince the U.S. government to evacuate every citizen in the southern United States to safe Mexico. Unfortunately, those in the northern United States cannot be saved, as the paralyzing cold creeps quickly in their direction.

Also, Professor Hill's son is trapped in New York and will die a freezing death in a short matter of time if he is not saved. Can Professor Hill convince the President to save as many Americans as possible by evacuating? Can he reach his son in time? Can human life survive another Ice Age - one that they created? Watch "The Day After Tomorrow," with its amazing special effects and scary, "this could really happen" feeling to see if we still have a chance.

The Day After Tomorrow is a good special effect movie but its plot far away excelent. Still it is worth of watching.
