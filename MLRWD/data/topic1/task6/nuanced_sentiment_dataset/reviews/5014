All right, I've read some great reviews for this movie, (granted it was very well directed) but 1.5 dreary hours of this guy looking for his bike is not my idea of entertainment.  They didn't give us anything.  They could  have at least had the boy triumphantly say, "Oh poppa, look... I finda  the bell!"  And oh how joyous their night without sheets would have  been!  Every now and again they would give you a glimmer of hope (hope that  the movie was going somewhere) when Rici finds a lead, but it always ends  up being a dead end.  I thought the point of movies was to entertain, not  to remind you that life can suck.  I think most people out there believe  that life sucks without the help of brooding Italian film makers.  The  movie should have ended after about 40 minutes on the one minor high note  it had: It was in the restaurant when Rici realized that life can suck when  you're poor but 'what can ya do?'  So he splurged on a nice meal and some  wine to get himself and his prepubescent son drunk! (The movie barely gets  one star for the excellent directing)
