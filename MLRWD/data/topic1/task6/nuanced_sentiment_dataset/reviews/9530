Yes, I am one of those irritating people who have never read the comic (sorry, but I am simply not a comic reader--more so because I never had the opportunity to become addicted) and had barely heard of Iron Man until I saw the trailor for this very movie back in the day.

So... my review will be based simply on my impressions of the movie with no reference to Marvel or comic anything else.  Because I don't know any of that.

To begin, this is a fantastic movie.  I don't know enough about movie making to disect the details, but I like to think I can avoid the truly terrible and I do know what I like.  So in my humble opinion this is a truly wonderful movie, having everything I think a truly wonderful movie needs:  good plot, decent effects, great acting, and lots of heart.  Yes, I was honestly touched by this movie.

And that is because what truly got me was the theme.  I'm not a fan of war (I don't think anyone truly is) and there was something about the whole fight-for-peace thing that got to me--and this is doubled by the change of heart for lead character Tony Stark.  Sue me, I'm a sucker for that sort of thing.

So this theme leads into a delightfully action-y storyline that is simple enough to carry itself through without being brain-killing.  The cast is SUPERB. I can't think of anyone else I could get to play a part in this assortment of characters.  And these characters?  A great blend of humanity mixed with a definite "fun" feel.  Wonderful combination.

And I can't get over how the screen sizzles when Downey and Paltrow have a scene together. And they never even kiss. That is a testament against all those that think rampant sex is the only way to show passion on the silver screen.

Apparently this movie was enough to please someone who does not read comics.  It has the action, romance, and heart to make a quality movie.
