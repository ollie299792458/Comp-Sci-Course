Okay. I'll admit it. I am really sick of vampires, unless they are being used as bullet fodder. Until the trendy Twilight craze finally dies down, I will usually avoid vampire books/films/TV shows, etc. like the plague.

This film was completely different, and utterly refreshing. Dark and pensive, and beautiful in a bleak Scandinavian manner, Let The Right One In completely hooked me and became one of my favorite films from the first time I watched it. No sparkly vegetarian vamps here (thank God!!!). Only two lonely and strange youngsters who find comfort and protection in each other's company. While there seems to be an element of romance, it is not a "romance" in the traditional cheeseball sense.

I don't want to give a lot away...this is simply a film that you must watch to understand and appreciate. If you are looking for another Twilight-esque vampire film, look elsewhere...for the rest of us, this film is a true gem.

*A note on subtitles: I am not rating this film according to the subtitle quality on the DVD--I am rating the film on its theatrical and artistic merits as it would have been seen in the theater.*
