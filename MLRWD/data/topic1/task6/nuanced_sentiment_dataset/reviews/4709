If you want a primer on how not to make a 'Body Snatchers' movie, go and rent 'The Invasion'  right now. Knowing something of the film's troubled production - the original cut delivered to the studio by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009RCPUC">Downfall</a> alumnus Oliver Hirschbiegel was considered to be 'too arthouse' by producer Joel Silver and consequently two thirds of the film was reshot by those purveyors of crimes against cinema, the Wachowski Brothers - left me wanting to see Hirschbiegel's original cut in order to see what was considered so cinematically reprehensible that it had to be reconfigured into a load of sub-action toss by two siblings, who, if there were any justice in the universe, would never be let near a film camera again. Frustratingly, it did have some intriguing ideas in it. The news reports showing vistas of the world succumbing to the REM pods - Chavez and Bush signing a peace accord, US troops pulling out of Iraq and handing over control to Moqtadr Al Sadr - showed the tantalising promise of a much more interesting exploration of the concept of a post-pod planet.  For the most part though, and as I observed to the other half while watching it, "this is everything that's wrong with modern American cinema", which is a pity because its in complete contrast to Philip Kaufman's definitive 1978 version of the tale, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QQJ3Q0">Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Collector's Edition)</a>, which is everything that's right about modern American cinema and still one of the most chilling films that I've ever seen.
