Without a doubt, this was the worst film I've ever seen.  After watching this film, you will honestly wonder, "What were their agents thinking about?"  Having seen this movie late at night, I first thought it was a bad skit, or was waiting for some sign that the entire production cast involved didn't really make this film.  Not even bad good enough to be a good "bad" film, the story of a three-armed comic and the manipulative agent that runs his career left me 100 minutes later asking, "What were they thinking?"  Not camp, but some bizarre freakshow of a film without a redeeming quality.  Judd Nelson need not look farther than this project why his career peaked with "The Breakfast Club."  Bill Paxton and Lara Flynn-Boyle somehow survived this to go on to better opportunities (how could there be a worse one?)  Rob Lowe wisely disguised himself for a brief cameo.  With every real star that appeared in this movie, it made me think that they really need to start reading these scripts before they agree to them.  At least, I pray they didn't read it beforehand!
