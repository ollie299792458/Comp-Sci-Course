If you can suspend your disbelief and cynicism for an hour or two..., then you may leave this movie feeling that despite all of our flaws that there is something good, true and dare I say it noble in all of us.

You can read the other review for a synopsis of the film, but for me two scenes come to mind that reveal the true magic of this wonderful film

When James Cromwell as Farmer Hoggett sings and dances for the sick little pig, a truly human and tender gesture of affection for Babe, I find myself choking up with emotion (that's not a tear, that's a speck of dust in my eye).

Similarly when the Farmer Hoggett places his faith and trust in Babe to be able to perform in the sheep trial, when despite all the laughter and ridicule he stands firm, until the trial is over and the gate is closed, that moment my friends is pure bliss and transcendence.

Perhaps it is become there are few characters as masculine or manly as an Australian farmer, but beneath his gruff exterior there lies a human being, and this film shows that sometimes despite what the world tells us, our humanity can only be found in our most human of moments.

Cheers!
