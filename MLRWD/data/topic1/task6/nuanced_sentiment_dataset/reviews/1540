This film is not for some people. There are plenty of reviews here from "plain old regular folk" who are perfectly willing to "tell it like it is," about how this movie is, "just a bunch of artsy fartsy people talkin' French." According to these "reviewers" folksy mentalities, anything that they don't understand must be bad. No effort is really spent trying to understand it (after all, why should they try to use their brains, right?)- and in the case of this film, that effort would have earned dividends.

This is a fantastic movie, a cornucopia of film techniques all jammed into one perfect film. I'm a film student at NYU, and a huge fan of classic films. This doesn't really qualify me for anything other than to say that I do spend time thinking about film, and this film in particular. I don't think that everyone will like this film- or that everyone SHOULD like this film. However, if you dislike the film, at least be sure you understand it before you go around trashing it. Otherwise you're really only discrediting yourself, and possibly scaring people away from a movie that they very well may enjoy.
