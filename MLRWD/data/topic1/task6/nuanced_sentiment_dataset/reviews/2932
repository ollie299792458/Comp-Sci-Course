First and foremost, this is a work of fiction.  It is a presented AS a documentary, much the same way Orsen Well's production of War of the Worlds was presented.  However, there is no actual evidence present, only elaborate conjecture built on speculation and clear misinterpretation of real historical work.

That said, this is a very well produced series.  The production values are wonderful, the 'experts' are well spoken (and with a wonderful touch many have crazy hair - ala mad scientists on the fringe), the on-site videos are very well done and in many cases beautiful.  The announcer sounds like, and could very well be, the same person from many other serious documentaries.

The only downside is the constant jumping from one subject, or ancient culture, to another.  While that creates a dynamic visual montage, it becomes distracting.

I would recommend this for Halloween parties or the like, and if you just want to decompress after a long day.  But please be aware that many of the artifacts they attribute to aliens have well documented and understood non-alien meanings.
