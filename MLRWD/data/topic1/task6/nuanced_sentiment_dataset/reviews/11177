I think this season is the epitome of hit-or-miss. It seemed like every other episode was either filler or just poorly written. Also, I frequently felt the deleted scenes should've stayed in instead of much of the kept scenes. While this show doesn't have much consistancy in general this season is particularly bad in this area where it seemed almost nothing had any effect in later eps. Don't get me wrong, this season definitely had its moments, but they were few and far between. Many of the jokes were more for shock-value instead of actual humor and Jim & Pam are just plain boring now. The show is still great, but with only about 50% of the eps being good this season (at best) it is clear the show is losing some steam, which is a turning point few shows fully recover from. If you're a big-time fan of the show then I would of course recommend getting this season, but if you're only interested in Jim & Pam's wedding, or some other event that takes place in an ep or two, then just download it/them.
