I can't honestly give this three stars.  Although the realism immersion into the environment and that these monsters exist is nicely done, the movie is simply about a man and woman's journey through the infected monster zone, and the monsters are more of a backdrop.  I was hoping for a bit more action, and creature involvement, but the only time you really see a couple of the monsters a bit closer is near the end where two of them seem to be somewhat making out with their tentacles, but then quietly depart, but even then, it's all in the dark, hard to make out.  I guess a moment where you're supposed to feel some empathy towards the creatures or something.  Let's see, they destroy everything, millions of people displaced, or killed... ya, sorry, no sympathy whatsoever.  The ending was abrupt, and left things kinda hanging between the guy and the girl, queue your brain to insert your own hopeful ending here I guess.  Don't get me wrong, not a bad movie, decent effects, and cinematography, good realism, ok for a one time viewing, just a bit lacking for my taste.
