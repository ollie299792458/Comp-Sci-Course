really sad it was released at the same time as "sixt sense. kevin bacon does his best performance ever,as a man furfilling his task.to tell more about his task ,is revealing to much of the plot in advance.a great film focusing on the topic through the whole film.the director has suceeded to not bringing in to many out siders to the plot.in it self the plot is not the biggest master piece.but it is the creaping feeling through out the film. and the best ,the director has not stuffed in tons gore as directors usually do .this movie could all most have been given the rating pg-13 ,beacause this is a film with real style and genious acting .and erbe is also great as the wife,and the little son in the house has a small but very important role as a...,well see your self ! and most important the film has not been spoiled with tons of extra special effects .this film is based up on great acting and a creepy feeling through out the film.beside that the dvd has quite good extras,just the perfect amount,not too much . even here quality rules .and the menu is not bad,with enigmatic background and great ambient music .this is simply one of the best haunting movie in ages .sorry "sixt sense" you just fell to number 2!you like suspense or hauting tales (with style) ? do not miss this master piece !
