This movie is the sickest piece of garbage I have ever seen.  People on here say that "we should see what child abuse is like to understand it."  No, you don't.  You don't need to see simulated video of Holocaust victims being thrown into ovens to know that the Holocaust was bad.  You don't need to see a woman being raped to know it's bad.  It's common sense that this is bad.  If you don't know that child abuse is bad and you need to see video confirming it's bad, then you have no business being in any society in general.

This is a piece of smut, no more.  It has no redeeming qualities.  To sum it up in a few words, it is a horrible montage of torture, rape, and mutilation.  I think watching Faces of Death has more redeeming value and is easier to watch than this.  It doesn't even have a good ending, which makes it even worse.

Avoid at all costs unless you enjoy seeing filth like this.  Maybe this would be enjoyable for pedophiles and sadists, but not for normal people.
