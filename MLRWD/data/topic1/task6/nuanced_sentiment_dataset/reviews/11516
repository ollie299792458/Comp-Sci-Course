They sure changed the flavor of the book that I read! Instead of making the book into a movie .. they made a movie from some highschool girls book report about the book. Being in high school she either .. A) didn't really read the book and only wrote her report about a few chapters or portions of chapters  B) had to leave out the sexy, gruesome stuff or parents and teachers would get upset  OR  C)  Didn't understand any of it so she wrote her book report about only the simplest parts that she did understand. This is what happens when a story that couldn't and probably shouldn't have been made into a movie - gets turned over to a production company that only wants to use the notoriety of the title to sell tickets. Once you are in the theater they can show you any story as long as the names of the characters are unchanged from the book, the locale and key catch lines and phrases remain. Although the acting performances were excellent when judged on their own merit .. American Psycho was so totally sanitized that it came out looking like "The Shining Does Wall Street" with an ending plucked straight out of the "Dallas" TV night time soap!  Patrick Bateman/Bobby Ewing really didn't do any of those things .. only in his mind/dream. The NOVEL left you UNDECIDED as to the reality of the deeds .. this MOVIE softens the whole thing and all but superimpose an "IMAGINARY KILLER" caption over Bateman's headshot at the end. This film should have been called "AMERICAN PSYCHO LITE". I realize how distateful the book was but why turn it into a Saturday matinee? I'd much rather they had not made the movie at all than to have to soak it in so much estrogen that it was drained of all its energy. Director Harron should find some windows to wash or cookies to bake ... where are Wes Craven and David Cronenberg when you really need them? If you have not read the book, watch the movie. If you have read the book ... flee .. and keep your mental images intact!
