The cover is misleading; this is not your classic vampire movie - doesn't really deal with vampires, other than a few allusions and references. The plot centers around the life & exploits of Vlad Tepes (the Impaler). Though it did not have the prerequisite vampires running around, I REALLY dug this movie. Maybe it was because I was impressed that a made for TV movie was so well researched and directed. Maybe it was because I am a romantic kind of girl & liked the romance, as well as the eye candy (Rudolph Martin, Michael Sutton, etc) that the lead actors provided (for any fan of long-haired men, this movie is a must see!).
The story was actually fairly well written and more or less historically accurate. The costumes were great & the battle scenes well created. As to Vlad's true character, some is left to the viewer's imagination, but that is to be expected when dealing with a man who has amassed such a mythos in popular culture. I would say that this is a movie for any fan of the vamp genre, more entertaining for a fan of history and the vampire subculture in general...not a typical "vampire" movie, just a bio, but it remains one of the best portrayals of "Vlad Tepes".
