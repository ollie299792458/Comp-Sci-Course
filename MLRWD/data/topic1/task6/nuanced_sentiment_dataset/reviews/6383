Reviews Of Unusual Size!

Re: Seven tormented friends stumble across a much deeper problem than bullies - a dark evil living beneath the town of Derry, ME that has been killing men and children for centuries.

Outstanding: Considering the fact that this is a TV movie from 1990, the scares and effects in it are quite effective. The cast, especially the kids are great. It's fun to see where the kids are now. Though I didn't picture Pennywise looking quite like he does, Tim Curry is spectacular as the evil clown.

Unacceptable: Despite their best efforts, the effects show their age, especially the big climax, which deviates from the story quite a bit. The movie loses a lot of the elaborate stories and creatures from the novel.

Summary: Long, creepily effective TV movie with some good performances. I wished they'd kept the more traditional clown outfit from the story, and the adaptation took some unusual turns. My wife and I thought we'd like it a lot less than we did, but we found ourselves quite enjoying the 3 hour film.

3/5

Notes: There have been rumors about a new, major motion picture swirling around. I have a really hard time seeing how they could condense this into a theatrical release, but it'd be fun to see some better beasties.
