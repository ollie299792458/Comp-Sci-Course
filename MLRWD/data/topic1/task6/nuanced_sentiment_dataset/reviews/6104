Let's hope Ms. Imbruglia was well paid for suffering the indignity of playing Agent 99  to Atkinson's Maxwell Smart in this literal cesspool of a movie. Wasting a starlet this photogenic on a prepubescent knockoff of Austin Powers should be considered a snickering form of inverse sexual harassment. In fact, I have to wonder whether it wasn't this stinker that set off the listless downward spiral of her once-promising career.

After the spectacular breakout of Imbruglia's "Torn" music video in 1997, her follow-up releases failed to measure up to her initial success. And as her big-screen debut in Johnny English inspired little more than catcalls from movie critics, Imbruglia took refuge in a five-year spokesmodel contract with L'Oreal. After a long absence from music, her 2009 come-back album subsequently vanished without comment. Currently, Imbruglia has found a comfortable gig in the Paula Abdul role in Australia's "The X Factor" knockoff of American Idol.

Perhaps the most humiliating turn of events, however, has been the fate of Imbruglia's "Torn" video on YouTube. While the original version has garnered over 2.2 million views, it was recently edged out in popularity by the bedroom karaoke performance of fresh-faced amateur vocalist, Marie Digby. Pity poor Ms. Imbruglia, a has-been at the awkward age of 35.
