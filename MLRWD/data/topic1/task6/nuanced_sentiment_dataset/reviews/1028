I am a HUGE fan of the first "CUBE."  I have seen CUBE many of times and each time it gets me.  Its intense and I care about all of the characters.  Now with "Cube 2: Hypercube: I didn't feel anything for the characters.  Classified as Horror/Scifi I tend to think of CUBE as a psychological thriller.  After awhile its the characters you are interested in and not the dang CUBE they are in.  
CUBE 2 I just didn't have that connections.  Gerant Wyn Davies from early 90's good vampire (pre Angel) TV show Forever Night I liked cause he was familiar face, but in reality he became the same character as Quentin was in the first movie.  Actually many of the characters pretty much are just the same in away as the characters in the first one.  Here they added a few more, but overall nothing new.  That bothered me.  CUBE 1 had great feel with the colors of the different rooms.  Cube 2 everything is white and nothing seems dangerous.  The colors added to the intensity, Cube 2 the white didn't do anything for the intensity of the film.
If you loved the first Cube I say watch this one.  You actually appreciate the first CUBE a lot better.  Cube 2 wasn't a bad flick at all, its just a part 2 wasn't needed.  Ending of part 1 had my thinking all night, and the ending for part 2 I was already done thinking about it when the credit's rolled.
