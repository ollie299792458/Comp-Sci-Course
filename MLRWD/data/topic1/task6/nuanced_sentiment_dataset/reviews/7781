It makes me laugh when i read all the reviews about how people were disappointed were by the lack of "shock" this movie provided.  Honestly, if Kubrick had decided to engage us in a sexually shocking film,  why would he have chosen a book entitled "Dream Story?"  Or  titled the movie "Eyes Wide Shut?"  Kubrick has always titled his  movies very deliberately, and he didn't just slip up here.  Kubrick seeks  to examine the realms of dream and reality, especially in those times where  the line between them becomes blurry.  This is the artistic content Kubrick  sought to explore, and he did that just fine.  What better way to question  reality then letting a man (Cruise) wander through every man's greatest  fantasy?  Those who were disappointed by this film should go rent a  Penthouse flick, because they're clearly interested only in having their  libido satisfied.  This is a movie that uses sex as a tool for greater  ideas, and in that respect, Eyes Wide Shut uses it expertly.
