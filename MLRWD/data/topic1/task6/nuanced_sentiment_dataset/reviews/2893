Well, we knew the story and how it ended before we hit "play" on the DVD. In my mind I was hoping to gain a better understanding of why he was taken and what was done to find him. This story offers neither. Quite simply its a mess beginning to end. Cconfusing in that you can't understand half of what's said by the Pakistani characters, either because of the their strong accent, or the fact that many of the investigation scenes are non-english with no sub-titles. As another reviewer noted, many scenes do nothing to enhance the story or your understanding of it. Case in point, just after his abduction, the house was full of Pakistanis. An female brusier of an FBI agent comes in and orders everyone out of the house. We're to assume, (I guess) that the calvary has arrived and now we're going to find Mr. Pearle. Well - that was the last we saw of the FBI, and their agent - I still don't know why the scene was included in the movie.

Add to that the complicated names and relationships they draw out on their white board with arrows going everywhere and never any attempt to explain it to us - well, the movie just wears you down.

At the end, they did a epilogue of sorts, explaining what happened to the individuals in the story. Honestly, many of the people they discussed had such little exposure, and you really weren't sure what their involvement was in the case, that you really didn't care. I found it interesting that one person whas sentenced to life for being the actual murderer but I can't say I saw him in during the movie.

Other than this being a vehicle for Jolie to show case her amazing beauty, it was a complete mess as far as I am concerned.
