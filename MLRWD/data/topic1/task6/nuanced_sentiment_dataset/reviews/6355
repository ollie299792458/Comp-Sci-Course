First, I am not qualified to evaluate how realistic this scenario was at the time this film was made.  I do not have the necessary political and military background.

Overall, the film is very grim (as it should be).  The scenario is that a limited nuclear exchange takes place very early on in the film due to a series of mistakes/miscommunications/misperceptions on both sides.  Most of the film is centered around avoiding a full nuclear exchange.  Even if successful, the damage and death toll is still tremendous.

Some other reviewers have criticized the dialogue and that gets to the point of this review.  So far over 60 people have reviewed this film but nobody has mentioned the most memorable line in the film:

"Cut the head off of the Communist Chicken!"

This is perhaps the most hilarious line I have ever heard in a movie!  The context of this line is that it summarizes/concludes a colonel's plan to kill the soviet leadership with a nuclear warhead.  The line is delivered in a firm and serious manner which makes it even funnier.  I have to conclude that the film director inserted this line into the dialogue as a form of black humor.

The rest of this film is 100% serious.

Overall I enjoyed the film, I thought it was decent.  Perhaps the film is not realistic - I will leave that for those with a military background to evaluate.  However, for the typical person on the street's perspective, the film is believable.
