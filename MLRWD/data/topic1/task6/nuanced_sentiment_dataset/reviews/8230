Sienna Miller as Edie Sedgwick is a good start for anyone unfamiliar with Edie's life and history, but it really doesn't even scratch the surface of Edie the rocker, the masochist, or the life artist.  Her days at The Factory and with Warhol were so short compared to the rest of her life, that the film leads one to believe The Factory was all that it was.  Where is Edie's disturbing childhood?  Her days with Bartle Bull or at Cambridge?  Where is there any mention of Alan Ginsberg, Nico, Jim Morrison - or even filming Ciao Manhattan?  Not even a whisper of her last years in California and her eventual downfall? Why can't the audience get a truly realistic insight into Edie's drug addiction and descent other than the standardizied version shown in the film?  Unfortunately, this bio-pic lacks a lot of important details that could help iillustrate why Edie is still such an icon even 36 years after her death, and although Sienna looks the part, she fails to truly go severly deep into the disturbingly dark, reckless, yet playful Edie that we see in film clips and photo stills. A true Edie fan will miss the epic details and lovable eccentricities and vulnerabilities that Jean Stein's book gives so much more insight to.
