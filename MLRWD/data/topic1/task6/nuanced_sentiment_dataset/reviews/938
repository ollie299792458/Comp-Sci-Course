It's been a while since I've seen Robocop, so I picked up this DVD set.
Robocop 1 is such a great movie! Watching it now is a lot better than it was when I watched it as a teenager. It was great back then, but there was so much that I didn't pick up. Watching it now from a man's prospective is a totally different experience. 
The version of Robocop 1 in this set is the "un-rated" version. I would definitely keep it away from children. Some of the scenes are a lot more gory and grusome than they were in the "R" rated version (A LOT MORE!) and on it's own, this version is hard to find.  Robocop 3, on the other hand, is more family oriented and only rated PG-13. The violence from the previous movies has been toned down quite a bit and there is no use of the "F" bomb. It's a nice movie, but it does not have the same feel of the other two(or actor. Peter Weller chose not to return.)
These movies have aged well because they were ahead of there time when they came out. A great DVD set and a purchase that I don't regret!
