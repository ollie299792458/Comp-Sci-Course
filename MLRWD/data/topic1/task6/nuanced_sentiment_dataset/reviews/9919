If you are a fan of silent films (like I am) or have a love for film history (like I do) then this set is a "must have".  I have seen all of Chaplin's feature length silent films and many of his shorts.  I had seen a handful of Keaton's films (both shorts and features).  This 3-disc set only has shorts, and they are wonderful.  The restoration quality varies from film-to-film.  The music is well done and fitting for the style of each film.  A booklet comes with the discs that provides a short paragraph of history/insight into each film.  I wish there was a more fully developed write-up for each film, but the short paragraphs are nice to provide context for each films.  The films themselves are fantastic.  My kids have wandered in the room when I have been watching them and say "are you watching another silent film?"  But then they stop, watch a little bit, and next thing you know the short 20-minute film is over and they say "that was pretty good".  This is a great collection that serves as a wonderful example of why Keaton is considered a master of the silent film era.
