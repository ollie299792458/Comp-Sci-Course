I am a huge fan of The Omen series and I love everyone of them, I have a review of each below-

The Omen- A truely great movie. In this movie Mrs. Kathy Thorn gives birth to a stillborn child, to sheild her from the truth her Husband Ambassador Robert Thorn adopts a orphan boy, knowing nothing of the boys hellish origins. This legacy of terror begins at little Damien Thorn's 5th birthday, when his nanny hangs her self from the top of the Thorn Mansion. Pretty soon many horrible 'accidents' start to happen and little by little Robert realises his son is the Anti-Christ and must try to stop him...I would give this movie six out of five stars if possible but Ill settle and give it 5 out of 5.

Damien: The Omen II- Damien is now a young man of 13, and has gone to live with his aunt and uncle, he now realizes the great power he has and that he is the Anti-Christ himself. Several gruesome deaths occur to any who oppose him and Uncle Thorn must try to end what his brother started. 5 out of 5 stars

The Final Conflict- In this movie Damien is now a very rich and powerful man of 23. He becomes ambassador following in his adopted fathers footsteps all while continuing to follow in his true fathers footsteps. This movie lacks a factor of the previous two, the fact that it is a child causing all the deaths and chaos, though it is still a great movie. 4 out of 5 stars

The Omen IV: The Awakening- This movie is EXTREAMLY under-rated, it brings the series back to its origins. Little Delia is an adopted child who has trouble making friends in school, but after a few 'accidents' eeriely similar to those in the case of one Damien Thorn, Delia and her adopted mother realize what she really is, the heir of the Anti-Christ. I think this movie is great dispite what anyone else thinks about it I give it a 5 out of 5.

I HIGHLY recomend you buy this set, you won't regret it.
