I went in saw this movie the night it come out largely because i was bored, it looked interesting and there was nothing better out. It had its cheesy moments, its unintentional funny moments but it also had some good points. This movie got alot of flack from everyone but you have to accept it for what it is and i have definety seen MUCH worse from Hollywood. I liked it particulary because it was different. It based its self around the wierd topic of twin stigmata...So i was game for something other than run of the mill.

Also if you're sort of like me, a Lindsey Lohan closet fan, you'll probably enjoy her performance in this movie. It was nice to see her branch out and do something other than a disney remake or a chick flick (even though those were good)

I gave it 3 stars because it was no way the best movie id ever seen but it definetly by far wasnt the worst movie i've ever seen. If you're pretty open minded and are hungry for something different to watch, give this movie a try.
