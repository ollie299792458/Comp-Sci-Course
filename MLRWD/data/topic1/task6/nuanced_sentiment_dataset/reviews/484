This is not an evening's fun entertainment.  This is not light and fluffy. This is a film that will really upset some people and will cause people to get into heavy discussions.  The story, based on an excellent novel by PD James (not her usual English murder mystery stuff), takes place in a future when the population is in danger of dying out because there have been no babies born for about 20 years. The situaion is very bleak and anarchy is reigning supreme.  The discovery of a young pregnant woman leads a small group to attempt getting out of the country and out of harm's way.  Having been labelled "terrorists" by the authorities, the group are being dogged by everyone and in grave danger of being caught. Their journey is heart wrenching and frenetic and full of action. I cannot begin to tell about everything that happens because this film needs to be seen by EVERYBODY.  The cast is excellent-Clive Owen, Jullianne Moore, Michael Caine.  The cinematography is fabulous, much deserving of its Oscar.  You MUST see this film.  It will put something on your mind...and not let go.
