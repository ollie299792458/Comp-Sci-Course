We enjoyed this fantasy- adventure, but you must quickly park your reason and commonsense at the dock right away, or it'll drive you crazy, e.g., what loving father would leave his young daughter alone for two days, even, or especially, on a beautiful, deserted island?  And how could they live there without other kids or family for her to play with?  Wow, that parenting mind never shuts off.

The actual island where Nim and father live and work alone is a place where every kid and kid wanna-be should vacation, and the tale reminds me of "Joe and the Volcano", kids' style, or "Swiss Family Robinson", a fun fable with likeable people, exotic locations, adventure, cute animals and a message: "You can do it!"

Abigail Breslin(Nim) is a talented, young actress; we always love Gerard Butler(Daddy/Jack, Alex' alter ego), but Jodie Foster(Alexandra) was a hoot(I had reservations beforehand) as the agoraphobic, constantly talking to herself, writer who's forced to become, more or less, her 'Indiana Jones' creation, Alex Rover.  For Foster, it's definitely a refreshing change from her slew of thrillers.

There's essentially three stories going on: 1. Nim's longing for her lost-at-sea father while 'defending' their island with the help of scene stealing animals; 2. Father's fight to get home; 3. Alexandra's struggle with self-imposed fears to help Nim.

It's appropriate for school age kids, but being left alone and the fear of losing one's father is too stressful for little ones; however, they could easily watch and enjoy the animals, the gags and the tree house.  The negatives: it's far-fetched, vascillates between serious and silly, but over all, it's a satisfying trip and with beautiful scenery- just leave your brain at home.
