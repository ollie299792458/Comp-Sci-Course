How anyone could even mention Romero and Feeding the Masses in the same sentence is beyond me.This movie is in the top 5 worst movies I've ever seen.

Seriously. As a zombie movie fan, I have to say that this doesn't even register

on my scale. It's that bad. I turned it off after the first hour, so unless

it makes a 180 and miraculously turns into a masterpiece after that point,

I feel safe to say this movie sucks beyond all you can imagine.

The acting is not even B-Movie. It's C-movie. Bad, bad overacting from every character.

The FX look like a college kid with a cracked copy of After Effects 4.5 used some filters (the "explosions") and called it a day.

The story is stupid. The characters are boring, or annoying, or both, and the acting is horrible. As a video post production animator, I can tell you that the budget for this was LOW. Looks like a few buddies got together one weekend and churned this crap out.

The production is poor. Looks like digital video, not film.

Anyway, I'm sick of wasting any more time with this. As far as the zombie genre,

like I said, this one shouldn't even register. I mean it's just a sorry movie, regardless.

If you want to see a good zombie movie, watch Day of the Dead or the new Dawn of the Dead (2004). Although VERY dated, the original "Dawn" is also very entertaining.

This movie is laughable. And not in a good way.
