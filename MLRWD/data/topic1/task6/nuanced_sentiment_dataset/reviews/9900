I ordered the movie from Netflix because the description sounded intriguing.  Unfortunately, written descriptions can be deceiving.  As the movie began I thought oh, well, it's so slow because they're setting the scene for what is about to happen.  But that doesn't really make up for the fact that the first half hour, at least, moves like molasses.  Then I began to realize that some really stupid things were happening and started to wonder if this film was meant to be taken seriously.  Or was it a complete spoof?  I'm still not sure.  The entire tone of the movie was almost satirical and then came the ending, which I won't reveal.  The ending was deadly serious.  It just didn't fit with the first 86 minutes.
I was actually embarrassed for Anthony Edwards and Mare Winningham.  They are both talented actors and why they agreed to star in this turkey is a mystery to me.  They did the best they could with the terrible script they were given, but God help us, Steve De Jarnatt is certainly no writer.  The dialog was stilted, unnatural, and most of the characters sounded as if they were reading it straight from the page.
Hours later I am still kicking myself for watching the whole thing, but I could not believe any movie with stars such as Edwards and Winningham could be so idiotic.  It truly was.
