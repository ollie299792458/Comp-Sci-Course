The film is nothing but an enumeration of facts and  figures.  There is no heart to this movie, I wonder if it should be called a movie, or just a long line of chronologically arranged news.  I guess one should not be surprised, the filmmaker is a software engineer.  Lots of numbers and dates...
I felt like I was doing time soon after the setup. About 70 percent of the stuff was common knowledge that anyone that watched the news knew about.  The rest was a bit deeper than the news, but very undeveloped. The filmmaker pointed out the strategic mistakes Bush made in Iraq, but little was done to explain what should have been done.
The most disappointing part is that the movie is pessimistic, but the premise is not developed.  "No end in Sight" equals, it is impossible to win this country. Fine, I would buy that if the film would explore different options, and have some smart PHDs and Generals explain why it would not work.
Instead the film is all about the past, while the title lures you to believe that it has a futuristic outlook "In Sight..." The end is terrible. Conclusion: Bush and Co. messed up in Iraq. In case you did not know...  we will sit you down for 2 hrs and tell you again.
I think good film making is done when a new facts or a new point of view is shown to the audience. The film does neither.
Also, there is no opposition in the film. "The US didn't defend the Baghdad Museum"  Great, but the museum was on a 16 acres and from what I read it was next to impossible at the time to secure such a large area. I wish I saw some opposing views.
The visuals were terrible. For two hours you will see talking heads and general shots of US soldiers in Baghdad. Over and over. There is also one colored map.
Conclusion: Bush messed up in Iraq. Hey, Magnolia Pictures thought it was great...Go figure...
