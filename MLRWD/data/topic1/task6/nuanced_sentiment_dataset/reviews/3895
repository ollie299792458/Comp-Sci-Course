This is a film that documents Jeff Tweedy and his band Wilco making the album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot as well as the struggles between bandmates and their record label.I had read about how they had a difficult time getting the album released because the label thought it not profitable enough.Has it always been this bad? Fionna Apple and Juliana Hatfield are still struggling with this problem.I had gotten the album from the public library of all places and thought that who ever made the decision to not release this didn't know the first thing about music as it is a great album.

But you don't need to be a Wilco fan nor a fan of the album per say.If you're a fan of MUSIC and want to see what goes into making an album and the crap that can occur than i suggest that you see this.If you are a fan of Wilco than what have you been waiting for? There's alot of Tweedy here,including live solo acoustic,live with Wilco,and Tweedy the family man.I mention his name often because I think that he is one of the only of a handful of TRUE artists out there.He won't compromise his soul and heart,all of which makes a TRUE artist.
