Nice to look at historical biopic but nothing like the reality.  The story is so confused and inaccurate you start to wonder if it was some other Cromwell they are talking about.  Cromwell is too important before the 1st Civil War, the 2nd Civil War, the Invasion of Ireland, and the Scots War are all excluded.  Cromwell is presented as a proto-democrat when nothing could be father from the truth.  The battles are all wrong, the costumes are nice but inaccurate (the New Model Army dressed in red coats -- the origin of the English Red Coat), for some reason many people are shown doing important things years after their death, Thomas Fairfax is relegated to a supporting role when he was Cromwell's superior for most of the period the move covers, and Cromwell is way to open to constitutional change.  Perhaps most of all Cromwell is represented at the end have a long, lasting legacy whereas Cromwell governed for five years and the Restoration pretty much wiped out everything the Commonwealth has achieved.  A fun fantasy but not to be taken too seriously.
