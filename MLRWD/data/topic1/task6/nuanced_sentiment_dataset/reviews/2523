Whoever was behind the marketing strategy of the DVD version of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was frightfully short sighted and just plain stupid.  If you are a collector and like musicals and want this movie in letterboxed format, forget it.  MGM has decided, "too bad, you don't get to have this one letterboxed."  Here's what I suspect MGM's myopic, warped logic is: "this is a movie for children and children just won't be able to handle those black bars on the TV screen - this just wouldn't be 'family friendly'. "  What a bunch of..., and what a regressive attitude on the part of MGM in an age of big screen TVs including the rising popularity of widescreen television.  Not to mention us collectors out of luck who want to have a copy of the film with it's integrity intact!  No!  We have no choice in the case of this title.  We have to put up with the horrific pan and scan transfer.  No thank you!  There's no logical reason why MGM couldn't offer an alternate widescreen transfer of this movie on DVD.  Hell, even Disney releases it's titles letterboxed!  This whole marketing strategy of the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang on DVD is so reactionary it makes me sick to my stomach.  I won't recommend this ugly pan and scan transfer to anyone.  Even my young children are upset that the DVD is not letterboxed!...
