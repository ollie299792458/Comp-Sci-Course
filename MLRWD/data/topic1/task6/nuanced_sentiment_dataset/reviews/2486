I just finished watching this film and loved every minute of it!  The storyline is heartfelt and brilliantly acted, the situation is realistic and believable where every subtle character nuance rings true.  The relationship between Goran and Sven is touching and true in every sense of the words.  It's difficult for two gay men to adopt a baby, and to be on the same page about adopting a baby, and are not always prepared for what might go wrong.  But, Fate really does work in mysterious ways and knows what it's doing when it comes to revealing character flaws as well as strengths.  Each of the three main actors are perfect pitch in their portrayal of who they are.  You will want all three to come out on top in their wants, needs, and desires.  I cannot recommend this film enough.  The subtitles are minimal, the nonverbal cues are perfect pitch.  I won't summarize the plot here because so many others already have.  IF you only are able to watch one moving heartfelt film this year that shows what makes a family bond...this is the film.
