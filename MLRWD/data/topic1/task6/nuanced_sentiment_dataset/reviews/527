Who said they didn't make 'em like this any more? It's curious that someone with the satirical genius of screenwriter Richard Curtis, who has brought us such bitingly mean and brilliant English staples like Black  Adder should have such a gift for charming romantic comedy. Following up on  his Four Weddings and a Funeral success, he goes 2 for 2 with Notting Hill,  the story of two people falling in love, Hugh Grant, just an ordinary guy,  and Julia Roberts basically playing herself but with admirable restraint  and vulnerability.
We are surrounded by the traditionally colorful  supporting cast, similar to "Weddings..", with special mention  going to the delightfully ignorant Bernie, played by Hugh Bonneville, and  Spike (Rhys Ifans), colorfully stealing scenes with personal-hygienically  challenged eccentricity.
It's well acted, Grant is likeable and  self-depreciating as always, Roberts gives her best performance in a comedy  since Pretty Woman and the plot is surprisingly plausible given the  premise. Highly recommended.
