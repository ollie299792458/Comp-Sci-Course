I thought that this movie had one of the best trailers of all time; it gave the impression of being a romantic film before revealing that you'd been deceived.  The trouble is, you are still deceived.  It gives the promise of being a horror film (especially with Craven directing) but it is really a thriller.  It is not a bad thriller, but it is not an especially great thriller either.

The premise: Beautiful Woman seated next to Attractive Guy on Airplane.  Instead of turning out to be her next boyfriend, he turns out to be a terrorist-for-hire, who is forcing her to make a phone call that will help kill a diplomat and his family.  If not, they will murder her father.  Most of the movie is occupied with the plane flight and the battle of wills between them.  Of course, in a concept movie like this, there has to be all sorts of distractions and unlikely happenings in order to give the movie momentum.  In the end, logic breaks down and it devolves into the standard "knife-weilding-bad-guy-chasing-the-heroin" picture.  Subtlety has never been one of Wes Craven's strong points.

Still the picture LOOKS great.  There are great performances from the leads.  I would have felt cheated in theaters, but it makes an OK rental.
