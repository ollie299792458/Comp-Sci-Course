I love Sandra Bullock but some of her films are hit and miss with me. This is my favorite one so I wanted to write a brief review. I think she should take a break from comedies and do another really great suspense thriller like this. Sandra Bullock plays Angela Bennett and the film makes you go through the nightmare that she does if one day your identity was suddenly deleted. And let's face it, we are living in a time where technology is moving at such a rapid pace and everything is so easily accessible on the internet. All our information is stored in the computer and with a few clicks of the keys, you can become someone else. It's really scary to think about. And that is what happens to Angela after she stumbles upon a conspiracy involving a high-powered, rich CEO. Before she knows it, she's running for her life trying to prove to everyone who she really is while uncovering the truth. Angela is a smart, strong woman and you really feel her frustration at what is happening. You are rooting for her the entire way to win out in the end and for the bad guys to lose. I highly encourage people to check this film out. It may seem slightly dated, but still has a lot of merit about how dangerous computers can be if they fall into dangerous hands. You may also want to check out some other Sandra Bullock thrillers, Murder by Numbers and Premonition.
