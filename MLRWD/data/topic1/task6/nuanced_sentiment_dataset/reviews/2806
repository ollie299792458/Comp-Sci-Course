After waiting years for a season set we finally are here. For those of you who dont know the story let me give you the short version: Years in the future Bruce Wayne aka Batman is retired. After some tragical events Terry McGinnis becomes the new Batman. But theres more here than what our eyes sees and once you are done with this series you better look for Justice League Unlimited Season 2 finale episode "Epilogue" in order to discover who Terry really is!!!Awesome release. Kudos to WHV for giving us such a superior set.

The pros:

-New box design. Saves lot of space, excellent colors, art and very practical.

-13 episodes compressed in 2 disks is a nice touch and good deal.

-Not too expensive, not too cheap for what we get

-Transfers are awesome

-Commentaries are kind of limited but very good

-The episodes themselves are the best here.

The cons:

-No chapter stops

-Kind of limited extras

Final rating: **** 1/2 stars.

Heres hoping we get season 2 vol. 1 or the complete season 2 sometime soon. Please add chapter stops WHV! You may consider getting BATMAN BEYOND: RETURN OF THE JOKER UNCUT VERSION once you are done with this series as well (What it before Justice League Unlimited episode Epilogue!!)
