The movie itself is alright.  I read reviews from film critics that absolutely panned this movie.  It's not but stands as a middle of the road mystery.  As you can read from the synopsis what the story is about, I won't go into too much detail about the movie.  Briefly, John Travolta and Madeline Stowe are warrant officers in the Military Police (CID) and investigate the murder of a female army captain, who happens to be the daughter of a prominent general who is retiring to enter into national politics.  She was found naked and tied spreadeagled to tent posts near a military training area.  The bizarre fact behind this murder is that despite the circumstances she was strangled and there is no evidence of a sexual crime as well.  The two detectives quickly discover that behind the outward appearance of the victim there lies a history of sexual exploits with numerous officers on the base, and a countless number of suspects that would want to have kept this a secret from wives and the general himself.
While the story itself is intriguing the characters themselves are not that well developed.  The background is believable but it doesn't draw you in like the best mysteries do.  "A Few Good Men" does a far better job of this.
The DVD itself contains some deleted scenes and an alternative ending which I found intriguing.  The scenes while short would have added an element to the movie that was best left on the cutting room floor.  Other DVDs I have rented provided additional scenes that were of no substance but were pretty much just spare footage.  I think this gives you a little more insight into the movie.  The ending isn't a different solution to the mystery just a different take on the final scene after the solution of the mystery.
In all, I would say that this isn't worth the purchase but isn't a bad rental.  The additional cut scenes make renting the DVD more worthwhile than a videotape.
