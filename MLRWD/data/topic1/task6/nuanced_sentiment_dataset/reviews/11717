First, imagination if you will, a college student out there, somewhere, decides to write a script that deals with the philosophy of evil.  Then that person gets some money.  Let us say, oh, five dollars or more.  Maybe more.  Maybe he found some coins in his Dad's old truck.  He runs over to a garage sale and buys a camera in which he stuffs in some black and white film.  Then he hires some of the best actors, like Christopher Walken, and some others to play in his story.  Then he films it.  Some scenes are in the street.  In fact most are.  But he does dish out some money for some better places.  Like restrooms and art museums.  More likely art stores.  No editors are involved.  Nobody of any skill is used to help in the movie but the actors, who has trash to work with and a director who is, as we have said before, a college student.  A poor college student who lives on cold pizza, looks for loose change in the gutter and sleeps on a park bench.
That is not what happened.  But that is what it feels like.  I have ignored movies.  There are vampire movies out there that I have fallen asleep while watching.  But I forced myself to continue to stare.  Or at least stay in the chair and try to understand them.  This movie made me so bored that a couple of times I almost turned it off.  I almost walked away to do cleaning.  CLEANING.  This film hurt to watch.  It made me feel pain.  It was so numbingly bad that I had to dream about vacuuming the floor to escape its sad, pitiful excuse for a story.  It has NO reason to exist.
