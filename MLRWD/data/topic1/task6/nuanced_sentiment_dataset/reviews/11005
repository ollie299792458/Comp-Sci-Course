This is probably the most revealing of all the Godzilla movies and makes the most sense regarding his powers.  The utter destruction he can wreak on the alien with his tremendous fire breath and his regenerative abilities both are very consistent with the story behind Godzilla's abilities as a monster.
He is practically indestructable because of his amazing regenerative cells and his nearly-impenetrable shielding skin/armour.  Also, the power he can pack into his fire breath is what people have come to expect from a super being like Godzilla.
On the more humourous side, we also learn - once and for all - that you DON'T get Godzilla mad as does the alien after their first encounter.  Godzilla simply comes back, angrier, meaner and more cunning than ever; he can adapt and learn from his previous mistakes and fights and teaches this "meteor thing" or whatever it is, a damned lesson:  You can't just expect to have the power and spirit of Godzilla by taking some skin cells from him and taking his form.  Godzilla is bigger than the sum his parts BY FAR!
A great movie.  Toho is finally making Godzilla stories which live up to the reputation of the very monster they created - an indestructable (or nearly indestructable as Godzilla can be badly hurt as we have already seen) super monster, created by human monstrosity (i.e. nuclear radiation resulting from atomic testing), come back to destroy humanity and all sources of the pollution which caused Godzilla to come into existence in the first place; almost like a modern-day version of the Frankenstein monster, except that the creature created by Frankenstein was initially a humble, innocent, beautiful, child-like human being not meaning any harm.  Whereas Godzilla is destructive right from the start...  
Enjoy!
