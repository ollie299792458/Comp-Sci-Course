When I first saw Cinema Paradiso back in my college years, I thought that this was one great credit requirement.  The film, with its lighthearted yet sublime tone, first stirred my senses to the beauty of Italian cinema-- and you never forget your first time.

Well, after viewing the director's cut (an added 50 minutes of additional footage never seen before), what was thought of as perfect is now nothing short of excellence.  I don't want to give out the details of the film as I wouldn't want to spoil the experience for new entrants into the wonderful world of Cinema Paradiso, but the ending simply made it for me.  I don't really care how other reviewers responded to the ending, be it "deus ex machina" or "better edited than not," but it came as a heartrending closure of an affair long past-- kind of like making amends with a fallen-out friend.

This DVD is an extremely satisfying movie experience that should be seen by avid filmgoers, enthusiasts, at least once in their lifetime.
