It's a very moving movie that's more than just about Vietnam. It's a movie about accepting the past and letting go.

Throughout the movie Jacob Singer, a Vietnam veteran, played greatly by Tim Robbins, one of my favorite actors, suffers from a series of horrifying nightmares. He sees demons everywhere: horrifying creatures with tails, horns, and faceless heads. He is nearly run over by a train and sees these faceless heads looking at him through every window and by a car. He also sees repeated visions of a night in Vietnam he has trouble remembering.

The movie shifts from these nightmare visions to the real world in which he lives with his girlfriend, a post office worker, to one vision in which he still lives with his wife and son who died in an accident.

As he's able to accept the truth of what happened in Vietnam and what happened to his son he, as his angelic doctor Louis tells him, is able to see the demons as angels helping him to let go of his life.

It's a great movie.
