The movie opens with movie sequals of stab 6&stab7 whibh are fictional titles sequals for the fictional rtab series whibh are based on the events of sidney prescott in the original scream movie before going into scre4m movie-they need to do away with the fake stab movies-. all 3 openings end with deaths. i did not like that because it was cheap and unoriginal and it had been done by craven many times:wes craven new nightmare, scream 2 and scream 3:. so that is a negative. the movie is watchable and the score is good along with the killer identity at the end is good but sidney has nothing to do gale is not fiesty and dewey is off pohnt in this movie. the movie take a jab at saw like saying we are better than saw4 when scream 2 ame 3 were crap. this is better than part 2 and 3 but bring nothing new and original to the series. if they dnd the series on this movie it will be good because they need to stop while they are ahead. this movie pokes fum at sequals and remakes but fail to not get draged down in living up past choppy sequals and remakes. this movie is cliched. heck the whole series besides part 1 is. this movie is better than 2 and 3 but weaker than part 1.
