Sure, the film might be a bit sappy at times.  And granted, there are a few occasions when you want to reach through the screen and slap the male characters in the head to tell them to get on with their lives.  Personally, though, it's still my favorite film.  One that I watch repeatedly and find myself quoting on a daily basis.
Full of snappy one liners ("Who are you Rex Harrison?"), memorable exchanges (Noah Emmerich's explosion, "You beat up my friend, you beat up me..."), and great performances by Natalie Portman, Timothy Hutton, Michael Rapaport and the entire cast make this an extremely pleasurable film experience.  
The beauty of Beautiful Girls is that it can be taken it at so many levels.  It contains everything from over the top pop culture references ("You gonna' watch 'Rich Man, Poor Man'...) and crude sophomoric humor (David Arquette as Bobby Conway), to literary references and cautious, yet effective handling of taboo societal discussions.  It's a guy movie, a date flick, a comedy, an ironic social commentary, a coming of age tale, and a remember-the-wonderyears film in one quirky and charming package.
