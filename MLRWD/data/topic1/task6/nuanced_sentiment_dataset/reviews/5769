Let me begin by saying The Wicker Man is one of my favorite movies...
A friend gave me this DVD and I was excited to see "The Wicker Man Enigma," the 32 minute "making of the movie" included here. HOWEVER I was blown away that the 88 minute "American release" version was featured on the rest of the DVD! Particularly after "The Wicker Man Enigma" went on about how the footage removed took so much away from the final film. I simply can't believe that no attempt was made by the producers of this DVD to use the longer version.
I have the 101 minute version on video and it is vastly superior. The movie makes much less sense in the 88 min copy. Chopped out bits include more background on Sergeant Howie (his fiancee, feelings about sex and deep religious convictions), how he received the letter about Rowan, not to mention other vital parts such as a scene with Lord Summerisle presenting a young man as a sexual offering to Willow and others. Also unfortunately abbreviated are many of the songs such as Willow's dance, Lord Summerisle and Miss Rose's song, etc. Some scenes are switched around to "make more sense" here, presumably after the film was butchered.
To anyone who has only seen the 88 minute version, I HIGHLY recommend trying to get a copy of the long version, it is like a completely different film. This is worthwhile only for "The Wicker Man Enigma."
