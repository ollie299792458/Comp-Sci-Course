"Gettysburg" is the movie adaptation of Michael Sharra's book "The Killer Angels," winner of the Pulitzer Prize.  The film is well acted, especially the roles played by Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, and Jeff Daniels.  As with most movies, "Gettysburg" cannot possibly capture the essence of the characters and the true emotion that the book so eloquently describes.  Director Ron Maxwell probably knew this going in, but chose to tackle the events, people, and emotions of the battle anyway.  He must be credited for the attempt, as it demonstrates a great courage in filmmaking.  What "Gettysburg" does is tries it's best to to communicate all of these events and emotions, and it comes through more often than not.  I've both read the book and watched the film several times, and I notice that Mr. Maxwell seems to capture more and more every time I watch it.  Particularly fascinating is Robert E. Lee's character (Sheen) and that of General Longstreet (Berenger) as they struggle to grapple with the historic implications of the decision to fight, and the consequences of the horrible losses they suffer.  The most stirring part of the film is the depiction of Col. Chamberlain's (Daniels) Maine troops defending Little Round Top on the second day of the battle.  Only the book, the movie, and actually visiting Little Round Top have put into perspective the savage fighting that took place there.  Kudos to Mr. Maxwell, and a film worth seeing.
