I am a big fan of Cole Porter and I was disappointed in this film, but it could have been a lot less entertaining.

I was disappointed in the way the songs were performed. The Amazon reviewer was right on target by stating that "The parade of celebrity singers were apparently chosen for their jarringly modern vocal mannerisms." Particularly annoying was the closing song, with enough swoops and scoops to make the audience seasick. Cole Porter's songs are best done simply because the lyrics and music sparkle ("...in shallow shoals English soles do it/goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it...).

Kevin Kline did an excellent job as Cole Porter.  He earned the film its three stars. However, the writing was wooden. I found it difficult to care much about the characters. I was confused about some of the action and I don't know what they were trying to do with his sexuality. He loved her, but he didn't, but he did, but not really... Come on, we're adults---all leading men in films don't have to have heterosexual tendencies.
