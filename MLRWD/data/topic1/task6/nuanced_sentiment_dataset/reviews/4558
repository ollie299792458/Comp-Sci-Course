If someone said to the average 13 year old that a new Shakespeare movie is coming out, and they are going to love it...they would probably respond with a stereotypical "WHATEVER!" However, if you give it a catchy name, hire the  cute boy from 3Rd Rock From the Sun, and make a trailer with ultra hip  banter, then you suddenly have a box office hit with the teens. 10 Things I  Hate About You is one of the best from this recent trend. 
  A modern adaptation of the Shakespeare  play "The Taming of the Shrew", stars  Julia Stiles as Katarina, the shrew that is  mentioned in the title. A virtual  newcomer to  the screen, this lady  has something that  most "teen stars"  (minus of course Leelee  Sobeski)  lacks...the ability to act. Her turn  as Kat is actually very refreshing, and as  someone who loves `Shrew" this is one of  the best people I have seen to play this  role. (Shakespeare purists, please hold off  your hate mails.) 
  The story revolves around Kat and her sister  Bianca (Larisa Oleynik). Bianca is beautiful,  the popular girl at school, who would have  everything she wants if it weren't for one  little dilemma. There is a family rule  that prohibits her from dating until unpopular, and borderline scary Kat,  gets a man of her own. So, an admirer of Bianca's hires someone to win  Kat's heart, so that he can take out Bianca. 
I am sure you are thinking  that isn't anything original here...and you are right there isn't. However,  it's tempo, and nonchalant references and odes to Shakespeare is what keeps  it going and makes it fresh. 
I recommend this film to anyone who is  looking for a little harmless fun.
