I won't comment on the film itself, since at this point you've probably read some of the reviews or you could go to imdb to read about the film itself.

As for the DVD itself, I must say it is rather disappointing, since it came in the Bette Davis box set with 4 others that didn't have the annoying things that are on this disc.  I will second the complaint(s) about the trailer. Upon inserting the dvd, I got a widescreen (letterboxed) trailer in color for a recent release which was significantly louder than the soundtrack for the film. I was able to stop it and go to the menu, but it does seem that someone did not take as much care in putting together this release as they did for the others. There was also a big hair in the top portion of the screen for a good 3 minutes or so (which seems more oversight than film damage), though otherwise the print looked excellent.  Another annoyance was that during the opening & closing credits the film is presented in letter boxed format, even though it's full frame. Then when the action begins the frame fills to the top of the screen.  This is really distracting & quite annoyed me at first since I had thought they letterboxed a full frame film. The sound quality is also a mixed bag. Midway through the film, particularly in the scene where Bette  & the lawyer visit the "pawn shop" the dialogue is inaudible. I had to turn my receiver to almost 10 to hear it. The inclusion of the alternate ending is nice, but there is no context in which to place it. Was there 2 theatrical releases? did someone change their mind? There's no commentary, liner notes or documentary bits on the making of the film or its release to give you any idea what the story is on the alternate ending.
