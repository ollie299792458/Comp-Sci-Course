Most of these movies, if not all are in the public domain and the prints that they've used here are to say the least, not the best in the world. As another reveiwer listed the quality of each I will not repeat it as I agree with their review. The collection is fine as the titles go, but I would use this as a list of movie to find and get a better copies and cuts and get the far better collection of the same titles. Many of these prints used here are the same as you get in those "Treeline Films 50 Movie Mega Packs" for around $15. Why pay nearly $63 when the same copies (prints) can be had for far less and get an extra 38 movies to boot?

I do reccommend for the movie fan that they see and understand the impact of these selected films at there time in history, but please do yourself a huge favor and find the better prints of these great classics! Here is a list of the same movies, but with far better prints of each so try these...

OK, yes this collection I have put together will cost far more than the $63.00 they want for the one reviewed, something close to $400.00 give or take. But it's apples and oranges, you can not compair the collection reveiwed here and the lack of quality thereof to the the ones I have listed here. Just as you can put lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig, you can put a bad print in a fancy box, it's still a bad print. I hope this helps the true collector.

Cinema History should be treated and presented better!
