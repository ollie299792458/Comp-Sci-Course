In Boston's Charlestown neighborhood, robbing banks and armored cars is a cottage industry. This is the story of one of The Town's Gen X crews. This crew is good.

The movie opens with a -- you guessed it -- bank robbery. The bad guys are wearing masks and everything goes according to plan -- until the crew's hothead loses his composure, attacks a bank employee and kidnaps another.

This was not part of the plan.

The kidnapped employee is let go, physically unharmed, but the crew discovers she lives in The Town. Did she see something or hear someting that could identify them to the FBI? Will she recognize one of them at a local pub, laundromat or grocery store and call the police? The crew's ramrod decides to find out, before the crew's hothead solves the problem with murder. Problem is, Ramrod falls in love with the vic.

This was not part of the plan

Now, for the first time, Ramrod starts to see how he could lead a different way of life. But, for now, he's stuck in his current job. This conflict create's the story's central drama. I won't tell you if the conflict is resolved, or how, but if you see this movie you will have fun, and an interesting time, finding out.

The Town is lean and intense, and at times very violent.But the violence seems fairly real. People who get shot actually bleed and sometimes die. When vehicles crash people actually get hurt. The acting is first rate. The movie looks like, feels like and sounds like Boston (my favorite cold weather American city). In fact, it all seems real, quite an achievement given that the love story aspect is improbable.

If you like lean, intense crime thrillers with a love story on the side, this movie is for you. If you don't, well, see it anyway. It's that good.
