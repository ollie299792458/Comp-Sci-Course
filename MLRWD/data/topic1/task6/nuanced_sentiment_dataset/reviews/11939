I expected a lot from this film! Man, you've got Jolie and Freeman and this promising McAvoy. Plus, it is directed by the same man who created Night Watch and Day Watch (two really enjoyable and open-minded urban-fantasy films). This film is disappointing, no matter how hard I try to appreciate its inventions, Matrix-like moves and sensuality that Jolie brings to any movie. Too bad, 'Wanted' is just mediocre when it could've been great a movie.
The story is simple, characters are far from simple (where the hell all these assassins come from?), but the movie focuses on being simple. Main characters are pretty interesting, but these different characters are sacrificed way too easily. Or, maybe it's just the fact that there's no real chemistry between McAvoy and Jolie?! I expected the worst from the start and it doesn't go very far from that. The movie aims for the sequel, that's for sure. I really hope Jolie manages to find a better script, a film that really knocks my brains out. She has all the qualities for doing a film that would be the future's classical action film. This film is not what I wanted.
