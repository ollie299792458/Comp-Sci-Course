Finally, the last true film noir gets the treatment it deserves. It goes without saying that 8 years ago Universal did a great job, when 'Touch Of Evil' was released in a version restored to Orson Welles' original vision. However, butchered as it may have been when the studio took it away from Welles back in 1958, I still have fond memories of the theatrical version, especially the famous opening sequence.
In this sequence, which was filmed in one continuous take lasting 3 minutes and 20 seconds, the camera follows a car with a bomb in its trunk that eventually will explode, just after the car has passed the Mexican-American border. On the soundtrack of the theatrical version, this sequence was accompanied by an evil oozing theme written by Henry Mancini, full of rattling congas and a menacing dialogue between the horns.
For the restored version, Mancini's title theme has been skipped. Welles felt the threatening atmosphere would be better established by sound effects and source music coming from the surroundings, such as car radios, footsteps, and snippets of dialogue.
In my opinion, both versions have their merit. Compare them in this 50th anniversary edition (which also includes the preview version), and you'll agree that both Welles and Mancini had an evil touch.
