Just thought I would bring a matter to the attention of those interested in this set, especially those who already own it. Though of course each of the three versions of CE3K are offered with the DTS audio option in the languages menu (as was the case with the original DVD release) the set I own returns to the default Dolby Digital 5.1. And it is the case with ALL THREE of the discs. I highlight "DTS 5.1", then select play, and trying this numerous times, but is still playing in DD 5.1. Just in case, to check to see whether if it is my Pioneer DVD player that is acting up, I tried several other DVDs (including the above-mentioned first DVD release of CE3K) and they are accepting the selection. So my question to any owners of this set would be: Does anyone else experience this, or might I regard this as just a isolated defect for the set I own? I do plan to exchange the set to see if another one would have this same issue. Though I feel the DD 5.1 quite adequate in most instances, I do find (to my ears at least) that the DTS audio is often more rich and has a more seamless surround perspective. Regardless of one's preference, I want of course what I pay for in any product, per the advertisement.

Anyone else encounter this problem? Feedback on this issue will be greatly appreciated from fellow CE3K enthusiasts.

As an aside--I do prefer the original theatrical version as the best of the three offered, but it's neat to have all three available, and the poster diagram included (reverse of the great theater poster) is useful to refer to at, at least initially to sort out the cuts and additions.
