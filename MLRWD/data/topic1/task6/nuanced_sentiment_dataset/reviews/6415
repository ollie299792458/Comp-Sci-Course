First off, don't get me wrong... this seasonal favorite is great! But, I won't get into the movie. Others have expressed the same joy I get from this movie every year. What bugs me is the FACT this is NOT the true aspect ratio. As others have noted the double-disc WIDSCREEN version is cropped pan & scan version of the movie. Case in point, near the begining of the movie when the kids are at "Higbee's" you can see the so-called widscreen edition is cropped from the pan & scan. If you have this edition, compare the sides with the red and black hats on the store displays and the tops of the heads on the cutomers looking in. Shame on "Warner Brothers" for doing this diservice to their customers and having the AUDACITY to put on the package that the widescreen edition "preserves the theatrical aspect ratio of it's original theatrical exhibition" -- BUNK!. Thank God I still have my laserdisc in the proper aspect ratio. If you are a true cinefile, DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION! Save your $$$ and watch it on TNT or TBS! Thank God I bought this used for far less!
