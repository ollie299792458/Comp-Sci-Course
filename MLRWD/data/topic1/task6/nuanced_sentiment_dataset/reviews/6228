The Not-Too-Revealing Synopsis:

A class of elite FBI students are given mock crimes to analyze and profile.  When a test becomes dangerous the students start to question their teacher and each other.

Review:

The scenario drew my interest:  a whole group of promising mindhunters working together. The possibilities were many - who will they take on?  what could a group do that a single profiler could not?  Disappointingly a bulk of the movie takes place in one limited location and the group-possiblity is never played out.  It is completely a guess-the-bad-guy kind of movie with a score of misdirections and twists thrown in.  If you  enjoy guessing at who done it and what will happen next then it is a thrilling movie.  The dangers and scenarios are implausible and simply do not make sense in the context of the characters and their professions though so you will ruin it for yourself if question the plot or characters on any level.  I would not suggest watching it if you are only  interested in seeing Val Kilmer or Christian Slater as their screen time is limited.  The other characters were not especially interesting and I think the director failed in their development.
