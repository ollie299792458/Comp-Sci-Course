If you are intersted in becoming a good salsa dancer youre worries are over.  Why go out and spend a whole bunch of time and money on dancing classes when you could do it in the privacy of youre own home.  This DVD takes advantage of one of the best features available but never used by others which is the multi-angle feature.  This feature allowes the watcher to experience the instructions from three different angles.  In return the watcher is able to see every aspect of the body positioning while dancing salsa.  It is no news that sooner or later every dance DVD will copy and use technology, but why wait if it is already out there.  If you are a person that think they have two left feel this DVD will prove that stylish salsa dancing is only as hard as you make it seem.  Through meticulous step by step instructions The Quick and Dirty Guide To Salsa lets anybody explore this raw, sensual, Cuban salsa style dance.  I my self do not consider my self of being a great dancer but after a few weeks of practicing with the instructions of this DVD have become a much confident dancer on the dance floor.  I know this because I have been recieving many compliments at some of the hottest Latin Salsa clubs in New York city even though I am Jewish.  My rating of this DVD is two thumbs up.  You will not believe the results and the satifaction that this film provides.
