This is a hilarious movie because it has a Black man and a Chinese man in the lead roles.

We don't usually see people from these two ethnic groups interacting.

And therein lies the premise of the movie.

I've got some ideas for Rush hour 3.  How about teaming an Eskimo with an Australian Aborigine.

Or how about a crusty veteran Swedish policeman  teamed with an eager rookie cop who just happens to be a Yanomamo Indian from Brazil.

The movie practically writes itself:

{Sven (the Swedish cop) turns on the radio}

Sven: Let's listen to ABBA.

Kobali (the Yanomamo Indian Cop): Oh hell no. You didn't just touch my damn radio!

Sven: ABBA is great Swedish music.

Kobali: ABBA is gonna get you a great ass whuppin', don't you ever touch a Yanomamo Indian's radio, boy! You can do that in Sweden but you can get your ass killed out here, man.

{Kobali tried to pick up girls in Swedish}

Kobali: All I did was invite them to have a drink.

Sven: You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.

Kobali: Which word was 'goat'?

{During a fight scene with a bunch of Swedes after accidentally punching Sven}

Sven: Kobali, why did you hit me!

Kobali: All y'all's look alike!
