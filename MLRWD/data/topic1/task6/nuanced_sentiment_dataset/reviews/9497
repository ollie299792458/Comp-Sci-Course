On the surface, Flesh + Blood (we should be immediately suspicious of the title's 'unique' typographical choice) looks like a brainless good time - Italian condottieri form a band of thieves and pillage across the Italian countryside, kidnapping a nobelman's daughter who falls in instant lust with the leader of our rapine band, essayed by Rutger Hauer with all the charisma of week-old socks. Only the countryside is actually Spanish and the rest of the movie is equally authentic. Peter Verhoeven, whose movies display a uniquely hateful attitude towards women, directs with the deft hand and restrained sensibilities that made his later directorial effort Showgirls so memorable. Particularly repugnant is the scene in which 20-ish Jennifer Jason Leigh is stripped naked and group-raped by Hauer's band only to find herself turned on by her own rape. Offensive is not a strong enough word to describe the treatment of the women in this film and the men fair little better - either swaggering soldiers or sniveling scholars. In conclusion: a film to be avoided at all costs by anyone possessing sense, sensibility or both.
