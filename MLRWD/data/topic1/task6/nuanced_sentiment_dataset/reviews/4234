This is a very cheesy bad Syfy channel tv monster (crocodile) movie. I couldn't get it to play in my RCA blu-ray player. The player needs to be updated. The directions for updating were a bit misleading- I guess I need to get broadband and a router. It did play on my girlfriend's samsung player. She didn't like this movie. This is a fairly typical Syfy type movie, but a little more R-rated. Don't expect great or even decent special effects. Don't expect stars from the original Lake Placid. The acting is a little uneven. John Schneider is decent. Cloris Leachman hams up her role. Leachman's character feeds the crocodiles who grow and start eating people. Most of the young people are OK. The photography is good. The colors are good. The script should have been better. If you are a Syfy tv fan with low expectations you might find this movie to be mildly entertaining. There are actually worse Syfy movies! (faint praise I know!) If you are not a fan of Syfy tv movies you won't like this.  This is the kind of movie that is fun to make fun of - what dumdum will be eaten next? But watching this movie may lower your IQ. Thanks
