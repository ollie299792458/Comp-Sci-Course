I am a huge fan of martial arts cinema and have been for the majority of my 25 years in existence. I've tracked down and seen every notable martial arts film made up until now from all corners of the earth. When I first saw this film in 1998, I hailed it as the greatest martial arts film I've ever seen.  There have been a plethora of films released since then but this film still stands as the greatest in the history of this genre.

The fight scenes are an example of exactly what a martial arts film is supposed to be.  Flawless choreography, pin-point execution, blinding speed, unique and innovative techniques. Every fight scene is well detailed and perfectly shot, none are too long and none are too short. The main thing that sets this film above all others however is that each fight scene tells a story in and of itself.  It's just absolutely brilliant and breathtaking to watch.

This is Jet Li and martial arts cinema at its absolute best. There has never been a better martial arts film and there likely never will be. A must watch.
