Clearly made to impress people with visual effects more than to educate and inspire, and I felt for the bait being a fan of other National Geographic series such as "Ancient Megastructures" thinking they can't go wrong here. Ultra obnoxious music and sound effects that makes you squirm through the whole duration, same was the narrator Pertwee who seems to try to scare you and at the sametime ramble and drone obnoxiously on and on for 90minutes nonstop. (There is a version with Alec Balwin instead.) Gives me a headache from the space travel effects which happens about every 20-30 seconds and the amount of craps the narrator are spewing out. "If, may be, perhaps, what if", these speculations makes up most of the film. If you must see beautiful images of the universe without the science, just use a search engine to get real images. This documentary made of almost entirely CGI which are outdated looking considering the funding available from an entity such as National Geographic. However if you like to experience a bad trip, watch this documentary.

Base on other reviewers recommendation I'll look up The Universe series instead.
