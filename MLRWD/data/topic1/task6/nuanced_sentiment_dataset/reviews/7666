This is a great movie..but maybe that is only becuase I love classical music. Although, the music was changed(butchered) to met the needs of time, the compilement of the music was fantastic. Yes, I watched the original Fantasia when I was little and thought it was great, but that doesn't mean that we must compare the original to this one! Yes, the segments were shorter, but jeez, come on, some of those segments in the original Fantasia were a bit too long and easily forgetful...i.e. Stravinsky "rite of spring" and Beethovens "Pastoral symphony."  These segments are great ways for children to see something fun,discover the beauty of classical music, and even have a tender parent-child conversation about. This movie was made for the children of today(not adults), not of yesteryear, so stop griping about it.
Personally my favourite segment is The Stedfast Tin Solider with Shostakovich's Piano Concerto 2, followed by Daisy and Donalds segment with Elgars Pomp and Circumstance..but they were all great!! As a person learning of the classical music genre, this film has helped me have points to jump off and do research and find music!
