"Forces of Nature", interesting chemistry between two talented actors with a slightly above average love story.
I was first recommended the movie by a friend.  I guess many of us guys who plan to get married  should watch this movie because it does hit straight for your heart.
The  movie itself is not the greatest love story but it's nevertheless pretty  good.  I wondered before the movie on how the chemistry between Affleck and  Bullock would be and in my opinion the two did pretty well for their  characters. &amp;#63728;&amp;#63728; The movie showed a lot of colors but  many times it's dark.  I wonder why the director chose this and thus I wish  they added a director's commentary with this DVD.
According to the  booklet, this movie was shot before Affleck's popularity which was  interesting.  The special effects for the movie are well done and sound  good in your 5.1 digital surround system.  But where the movie is a little  above average and the sound and video well done (I noticed just a little  artifacts but nothing severe). 
A letdown for the DVD was in the extras  department.  Hardly any.  But I have seen worse and I'm just glad they  included the deleted scenes, trailers and featurette.  
The alternative  ending was quite interesting and I'm glad they left it out.  It would of  ruined the movie I think.
All in all, it's your average love story on DVD  but I give it a slightly above average rating for the twist and the ending.  
For those who have friends who are thinking about marriage and thinks  about it continuously like I have, let your friend borrow the DVD or tell  him to buy it.  Because this movie in a way somewhat makes us evaluate our  own relationships.
