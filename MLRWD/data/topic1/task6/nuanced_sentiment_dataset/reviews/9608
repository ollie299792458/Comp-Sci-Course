First off, this is NOT a horror movie! It's a metaphoric mess! The entire movie is displayed in puzzles & riddles. The best way to describe this mess is, "It's like reading an abstract poem & trying to figure it out". The movie is VERY SLOW & to someone who does not understand metaphors will truly hate it. I truly understand metaphoric movies but this one was not executed well at all, very boring & not creative, I Truly hated every minute of it. The message of this movie has already been made before with other titles, clearly making it not original. The movie keeps advancing from a birthday party to a hospital, a birthday party to a hospital, a birthday party to a hospital, I think you get the point. I could not wait for this movie to end. I found this mess in a dump bin & I guess, dump bin clearly means that. The interviews were a joke as well, unprofessional & the sound quality was lacking,... editing, what editing, who ever edited the interviews should have eliminated the questions that were asked in a very low audio level & when the interviewee was asked to repeat his answer that as well was not edited, you hear the answer twice in some spots. Overall this movie was a mess, a complete disaster & I feel many of the reviewers on Amazon feel the same way as I do. Schroeder(Publsher/Owner) of Cult Movies Magazine and Orbital Traxx Records.
