This movie wasn't all that it could've/should've been, especially with certain characters. Venom should have had more screen time, maybe a whole movie. At times it does seem crammed full of too much siht but hey, I go to movies to be entertained, not deeply involved with characters I've seen countless times before. Honestly I hated Spiderman 2. I don't care what others say but SM2 had waaay too much dialouge and not enough of what you expect with a superhero movie, which is the superhero. The movie takes place in New York (of course) and we see Peter and MJ spending time together. Okay skip the useless dialougue here and there we find out Uncle Ben's real killer, see 3 new villians (some cut short in terms of how involved in the marvel universe they are), and see a meteorite crash in Central Park, which, as we soon see, carries a nasty alien. This leads to the black suit, which causes Spiderman to experience mood swings and violent behavior.  This movie had several bleh moments (Peter Parker dancing.....never again) and at times the cast seemed bored. They should have worked the villians into separate films to show more of their developemnt rather than more of a bitchy MJ and a nerdy Peter. Other than that it's entertaining and is worth a view or two.
