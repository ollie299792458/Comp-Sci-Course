I was hesitant on seeing this, partly because I had never heard of it or seen reviews of it on TV before, but my mom reluctantly dragged me to the show to see it. Was I surprised.
Hugh Grant plays an amazing character, the male version of Bridget Jones, or so I think. His commentary throughout the movie at random points made me laugh, and I love the "SPAT" meeting. The boy in the film did an amazing job, and the bond that forms between him and Will is great. After I saw the movie, I bought the book, and both were equally impressive. No one could have played this role better than Grant, he's perfect for it. This is probably one of his best films, if not the best. 
When it comes out on DVD, I strongly suggest getting it, or rent it first, and I guarentee you will love it. I was hesitant on seeing it, and I was extremely surprised and pleased!!!
The soundtrack is also amazing, done by "Badly Drawn Boy". I suggest getting it if you're a fan of the film, because every song in the film is on the soundtrack.
