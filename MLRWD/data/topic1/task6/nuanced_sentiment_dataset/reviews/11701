Superman is an idiot and Lex Luthor is in the right in this movie. That's how bad it is.

Let me explain.

DC got so stupid that at one point someone said it was a good idea to have mastermind and supervillain Lex Luthor, bane of the DC universe, become President of the United States. Mistake number one.

Now that he is President, there's a giant meteor coming to Earth, and Lex Luthor publicly asks for Superman's help. So they agree to a meeting. Lex Luthor brings along a robot guy with a Kryptonite power source. And you know what, this makes perfect sense. The President has his Secret Service to protect him from anything that may harm him. That means people with guns who want to assassinate him, or superheroes who tend to get retarded under the pen of Jeff Loeb. So good, have your kryptonite-powered bodyguard to slow down Superman a bit.

When Superman meets up with Lex Luthor, he immediately grabs Lex and tells him he's on to him and starts acting like an idiot. It doesn't matter if you're DC Jesus, you don't tug on the President and make threats. So Superman starts feeling weary because of the kryptonite cyborg dude, and Lex runs away, there's a fight that Superman should have lost and been humiliated for and then sent to his Fortress of Solitude to think about what he's done afterward.

Superman's actions in this movie are so mind boggling that it's difficult to describe what makes them so stupid. Every step Superman takes seems to be so Jeff Loeb can show how awesome Batman is. I know this isn't the comic, but it's based off the comic, so Jeff Loeb's getting the blame. After finishing Hush and The Long Halloween, it's not undeserved.

If you want a great Superman in the DC animated universe, watch The Justice League, The Justice League: Unlimited, anything but this crap.
