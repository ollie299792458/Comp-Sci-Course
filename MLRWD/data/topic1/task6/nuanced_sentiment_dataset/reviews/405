It's been a while since I've seen something this bad. That may be because it's been about 20 years since someone MADE something this bad! This movie could have been made in the 1980s. I'm not talking about a throwback to the 80s, as other reviewers are claiming. You could literally take this movie back to the 1980s, show it, and not a single person would notice it was from 2009. No one in the movie uses a modern cell phone, laptop computer, PDA, or mp3 player; most of the cars are from the 80s. (I think they used very old stock footage for general traffic scenes - I saw cars I haven't seen in a decade). The jackets worn by the bad guys are straight out of a Michael Jackson video. The cordless phones are HUGE. The lead bad guy is the only anachronism and that's because he could be from the 1970s, his look, his dialogue, everything. (And yet, inexplicably, Mutsaka has modern night vision goggles, used consistently in situations where there's enough ambient light to render them useless.)

Unless you're a diehard afficianado of bad martial arts films, avoid. There are better acting and fight scenes in "Kung Fu Panda," and fewer plot holes as well.
