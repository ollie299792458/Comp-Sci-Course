A dissapointingly poor sequel, which in many ways proves to be worse than "Jason Takes Manhatten".

Ignoring the events of that, and most of the previous films, this takes place back at Crystal Lake, although Jason features in it very little. With the exception of the first and last 5 mins, the rest of the film is spent showing Jason's "soul" leaping in and out of other peoples bodies in a bizarre plot twist ripped directly off "The Hidden".

On the plus side however, Kane Hodder returns as Jason (what little we see of him) and as this release is of the unrated version, boasts some of the series most gory killings. But is really one for completists and die hard fans of the series only.

If you were looking at adding this film to your collection, this US DVD by New Line is at present the best version to go for as it contains both the unrated directors cut and R-rated theatrical version, along with directors commentary track, theatrical trailers and deleted scenes that were only used in the TV version.

The only thing it doesn't contain is the original intended sequence during the police ambush in which the undercover female cop pulls out a gun from under her bath towel and fires the first shot, but apart from that the disc has everything to keep collectors happy!

I'm giving this disc 3 out of 5 stars for the extras on the disc, rather than the film itself.
