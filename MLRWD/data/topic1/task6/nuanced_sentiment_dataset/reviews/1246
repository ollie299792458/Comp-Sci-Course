Four stars for nudity.

 This is a couple hours of my life I will never get back. Extremely slow moving with very little purpose or intent. If you are interested in the nudity, don't hold your breath, although worth the wait in some cases, it was almost halfway into the film before any nudity was present. The ending made no sense and there were a number of snags in the story that served no purpose. The only point in this film seems to be the far too late to appreciate it's artistic movement between the films of the past and the character's fascination by the silver screen. The viewer is left too busy wondering "What the....?" to enjoy any fleeting moments of nudity either. I will admit, I was almost impressed by the use of the classic films to drive the story, until they ended and the scenes interjected ad no impact on the plot whatsoever. Verdict, not worth the money and I can see why this film never even hit the Ritz theaters here, in Philly. I should have waited until cable.
