This is a big pile of Der'mo'''
It is nothing more than a re-do of the same old
tale of a bunch of men riding in on horses and killing
everyone but one kid who then grows up and yada, yada.
It is nothing but a badly pieced together film with chopped
up fight scenes that have no cohesive breadth in any part of
the film. There is not one fight scene that does not use multiple
cut-a-ways to make you think that someone is actually fighting someone
else.
In many of the scenes, you can actually see the group of people waiting
just before action is called; GIVE ME A BREAK!
How anyone could give this piece of junk anymore than one star is
beyond me.
Did you watch the same film as I did???????????
From chopped up scene, to chopped up scene, there is no way to figure
out an actual plot (you other reviewers know what a plot is don't you?).
You flip through scene after scene and if you are lucky, two or three scenes in
a row make some sense.

Hopefully this is the first and last Russian film I try to sit through!
The only reason I had this film is because it came with a two film set
with Outlander (the film I wanted) and only cost another three bucks.
The only problem, is that Wolfhound is not worth three cents!
