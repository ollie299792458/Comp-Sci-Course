How come the mainstream media loves this film? I thought it was a sad and sorry excuse for making a conventional heterosexual love-story without being 'politically incorrect'. It is NOT a film about lesbians and it is definitely NOT a film about same-sex love. Yet the media and many others persist in defining 'same-sex FRIENDSHIP' as lesbian - as if lesbian lovers are just friends and don't desire each other sexually. Now, in the end, the bisexual girl dumps the tedious straight chick for not wanting to have sex with her and that is good, but the main plot is not about that - it's about the straight girl 'finding her way back' from confused sexuality to the love of her ex-ego boyfriend. It is also about the anxieties about coming-out (as if we needed some straight women telling us about that...) and this is filmed in the least credible way: the daugther does not even have to say anything because her conservative, androcentric, Jewish mother has already guessed that she's 'gay'. As if that is likely to happen in real life? You can write 'I'm a lesbian' on your fore-head and most mothers are still able to disregard it...
There is nothing radical about this film - it is merely reproducing heteronormative assumptions about lesbians (Jessica Stein is even afraid of having coffe with a 'real lesbian' and doesn't feel comfortable until her date confesses that she has not dated women before either...and they don't have sex until they've asked two straight guys what they think about chicks having sex with each other - as if the 'male gaze' or 'male permission' were the only ways to get them going.). It is a film that straight people can watch without feeling threatened and still feel 'liberal' and 'gay-friendly'. The rest of us will do better off just [dismissing] Jessica Stein all together. Or analyse it in women's studies class.
