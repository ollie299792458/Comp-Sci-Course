Okay i remember when this was advertised in the theater, and i remember that i really wanted to see it, because i quite enjoyed the first one.  I think my Aunt or sumbody got this for me at Christmas Time the year it came out and i watched it rite after we opened all of our present.  i was so ready for it, i was ready to be scared, or at least some what frightened...but please, i've seen disney movies scarier than this.  First of all the acting was terrible...it looked like they tried to imitate the first movie by getting a black dude (Ice Cube from the first movie) and a hispanic woman (J. Lo form the first one).  Second of all...the plot was so retarted....and 3rd of all, the snakes looked too fake.  I mean i figured they wouldnt get real snakes, but at least try and make them looked semi scary!  i wasn't scared at all.  I just expected so much out of this movie...maybe that why it sucked so much, because of my high expectations.  In my opinion...the only reason you should RENT, not buy, this movie is to laugh at how stupid it is.  They should've marketed it as a comedy.
