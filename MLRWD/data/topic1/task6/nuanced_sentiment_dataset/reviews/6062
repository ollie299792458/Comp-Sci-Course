I'm not too sure what Kevin Smith and co. were thinking with this one. It was a bit weird and overly offensive, even for Kevin Smith. I first rented the movie because of the cast list on the back cover: Brian O'Halloran of `Clerks' starred (where he's known for his role as Dante), along with Smith himself, Jason Mewes, and a few other Smith-movie regulars (the infamous Walt "the fanboy" has a very significant role). But overall I was more than disappointed. And to be honest, a bit sickened. I love Kevin's movies; all of them, just not this one (even the underground `A Better Place' was more pleasurable than this) . I'd recommend 'Vulgar' only to anyone who is a HUMONGOUS fan of Kevin Smith and the supporting actors who appear in small roles in his other films. God, I can't even begin to imagine what the unrated version would be like. And I don't want to. This is not a comedy. This is not like `Clerks', `Mallrats', `Chasing Amy', `Dogma', or `Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back'. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is for the decent cast and the "faster than Walt Flanagan's dog" reference. Before you think about watching this movie, ask yourself if you'd enjoy watching a poor, pitiful clown get brutally raped by two kids and their father. Otherwise, skip it.
