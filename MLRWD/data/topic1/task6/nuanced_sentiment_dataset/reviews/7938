"Soylent Green" and "The Loved One" meet Doctor Who! "Revelation of the Daleks" shows the strengths of both a 45-minute episode format and the Colin Baker era. Although, it isn't Eric Saward's best script, in fact, Saward does a nice job of aping a Robert Holmes script, with double-play acts from hell! Good thing the acting is top notch! It boast a wonderful guest cast that includes Eleanor Braun, Clive Swift, Alexi Sayle and William Guant to name a few. Though some might complain that there isn't enough of the Doctor or the Daleks in this story. But like "Genesis of the Daleks", "revelation" is a Davros story, trying to regain his power and control of the Daleks by recreated new ones from bodies left at Tranquil Repose. The DJ scenes are very odd for the program, but refreshing. Terry Molloy steals the show playing just the head of Davros in glass casing for more than half the story! Clive Swift as the Chief Embalmer is just wonderful. His lusting over Peri is quite exceptable unlike Mestor in "The Twin Dilemma". Looks great, sounds great, a must see and get!
