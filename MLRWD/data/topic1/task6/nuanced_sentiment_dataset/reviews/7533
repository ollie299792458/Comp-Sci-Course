The second 3 episodes are true to the book and quite good after the first 3 episodes floundered- mischaracterizing Fanny and Aunt Norris among the worst offenses. It's as if they were writing the script as they went, finally figuring out what to do half way through. I've just read the book so I know Aunt Norris' self-centered meanness, pivotal in our sympathies to Fanny do not suddenly develop half way through the book... and even worse, Fanny does not develop quiet intelligence and prettiness of her own suddenly half way through but it is there but ignored by everyone but Edmond.  This is a major flaw which changes in episode 4.

A word of warning!  The characterization of Aunt Bertram with a whiny voice and insane expression is not only wrongly done but difficult to watch so ignore it if you can. It is the only major flaw of the production that lasts throughout.

Once the actors were given a script that made sense in the second 3 episodes and the director figured out how to make the actors more appealing physically by camera angles, hair style etc, they did quite well whatever their flaws. Sir Thomas is especially good.

This is the only Mansfield Park production fully worth watching.  The newer Masterpiece is butchered beyond belief and the movie is not true to the spirit let alone the letter of the book.  I would say though, there was some fun in considering all the times the scriptwriter of the movie asked him or herself, how should I change the story to surprise the reader of the book and what fun sport that is... actually, sometimes it made the story more realistic, which was indeed interesting, but since when was total realism the thematic point of any Austen novel and especially this one.
