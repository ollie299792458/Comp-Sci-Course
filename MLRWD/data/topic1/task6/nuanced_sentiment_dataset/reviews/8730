It seems that people are split on these movie, and naturally they all think that the people on the other side are complete morons with brains unfit (or perfectly fit?) for human bodies.
This can probably be chalked up to fact that the movie IS a very arrogant movie made by an arrogant director.  But arrogance by itself doesn't doom a movie.  In fact, since everyone seems to think they are "above-average" in intelligence, then why should Mamet, who is very intelligent be vilified for reflecting that attitude in his movies?
It's interesting that many people decided to rip on Pigeon's acting. Perhaps I was wrong, but I thought that her "wooden"-ness reflected excellent acting. In that "wooden"-ness I saw a character who possessed extreme contempt for the ibecile nature of Scott's character to the point that she can not bear to play the role assigned to her in the con.  Whether or not the viewer likes her choice of words or manner, it is the manner that she was expected to play in the context of the con.  
Once again, Scott's character is supposed to be stupid. While many of the negative and positive reviews are simply differences in taste, I noticed that many, especially of the negative reviews took major exception to Scott's character's stupidity. Just because you don't see yourself falling for a con, doesn't mean that it would never happen to anyone or that it wouldn't make an interesting story. 
This is certainly not the case with all of the negative reviews, but many of them seem to find the reviewer trying to live the role of the main character. This seems to be what most of the more popular films are geared for. Perhaps that's why we always get all of these ridiculous flix with undeveloped heroic main characters.  In this case, if you do that, naturally the film would be very insulting.
