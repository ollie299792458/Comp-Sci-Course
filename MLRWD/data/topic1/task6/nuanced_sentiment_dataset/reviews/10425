well, what can I say, although the movie is rated PG-13+ anyone can enjoy it from different angles.  
  The movie kicks off with a boyband named 'Du-jour' which happens to be taking piss out of massed produced music industry.  A garage band 'The Pussycats' is formed by three girls with very contrasting personalities was given an opportunity to become a rockstar and their debut single climbs up to the top of the chart in a matter of week.  But there is something fishy happening behind the hidden curtain.
  The soundtrack for this movie contains indie pop almost like female version of Blink182, the main vocal is sung by Kay Hanley from Letters to Cleo.  Each song is very catchy and provides energetic atmosphere.
  Extra features include behind the scene, deleted scenes and movie clips which I am sure will make you laugh.  Directors' commentary explains the footage of the movie in detail and also fun to listen to.

Overall it is very fun movie to watch at any occasions.  If you think it is just stupid, that's ok because it is a movie for people with GSOH.
