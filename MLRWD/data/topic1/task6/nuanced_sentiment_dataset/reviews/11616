For being a Madonna film this movie is quite decent.  It is not that bad.  I actually liked this movie and not just because I am a Madonna fan.  This is actually in my opinion the first decent and nice movie that Madonna has done since her 1987 Who's That Girl.  I think that The Next Best Thing is a much better and more enjoyable movie to watch than the boring Evita for which so much cammotion was made over it and even won Madonna an award.
Being that this is a Madonna film The Next Best Thing is a very pleasant movie to watch with the whole family.  It is a movie that the whole family can sit together and enjoy watching.  The movie is clean and deals with a modern day issue that focuses on alternative family situations.  Both Rupert Everett and Madonna give good performances though Madonna's acting skills could be improved.  Madonna gives a reasonably well performance that eludes her rather [bad] acting skills. In some scenes Madonna looks like she is acting, her movements are stiff, but manages to get by with an average performance.  The real highlight of the film is the handsome Rupert Everett.  He gives a wonderful performance and one which makes you sympathize with his character in the film and love him.  Rupert Everett is the Best Thing in the Next Best Thing.  A nice and pleasant movie to watch.
