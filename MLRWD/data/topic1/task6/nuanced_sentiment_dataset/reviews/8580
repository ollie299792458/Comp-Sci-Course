I remember about twenty years ago, most Christian movies were about the rapture or Biblical characters. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but the acting and the cinematography were average at best. "The Last Sin  Eater" is a great family film, with a wonderful message about Christ's redemption of mankind. I really liked the actors, especially  Liana Limberto performance. She really made Cadi Forbes a very believable
character. I also enjoyed the music in the film, as well, as some of the scenery. I would not recommend this for younger children, maybe ten and under. It was a little spooky at times, but not in a horror film kind of way. It was mostly just the subject matter of death, and the graveyard scenes that might be scary for some kids. I would recommend this film to anyone, especially those who were "Little House On The Prairie" fans. I kept thinking throughout the film how much it reminded me of "Little House". Perhaps, it is because the director is Michael Landon's son. In the end, I would say give "The Last Sin Eater" a chance, and when you watch it remember how far Christian films have come and be thankful.
