This is overall an enjoyable and fairly faithful adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's well-loved book, but it, like the other filmed versions, has its problems.
 I wish, for instance, that they hadn't chosen to combine Alcott's first two books about the March family into one film.  This results in many small but enjoyable scenes being cut or compressed, and some characters (Laurie's grandfather, for instance) all but ignored.  Moreover, the second book, Good Wives, is more uneven and less enjoyable than Little Women--too sprawling and pat--which drags the second half of the film down.
 Generally the performances are quite good.  I like Winona Ryder's fiestiness and humour as Jo, although I feel that she was physically a little too pretty and delicate.  Claire Danes was a disappointment, although she's usually very reliable.  Her Beth was properly shy, but not soft and capable as she should be. Her retincence seemed almost like a mental handicap.  Trini Alvarado was great as Meg, she really seemed like a product of that era, and Kirsten Dunst had Amy pretty much down pat.  Samantha Mathis, playing the older Amy was all wrong though, too old to be only four years older (she looked older than Ryder) and far, far too stilted.  Gabriel Byrne's professor was the perfect antidote to Christian Bale's Laurie, too.  It was easy to see why Jo would choose The Professor...but then I'd take Gabriel Byrne over just about anyone.
