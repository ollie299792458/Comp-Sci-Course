We open with Jack Stanfield (Harrison Ford), a big bank's software security expert.  He has a wife (Virginia Madsen), two kids, nice house.... you get the idea.  In comes the villian (Paul Bettany) and his band of thugs to try to use Ford to rob the bank.  Pretty simple, huh?  No, not in the least...

The story is a great one in that it is smart, well-paced, and truly suspenseful.  I was on the edge of my seat for nearly the entirety of the film.  Also, you really can't predict where this one is headed at times, which is such a great achievement in a thriller today.

But what really makes this movie is the acting.  Harrison Ford's return to the silver screen is a triumphant one.  He delivers a fantastic performance of an innocent man wronged.  Sound familiar?  Yeah, but who cares?  This is HARRISON FORD, folks!  He's arguably the greatest action hero in cinema history and one of the best actors of all time.  So what if he's already brilliantly played similar parts in "The Fugitive," "Air Force One," and "Clear and Present Danger?"  The point is that they're only similar parts.  Ford's character in Firewall is different from all of those, but different in such subtle ways that he still creates such an inspiring, believable hero that we all can root for.  This is really such a testament to what a great actor Harrison Ford really is.

With every great hero, you need a great villian.  Paul Bettany gives us just that.  He creates a villian with such depth, but yet still so sinister.  I don't think I've ever hated a character in any film more than I hated Bettany's in Firewall.  He's an up and coming star and such a great talent.  We'll definitely be seeing more of him in the near future....

Altogether, Firewall is a fresh, well-crafted film that offers two hours of solid entertainment.  I'm not sure what film some of the critics went to see, but the Firewall I saw was a darn fine film and one I'm looking forward to seeing again.
