Usually it's a bad thing when a movie gets lost in its own minutae and details, but in the case of the third Patlabor, it actually compelled me to rewatch the movie three times -- just to make sure I was pulling together all of the subtleties. This type of fan vigilance wouldn't have happened if it weren't for all the strong virtues of this animation. For one, the pacing and mood of the entire piece is extremely even and poetic especially with Kenji Kawaii supplying a very atmospheric and subdued sountrack. The visuals somehow feel soft and ethereal, meshing perfectly with the controlled temperment of the characters. This alone kept me locked to the screen, even as I was trying to make sense of the clues being followed by the main characters.

The story behind Patlabor 3 is a deceptively shallow one. There's a mysterious beast running loose who is attacking labors. Two detectives, who are introduced as new characters in the movie triology, go about unravelling the gruesome details that all point to a genetic engineering experiment gone wrong. In the hands of a lesser team, this could have been an easy, animated popcorn action flick. Instead, this third Patlabor eschews high octane in favor of a high IQ. Both the script and dialog gambles on the intelligence of its viewers. It takes the angle of surprising realism in its scientific expositions and even affords dignity to the destructive beast and why it was made. I say again... there is not much action in this film. What little action does occur is heart pounding and heart breaking. Instead of a fun yet forgettable fast paced flick, we get something much more cerebral and definitely memorable.
