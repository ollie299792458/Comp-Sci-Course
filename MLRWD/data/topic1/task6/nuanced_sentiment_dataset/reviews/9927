My wife and I love a good romantic comedy. We also like Kevin Costner and Joan Allen. So, when my wife called from the video store and suggested we watch it, I figured it couldn't be too bad. How wrong I was. In 13 years of marriage, my wife and I have never turned off a video that we have rented in the middle of the movie. This movie, friends, is awful. It begins with a funeral and a daughter talking about how happy her mom used to be. Then we jump back in time 3 years. I'm expecting a little bit of that happy-go-lucky mom. Do we get it? Heck no! We get a drunk, angry mom who yells at her kids and sleeps all day. For an hour, I kept thinking that at some point we had to encounter a smidge of either romance or comedy. When neither had blessed us with their presence by an hour and ten minutes, I left the room to go get a novel I'm reading. At 1:15, my wife gave up and said we should switch to another DVD. This is really bad. I mean really really really really bad. Any money or time you spend on this you will regret while on your death-bed. Because I'm never getting that hour back and I'm going to miss it someday. Oh, Joan Allen does  portray a drunk really well. I'll give her that. But being drunk should be a mechanism for going somewhere in a film. It shouldn't be the film. Bad director. Bad director. Go to your room and don't come back until you can recite the definition of "romantic comedy". You lost me at hello.
