I, like the other reviewers, loved this movie in the theater and on video.  It was wonderful and I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD! Alas, I was disappointed greatly in the Director's Expanded Version.  They muted down the Irish music during the love scene, and totally cut out the singing during the captives walk (even though they included that song in the credits).  I didn't really notice any outstanding "expanded scenes."  But I did notice the quip that Hawkeye gave the Major (on the lake with the pistol pointing at him) was cut out.  To me, that quip showed how well Hawkeye could still face adversities and strife.  I would much rather have had a DVD of this movie with behind-the-scenes interviews and deleted scenes (like the love scene between Uncas and Alice under the waterfall).  I would have loved a double love storyline!  It would have made their end much more intense.
Overall, it's still a good movie, but I'm probably going to get rid of my DVD.  I would buy another one if they came out with a better DVD version with more options.
