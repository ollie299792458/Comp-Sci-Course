Having read a few negative reviews about this product I was a bit apprehensive about buying it.  But adding a new 3D movie to my colletion is always very tempting.  I ordered the product and as always Amazon shipped it very very promptly.  I popped it in and to my surprise I actually enjoyed this film.  It gave my subwoofers and buttkicker option in my chair a real workout in the scenes with the cannon fire.  The 3D affects were fantastic.  I recently learned about settings for my 3D TV which were somewhat hidden and having adjusted them I have to say watching 3D is fantastic.  I adjusted the brightness and contrast with a test disc and was able to compensate for the affect of the 3D Glasses.

I have to say story wise I was quite surprised that Orlando Bloom was not one of the Muskateers and was a villian.  I enjoyed the casting of Christoper Waltz as Cardinal Richelieu, he is always a great villian as in Water For Elephants and Inglorious Bastards.  I did like the casting of the Muskateers in the version with Keifer Sutherland and Oliver Platt.

I was happy to see that the door was set for a sequel, which I hope they make.  According to Wikepedia the movie was financially successful.  I think that 3D may catch on as the hardware gets better as I went through two TV's and Three Players before I got to where I was happy and satisfied with the results.

If you are worried about whether you would like to add this to your collection, it is always cheaper to rent it first.  Sometimes I think I should follow my own advice as I have at times added a few stinkers to my collection by purchasing rather than renting first.
