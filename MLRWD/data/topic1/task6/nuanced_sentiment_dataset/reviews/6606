I watched this movie as a rental and never once read the book for that I am sorry.  I liked the movie I just took one star off for the exsesive gore and guts.  
O.K basic monster movie setup with a save the world/comming of age story thrown in.  All of the actors did a great job considering the holes in the script were big enought to drive a truck through.  
I cann finally respect King agian he sold his rights to the movie for one dollar which showed me he didn't care what happened to it.  Givenb what this movie turned out to be I couldn't blame him but maybe if he had gotten more creative control it wouldn't have been so bad.  
What do I mean when I say plot holes?
Who was Duddits exactly?
Why did this war agienst the aliens actually start
what happens in the end, the movie just sort of trialed off.
Do the aliens simply want to destory earth or are they looking for more of a master/slave combination?  
I'm sure these elements were better explianed in the book so I am going to pick myself up a copy so I can rent the movie agian and better understand it.  I suggest you do too.  
Remeber-Gory and depressing not for the faint of heart.
