Each of these terms applies to this film version of Graham Green's classic novel.  The performances are sterling throughout, particular Julianne  Moore's interpretation of Sarah Miles.  As I subsequently read the original  book, it was easy to mentally picture the literary figures as the actors  who portrayed them on film.
The only major deviation from the novel is  that Jordan's Sarah does resume her lovemaking with Bendrix, which does not  happen in the original story.  I found this unfortunate as it blunts the  electrifying point Green was making.  Still, even in this film, there is  reason to doubt that Sarah really intends to go away with Maurice for good.  After the affair is renewed, Sarah dreams about the explosion and  Maurice's apparent death, which sent her in search of God.  When she  awakens, she tells Bendrix that she needs a few days of relaxation before  the arguments begin.  When Bendrix assures her that Henry isn't the arguing  type, she replies "I wasn't talking about Henry."  It's as though  she knows that she cannot have both Maurice and God.
All told, this film  is a wonderful experience.  It can be enjoyed simply on the level of a  moving love story, or it can be taken as a lesson in spirituality.
