Ron Howard really did history justice in this rendition of America's journey into space and the lunar expedition.  Tom Hanks, Ed Harris, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, and Bill Paxton were excellent in their portrayals of their characters.  If you're thinking about seeing this film for the first time, I guarantee it will take you back in time, and literally entrance you.  The moon destined astronauts and the inevitable near death trajedy that occurs hit too close to home and show us raw emotion as well as a willingness to go against the odds and do what it takes to survive.  You will see the interplay of a body of individuals working against the clock, here on earth, to assist the astronauts in space: and you will be struck by their teamwork and unity to accomplish the goal of survival.  This is a story about unity.  About accomplishments.  About strength and survival.  It is a story about family, love and honor.  I have watched this film over a few dozen times, each viewing reminding me of the human struggle factor and what can be accomplished when unity is attained.  The support of family, the knowledge of love, and the faith of honor fully present throughout the film.  Ron Howard makes one mean telling of a team of astronauts who attempted to fly to the moon.
