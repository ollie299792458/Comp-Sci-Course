The movie itself is a dark gem, and others here have covered its merits--I'll say no more about its quality. But what were the folks at Tartan thinking when they literally created, out of very thin air, the subtitles for the Korean-language director's commentary?

The first half of the commentary (an interesting chat between director Park and another K film director, Ryu Seungwan) was reasonably well-translated. But there was no effort to translate the second half of the commentary; the subtitles were almost pure gibberish. While Park and Ryu went on to discuss aspects of dark humor and Bae Duna's acting and alluded to Kitano Takeshi, the subtitles went off in a completely different direction: childish, unenlightening comments on obvious plot points or scene settings. Examples of Tartan's creative writing: "I wanted the viewers to realize that," and "The camera is far away."

Shame on you, Tartan, for thinking nobody would notice and call you on your BS. Not cool to fool your customers, and totally not cool to put made-up words into the mouth of the director, without whom you would have no DVD to sell. It would have been better to have left part of the commentary untranslated if you ran out of time and/or money to do a proper job.

Five stars for the film, minus four stars for Tartan's license to ill.
