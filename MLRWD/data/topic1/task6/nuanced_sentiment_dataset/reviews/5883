As a passionate fan of Murray Lerner's excellent documentary film "Festival", I was excited to hear a recent NPR interview with him regarding his decision to utilize additional footage and outtakes from that film to create another documentary exclusively about the early Bob Dylan. I will say, straight away, I'm not much of a Dylan fan. I've never quite "gotten it" with him. With me, I'm sure it has something to do with my musical ear rebelling at the sound of a consistently out-of tune guitar, grating simplistic harmonica playing, and constricted vocalizations. For me, it was another opportunity to extend my experience with the magic of those early Newport Folk Festival years and my admiration and appreciation of the foresight Lerner had in making that footage. This film does allow that as well as more of the brilliance  of a young Joan Baez. Through this film you can see how "The Times were All A'changin" by the affect Dylan was having on the crowd as his music evolved from 1963 to his "going electric" in 1965. So, while I endured 90 minutes of exclusive Dylan, I did enjoy the experience and opportunity to relive that era.
