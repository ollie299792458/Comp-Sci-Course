In terms of Tarkovsky's 1972 take on this Stanislaw Lem sci/fi novel, his cinematography is achingly beuatiful and well-crafted.  The acting is superb, the production brilliant, given the constraints that the then Soviet government imposed.

And yet, I am left feeling cheated and conned into accepting a view of reality that I find to be close-minded, lacking imagination, settling for the mediocrity of human life.  For - make no mistake - Tarkovsky is a melancholic humanist.  Man doesn't need or want space, or contact with alien intelligence.  Man needs only man and has no business flying off in space or leaving the earth.  It is my understanding that Lem was furious towards Tarkovsky for making this pessimistic, idiosyncratic view of life and reality, which, by its own limits, does not allow any of the speculations that Lem's book demands.

And it is because these reason that I believe Soderbergh's taut rendition to be far better than Tarkovky's.  I know that to say so is almost heretical amongst the professional cinematographic community.  Soderbergh's production emphasises life/death, what-is-the-true-nature-of-life, memory and vindication.  Tarkovsky's film also touches upon the selfsame themes, but more through the distorted lens of his own quite sad personal life history - and, most importantly, in terms of conscience.  This latter factor is absent, and rightly so, from Soderbergh's film, for the most part.

Buy Solaris (2002); rent Solaris (1972)and then decide if it's worth the price.
