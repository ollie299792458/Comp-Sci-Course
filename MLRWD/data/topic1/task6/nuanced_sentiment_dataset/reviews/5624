A man wakes up in a hospital to find that his identity has been erased, his wife looks at him like a stranger, and all his assumptions about his former life may be lies. This is a tense, tightly wound thriller that spins in unanticipated directions,  a smooth, well acted movie in an atmospheric wintry Berlin, featuring spies, assassins, old lovers become strangers, and strangers becoming friends. Is he insane, or is he part of an elaborate plot? Who would create such a plot, and why? Questions abound, but there is little time to think, because a band of talented and motivated killers are on his trail.

Liam Neeson is acceptable as an action hero, although he is getting a bit long in the tooth for such escapades. He still hooks up with younger, beautiful women, because Hollywood has its rules. Feminism hasn't penetrated the old plot device machine. The production is well done, in the manner of films these days. There is nothing new or ground breaking, but this qualifies as an evening's thoughtless entertainment.

There are plot holes galore, but if you don't mind plot holes, you won't mind the film. The central tenet of the movie, that a man forgets most of his former life, but not the recent past, is not the usual result of head trauma. The ability to run around delivering karate chops soon after a cardiac arrest and four day coma is even more unlikely. The resulst of years of biological research residing uniquely on one laptop's hard drive, controllable by the death of one person? If you ask too many questions, you won't enjoy the movie. In this case, it is better to sit back and simply enjoy. Or skip the movies entirely, and read a book.
