The main character Oskar Schell is the most unlikeable spoiled kid in the entire world.
 He's vicious to his mother, and carries an insidious tambourine that ruins every poignant moment.

A disrespectful compression of Foer's well written book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0547735022">Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (Movie Tie-In): A Novel</a> but an even worse rendition than most movies that can't properly render any book.

The wounded characters in the film are vastly underdeveloped and the film becomes just a casting job for Tom Hanks cadre of friends who are normally brilliant performers but aren't given the proper respect of camera time.

Sadly, it just becomes a continuously disappointing compilation like Synedoche but with even more annoying characters.

This film would be absolutely despised if it didn't revolve around the tragedy of 9/11 which combined with the top notch, but ill used cast, is what lures the majority of viewers into the conclusion of contempt for Oskar Schell.

After watching this film, I've stopped keeping mysterious keys AND immediately leave the room anytime I hear tambourines.  I never thought it was possible to hate tambourines until being repeatedly assaulted with the jingling of this film.
