This is not a bad film. In fact it could have been a very good film. But, someone decided to re-capture the essence of "Basic Instinct 1" by making this sequel and casting the "leg crossing" Diva Stone as a much maturer, but still vibrant, Catherine Tramell. She tries hard here to fulfill that role. The whole cast does a good job. But, in retrospect, they wound up trying to duplicate a piece of cinematic history from another director in a differeent century. Considering the sucess rate of sequels, it was darn near impossible.

  View this film and consider an alternate version. Michael Douglas does an opening sequence cameo and drowns. Catherine, suspected of murder, has a fling with the detective, and a flirtatious rouse with her psychiatrist. Obsolved of the murder she returns to the U.S. to become Hillary Clinton's campaign manager. This is no more absurd than what we are being asked to accept in what was scripted for this film.

It could have been a contender if it stood alone and on its own.
