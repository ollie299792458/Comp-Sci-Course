Roger Moore's final performance as James Bond is memorable mostly for the wrong reasons.  Tanya Roberts' poor performance (Which earned her a second consecutive Golden Raspberry Award, AKA Razzie, nomination.) and lack of chemistry with her co-star and a number of action scenes that just did not work so hurt this movie to a serious degree.  It does not come even close to classics like "You Only Live Twice" and "The Spy Who Loved Me."

However there are some elements that do make "A View to a Kill" appealing and quite entertaining.  For example the movie has an excellent pre-credit sequence.  I have watched it many times and enjoy it tremendously.  Duran Duran's excellent theme song is another thing that adds to the movie's entertainment value.  I also enjoyed the sequence right after the opening credits of Q's briefing which sets up Bond's mission.  Such sequences are always enjoyable in all Bond films.  I look forward to them just as much as the action sequences.

Roger Moore has never given a bad performance as Bond and even this movie is no exception in my opinion.  He certainly helps carry the movie and makes it watchable.  I must not forget Christopher Walken who is quite good as villain Max Zorin (A role rejected by both David Bowie and Sting.).  He is quite menacing as the mad industrialist hell bent on destroying Silicon Valley.  He is terrific here.  Almost as good as Christopher Lee ("The Man With the Golden Gun".) and the late Curt Jurgens ("The Spy Who Loved Me".) who rank among the great Bond villains.

In the end, it's easy to see why this movie is so reviled by critics and fans alike.  However it does have it's moments that make it worth seeing.
