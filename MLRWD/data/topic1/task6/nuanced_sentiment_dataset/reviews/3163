Only the powerful perfomance of Denzel saves this movie from being another action-thriller with the same archplot that ends up in the same hero-villian chase which has become a redundent characteristic of most hollywood movies. What makes me sad is that a lot of these movies have great casts and plots, except for those finalizing sequences when the plot comes to resolution. This robs many of these movies of their potential to suprise and thrill viewers. Does a lot of people really enjoy predictability? I mean these filmakers would not be doing this if it was not working for them at the box office. Does this mean that the majority of people are so shallow that they would not demand more creativity and innovativeness from what they are fed entertainment wise?

It grieves me think that "Training Day", as well as so many other movies, could have been phenomenal had it had a more original ending. The way some of the stories (that get subjected to this malaise of creativity) are so good at the begining makes me think that the writers have to "doctor" their stories to fit in the archplot paradigm. Or maybe they just get lazy. Either way this is a diservice to the industry.
