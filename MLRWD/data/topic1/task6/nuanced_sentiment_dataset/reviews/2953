What a mess they have made of the 007 franchise.  I grew up with Bond in the late 60's and 70's with the Sean Connery and Roger Moore versions of the secret agent and like many fans of this series take comfort in the formula that made it great.  With Quantum of Solace (as in Casino Royale) I'm presented with something claiming to be a James Bond movie that is all but unrecognizable as one.  The big opening scene featuring a Bond getaway is just another car chase.  And the car, yes he's got an Aston Martin but it's simply a fast car, no gadgets, nothing special and the director seems determined to wreck it as quickly as possible.  Speaking of gadgets, "Q" is dead and our current J.B. is left to fend for himself just like any other Joe.  The iconic James Bond theme is relegated to the closing credits along with the trademark view through the gun barrel sequence that launched the previous films.  Love Dame Judi Dench in other roles, hate her as "M".  Daniel Craig's 007 is a charmless, humorless murdering robot; no snappy double entendres from this super spy.  Someone must have felt a little guilt after the last movie so they've tossed in a couple of nods to the past; a bartender recites the Bond martini recipe and Craig uses a Walter PPK in a few scenes.  You have the homage to Goldfinger, but with oil this time around substituting for gold.  I found the plot difficult, if not impossible to follow, as if the screenplay was written by a collection of drunks on a weekend bender.  Like all the past movies at the end of the credits it says "James Bond will return"; if only he would.
