If this movie would have been done correctly it should have just revolved around Wolverine, Victor Creed and Stryker. Thats really it. The writers however decided to try to turn this into yet another X-Men movie by bringing in way too many additional characters and trying to form a team. Why is Gambit in this movie? I understand that he is a favorite of many who love the X-Men comics but he feels so forced in this movie. It was like the writers said "We need to get Gambit into an X-Men movie or the fans will hate us. So lets put him in this movie where he doesn't belong at all!" And then there is the elephant in the room Deadpool. There is so much outrage from the fans of Deadpool being completely unlike how he is in the comics. In the movie, they remove his mouth. WTF? He is supposed to be 'the merc with a mouth'. And then they make swords come out of this arms like Baraka from Mortal Kombat. Then there are the visuals. They clearly ran out of time to finish many of the CGI effects and this movie shows more than any other that I can think of. The scene where Wolverine is in the mirror, his claws looked like they were drawn in with a pencil. It looks so bad its actually hilarious. Then they cast Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed (Sabretooth). Now, I have no problem with Liev, I actually think he is a really good actor. But Sabretooth is supposed to be huge. Quite a bit taller than Wolverine at least, and he looks tiny. Hugh Jackman does everything he can to save this movie. He really has his character of Wolverine nailed down and I like it, and many of the fans like it. But this movie could have been avoided entirely. In X2: X-Men United they have flashback sequences to tell the audience of how Wolverine got his adamantium skeleton and those few sequences are better than this entire movie. So this movie ranks in my opinion the worst X-Men movie tied with X-Men 3 The Last Stand. They are both so horrible I don't know which one to pick as worse.
