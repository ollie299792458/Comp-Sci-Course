An utterly horrendous adaptation of one of my all-time favorite novels.  It completely misses the point by focusing exclusively on the murder mystery (and it doesn't even do that well), when in fact that was simply Eco's device for framing a post-modern reflection on the downfall of the seemingly impregnible edifice ("aedificium") of human reason.  The film makes the monks seem like dull-witted cretins, when in the novel (and as a matter of historical fact) they were the scholars and intelligentia of the time.  The protagonist, William of Baskerville (played by Sean Connery), is portrayed as an infallible sleuth who gets everything right, whereas the novel emphasizes that William, despite his razor sharp acumen, each time only stumbles upon the right answers by accident, i.e., irrationally.  The single sex scene is done to excess, and the bitter end of Adso's romance is completely altered, undoing the sense of tragedy at the hands of a fanatical devotion to "truth".  The importance of "the forbidden book" is never adequately conveyed, leaving the viewer with no sense of why people were murdered for it in the first place.  I can go on and on, but my frustration at this movie should be clear enough.  1 star because I have to, a second for the scenery, which was quite good and captured my own sense of what the monastery and its environs would have looked like.
