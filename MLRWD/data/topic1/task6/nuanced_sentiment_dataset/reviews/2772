Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of the Blood Books. This series did not live up to my expectations. It was filmed and written in a cheesy way. Not to mention I hated the fact that they chose to totally drop the Tony character, which I can only view as a way to play up the love triangle between Vikki, Henry and Mike. God forbid they have a gay character mudding up the water; how could Henry possiblly be interested in this guy when there's this beautiful woman hanging around. We've read the books we know Henry's bisexual, did the producers think that the larger population couldn't handle it too. How short-sighted. And what was with the Coreen character. She was just a minor character in the first book and then forgotten. Not to mention the actress played her in such an annoying way. The producers just beefed-up her character as a replacement for Tony; I mean she basically ended up doing his job. Don't misunderstand me, I'm not a purist, usually I'll roll with the punches when a book I love makes the jump from paper to screen, but come on there is no reasonable rational explanation for such unnecessary changes to the plot.
