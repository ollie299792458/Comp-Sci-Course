This isn't exactly your average buckets-o-gore, slow-moving (the zombies, not the movie) zombie film, but it's close enough and almost just as good. I say almost, because quite frankly, there could have been a little more gore...it wouldn't have hurt. The plot is the kicker. During World War II, the [Germans] experimented with making the perfect soldiers. They began their research from ancient stories of unstoppable warriors whose power comes from the ground...these soldiers are neither alive or dead, but they are rotting and can live under water all the live-long day, so I'm leaning more towards dead.
A group of tourists cruising the islands run aground a deserted island after going into what might be the Bermuda Triangle or a similar anomally and hitting the [German's] old sunken ship. They find an old hotel, inhabitted only by Peter Cushing, playing a not-quite-ex-[German]commander. The hijinks ensue as the zombies begin attacking the tourists. This is campy 70's horror at its best. Check it out.
