If there was ever a case of misleading packaging, this would be it.

Not only is the outside of the packaging deliberately made to look like "The Secret" but even the imagery used for the background of the speakers looks very much like the bestseller's. This film markets itself as a continuation or expansion of the teachings of "The Secret" by Rhonda Byrne. But make no mistake, it is most certainly not.

One of its first messages is that one is naive for believing that the "Laws of Attraction" are truly as simple as they are. Then it begins to press the message that religion is what will truly bring one happiness.

I have the audiobook for "The Secret" and love it. It is an uplifting book that gives a message hope and optimism, regardless of religion or faith. I personally found it when I needed it most. I found it exciting to think that there would be a movie expanding on the concepts in the book and was sorely disappointed. I think it is disheartening that people would take advantage of such a positive thing that is currently successful, and distort it to force their options on others.
