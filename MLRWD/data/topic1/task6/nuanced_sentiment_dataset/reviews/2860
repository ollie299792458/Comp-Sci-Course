I had high hopes for this movie, and from the moment it started I really wanted to like it. In fact the opening 5 minutes or so are pretty good, and I especially like the scene in which a man commits suicide by jumping from a bridge. But it was all downhill from then on - and that's before we even get to see the monster.

The movie is essentially a Godzilla remake of sorts, with the same basic premise of a monster created via mutation. There's not much in terms of originality, certainly not on a par with Jaws, or even the Godzilla remake for that matter.

It's just not a good monster movie: It's not scary, the monster is not believable, the CGI and animatronic effects are below par (sometimes laughable even - as in the scene in which the monster flops down on a car (looks like a rubber toy), the script is weak, and the actors are uninspired.

My recommendation would be to rent before buying. I wish I had. Just as a point of reference, I consider the monster movies of the late '70s- early '80s to be among the finest produced: Alien, Jaws, The Thing, American Werewolf in London, The Howling. These movie sets standards for technical  excellence and essentially either created their own genres or progressed existing ones.

Sadly The Host accomplishes neither.
