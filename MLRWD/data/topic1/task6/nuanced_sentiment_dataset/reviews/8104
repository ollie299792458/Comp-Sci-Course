Wow. First off, i would like to say that I live in the city of Fargo, ND and have almost my entire life. We are not hicks here, we dont talk with extreme norweigan accents, (ok, maybe some of the really old people do) and generally, do not murder people in the snow. What most people don't realize is that Fargo has over 100,000 people in it, not including the suburbs. We are a city just like any other city with malls, movie theatres, clubs, you name it. This movie has portrayed Fargo in a way that no one here really likes. No doubt, it has made Fargo pretty popluar, but you wouldnt believe how many times i've been on vacation and heard.."You're from Fargo? Like the movie?" Im almost positive it is in the thousands. This movie actually wasn't even filmed in Fargo. It was filmed in Brainard, Minn. an hour or 2 from here. I think the only think accurate about this movie is the weather. It does tend to get down to -30 (not kidding) during the winter and stays that way for months on end. I just thought everyone would like to know the truth behind this movie, and maybe the next time i watch Joe Dirt, i won't stereotype the people in the south as trailer trash hicks.
