Wow, I just bought this the other day and was appalled at how bad it was. This film along with the dire Batman and Robin shows why a new franchise had to be made.

First, Kilmer is rubbish as Batman, and even worse at playing Bruce Wayne. He's wooden, stiff, boring, just utter rubbish. Then Two Face. I dont think this is Tommy Lee Jones fault, but Two Face was a large disappointment. Totally disregarding his back story, his complex charecter and just sanity itself, Two Face just becomes a joke. He just goes on 'Joker' overload, becoming more insane and ridiculous and hammed than Jack Nicholsons Joker himself. Jim Carrey as usual plays Jim Carrey. The Riddler was also a massive disappointment, just looking like a deranged clown obsessed with his idol Bruce Wayne, Carrey totally ruins the Riddler, hes never scary, menacing  or even intelligent at any moment during the film, and the way they treat him at the end is just terrible. I mean melting face??? I am Batman??? Robin is just an annoying, arrogant little turd, Nicole Kidman is mediocre, Alfred is nothing special. The plotholes are gaping, whats left of the plot is unbelievable rubbish.

This turgid piece of "film-making" is nearly on a par with Batman and Robin which is probably the worst film ever, and I was left cold by Joel Schumacher pissing all over Burtons Gotham, and ruining a perfectly good franchise with plotholes, a turgid script, badly thought out charecters, rubbish actors, hammy lines, bad CG, poor action, an appalling plot and bad directing.

This film is awful, dont buy it, it would be better to buy something with a bit more sense and enjoyment, like Scooby Doo 2.
