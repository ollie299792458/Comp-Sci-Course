After watching Mission to Mars, I would have liked to write a glowing review, as it looked pretty decent from the preview, but alas, I cannot.  While this film might be one of the most impressive science fiction films visually, the derivative plot elements can't save it from the land of the merely mediocre.  Director Brian De Palma's trademark slow pans are here, easing the camera over some wonderful scenery of the red planet and futuristic spacecraft.  Unfortunately for the background, there's a story going on in the front, with ideas borrowed heavily from fare like 2001, The Abyss, and Sphere.  Most of the actors do a good job with the material they're given, and it's certainly a great list of talent:  Tim Robbins, Don Cheadle, Gary Sinise.

I won't complain about the slow plotting, because frankly I didn't think it was that slow.  In fact, I thought that a lot of the slow buildups added favorably to the "drifting through space" feel and increased the terror and suspense built into the story.

Overall, I quite enjoyed Mission to Mars.  Flawed, yes...but not tragically.
