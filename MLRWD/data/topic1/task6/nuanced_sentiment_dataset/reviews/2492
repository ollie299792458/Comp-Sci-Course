I hate to be the only one to say it. but this movie sucked.  It's very strange to me how the premise being about a bluesmen going to Tuva to connect with throat singers was abouts something else entirerly which was not inspirational.  This movie is really about the stupidest americans going to another culture and being disrespectful.

The main character paul pena is the biggest complaining ass.  He manages to stay pretty drunk throughout his whole time in Tuva, and in one instance hands an unsuspecting Tuvan a joint.  Not that i wouldnt have enjoyed doing that as well.  But its hard to take since Paul also complains of needing medication and being depressed.  But paul isnt the only ass of this documentary.  He also has help from his Friends of Tuva and the filmers.  if there is any value in watchings this piece of @#*# its in what not to do when you visit other countries.  Seriously, one of his friends even got into a fight and almost died there.  From that character's earlier appearences in the film, i would have to say that he  would have deserved it.  The only thing going for this movie is photage of acual Tuvan's singing.  Im so sorry they had to meet this guy.  If you do decide to get this don't forget to watch the interview with the directors.  Thats definately the best part.  Ive met some pretty ridiculous film students before, but this two are like charactures of them.  if you are interested in seeing other movies where americans act retarded in other countries i would recommend seeing The Journey Of Man.
