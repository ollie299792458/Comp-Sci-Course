I never have or ever wanted to review films but this film made me change my mind! The Thin Red Line is definitely on my list of top 5 all time great films alongside Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, Braveheart and Legends of the Fall).  Having read all of the other reviewers, I was convinced that DOH is a great film and was dying to see it.  So I ordered the DVD.  The day I got the DVD I went home with my girlfriend, got the ice cream and sat in front of my widescreen TV for another Malick cinematic treat.  What followed was quite painful to watch.  Other than the "every-five-minute" beautiful shot of the landscape etc, nothing made us watch or listen with the same enthusiasm or interest as with TTRL. Something was REALLY lacking.  I always watch a film and expect the film to entertain me in every way - story, acting, cinematography, music and direction - for me, DOH lacked in every department. I honestly don't understand the other reviewers' comments. When I find a good film, I normally watch it over and over again every couple of months just to appreciate and remember how good films can be. But this DVD will be sitting on my shelf and I hope I run into someone who wants to buy it as I certainly will not be watching it again!! If you desperately WANT to like/enjoy a film, I guess then you can TRY and convince yourself that you enjoyed it and tell others that its a good film.  People normally do this because its their favourite director/actor leading the film.  But this is not how I watch films. Malick did a great job with TTRL and it was an unforgettable experience.  Unfortunately, DOH is easily forgettable - it is, quite simply, a bad film.  Don't believe the hype .... like I did!!!
