I want to give this movie 2.5 stars but I will round up to three. It finished up ooookay but it opened with quite possibly the worst 20 minutes in cinematic history.

This story about a boy and a horse opens with 20 minutes of extended celebrations of literally the smallest victories imaginable.

Horse comes into the world.

Boy has an apple and the possibility exists that the horse MAY take a bite of the apple.

You can do it, War Horse!

But this is no one-trick pony. Bad things also happen to the horse.

The horse might be sold.

Ten minutes in we suspect it, but by the one hour mark, we are utterly convinced of the thesis Spielberg set out to prove with this film: This boy is gay for his horse.

There are no two ways about it. Spielberg sets out, argues and concludes his case in one of the most convincing films of all time. This film leaves no doubt whatsoever in the viewer's mind that, this kid loves horses.  Big time.  You will walk away with the absolute knowledge that this kid loves horses.  Loves looking at them, loves crying about them, loves walking beside them, hugging them, feeding them fruit, thinking about them, dreaming about them, looking at pictures of them, putting collars on them, telling his friends about them, writing letters about them...

War Horse.

Also, the horse goes on some adventures, some more interesting than others.

I recommend this if you have a giant picture of a horse on your bedroom ceiling. Otherwise, you can probably take or leave it.
