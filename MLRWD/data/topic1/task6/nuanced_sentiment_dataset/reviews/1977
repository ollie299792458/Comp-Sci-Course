I agree with P. White's review that this is an excellent series but has one serious flaw. I had read his review before ordering the Blu-Ray version and hoped that I wouldn't feel the same way. I don't agree with his negative comments about the soundtrack but I am in compete agreement about the dirt in the archive video scenes. There is a large blob of dirt that is almost precisely in the middle of the picture for a very large percentage of the archive footage. As he says this was not in the original footage but obviously added during the transfer process. Since this series is about one of the most significant periods in U.S. history, and includes interviews with the real participants, who won't be with us much longer, the problem is a great shame and deserves to be corrected. Discovery please consider fixing this flaw and reissuing this. I am willing to buy it again as part of a collectors edition, with additional material, if you will fix this. I was exicited to see restored footage on Blu-Ray but this dirt really detracts from the experience.
