I think the fact that so many people gave this movie poor reviews because it moves too slow are really, really missing the point.
The movie was about two guys that have spent their life "barrelling down the highway".  They don't ever stop moving or look to see the desert that is passing by their car.  Once they leave their car and begin the hike, they cannot stop, even after they are lost and moving aimlessly.  At a campfire, their only topic of a conversation is a video game that simulates reality.  It takes being lost in the desert, becoming severely dehydrated and exhausted to finally force them to stop and experience the world around them for the first time.
At the same time, the movie takes the viewer through this awakening. We actually experience scenes in which nothing occurs except life - a guy looking around him at the rocks, two figures shuffling through the early-dawn desert.  Instead of a movie being a vehicle for a constant stream of entertainment, as virtually every movie made today is, it's something rare in that it celebrates the absence of action, the destination instead of the trip.  It's pretty neat that this movie consists of maybe two sheets of dialogue and two guys lost in the desert, and you can discuss or ponder its meaning for days afterward.
So, if you want to see a standard hollywood movie that entertains in the traditional format, then this isn't it.  If you are in the mood for something different and rare, then I think this movie is very rewarding if you give it the attention it deserves.  I hope this didn't come off as sounding like I want to be a high-brow critic - I don't mean this at all as I'm definitely not.  I just really thought that this movie was something special that deserves a second look.
