i have this movie on japanese laserdisc.

this is my favourite studio ghibli film. i lived on the outskirts of a japanese city while i was a child, during the ten years we lived there the neighborhood changed from 3/4 fields of crops to 3/4 private homes, this film resonates with me in way that Miyazaki's more fantastic ecology films don't, tho Totoro has many familiar sights in it.

like the previous reviewer i thought this film would run afoul of the MPAA rating system and american puritanical tradition. i'll be blunt. anyone who has seen a ceramic tanuki knows they have huge testicles.  in the film they use them as weapons, literally.

in one scene the old tanuki teaching the younger ones the art of transforming, informs them the mat that they are all sitting on is his transformed testicles.  in another a tanuki swings his scrotum with his hands like a sack of bowling balls in a fight.

it's as sexual as the bath scene in Totoro(not at all), still i never thoght this movie could get a PG in america.

not sure but, i believe the japanese tried to enter this film in the best foreign film catagory in the oscars. it deserved it as much as the Incredibles did.
