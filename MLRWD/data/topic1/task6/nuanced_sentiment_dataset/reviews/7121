The good:Weaver played the part of Dr.Helen Hudson well,and Holly Hunter followed close behind-though her character,mannerisms,and even the accent she used(unless this is her normal voice;this is the first time I've seen her on screen)was lifted from Agent Starling's of "The Silence of The Lambs". The script is decent though it contributes nothing new to this well trodden genre.  The bad:The cinematagraphy is bad,making the film look like any generic contender in the "serial killer on the loose,let's find him before he stikes again" sweepstakes(which in fact,it would be,were it not for the cast).  The killing of the agent at the station by some innocuous second stringer or other also made for cheap melodrama;I didn't feel like it belonged in the film as a whole.  William McNamara is (barely) adequate playing the second killer,led by the nose by jailed psychopath Daryl Lee Cullum(now THAT sounds like a name a serial killer would have).  Cullum is played well by Harry Connick Jr.,even he occasionaly pushes his hayseed Hannibal Lecter act a bit far.
FINAL THOUGHT:Good for a rainy day.Not excellent,but well paced,with wonderful leads,and some jumps.A fine sense of 'symmetry' as well,on part of the (otherwise boring)William McNamara,who's acting undermime's the script's repeated attempts to make him creepy,and disturbing.Even when he goes after Helen he reminded me of an extra on a sitcom.
