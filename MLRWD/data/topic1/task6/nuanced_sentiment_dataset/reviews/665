This film got hyped because it portrayed a subclique that gets little mainstream play: cool Asians nerds.  It's a pretty ripe  concept to riff off of, but BLT was a flawed effort and can't compare to other, earlier movies that explore the same topic, such as Over the Edge and Kids.
Visually, BLT is a hodge podge of styles, with shots ripped off left and right, mainly from Scorcese's Goodfellas but also from a host of other filmschool staples.  The cinematography was about what one would expect from a first time director's low budget debut- nondescript and slighty grey, which is a little surprising since it always seems so easy to get a hot, glossy look for anything shot in Southern California.  That might've been the aesthitic the cinematographer was aiming for, but it made for a boring look, especially for an MTV film about disaffected Cali youth.
Storywise, the movie was verrrrrrrry slooooooooow.  And not that shocking.  And pretty implausible.  I mean, c'mon- their life of crime went from running petty credit card scams and a high school cheatsheet ring to dealing in guns and coke?  And their motive for all this secret bad behavior: because they can get away with it and still get into the Ivy League.  Uh, yeah sure, I'll buy that.  And it all seems even more silly because the actors appear to be at least six years older than any high school student anywhere would ever look.
BLT isn't exactly a total waste of time.  Despite the increasingly unbelievable plotline, the lead actor's performance is very good and there is a fair amount of chemistry going on in the scenes he has with the cheerleader porno girl.  But all in all, it makes you feel sorry for these kids of today- they're being cheated in the "disaffected youth films" category.
