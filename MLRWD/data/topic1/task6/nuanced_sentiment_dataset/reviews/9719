Some have commented that this is the best Lucia on DVD. If it is, are we hard up. Sutherland is beyond petrified, she is at the embalmed stage. This is just an eerie echo of her famed

Lucia from 25 years earlier. Some parts are transposed so that

she can "appear" to sing the familiar high options.

Pushing part of the mad scene downward puts sections of it in the area were Sutherland is forced to growl to get through them.

In all fairness, much of Sutherland's technique is still intact and she still is able to do the amazing feat of darting around the stage during the flute cadenza of the mad scene. It's just too bad there isn't a video documentation from her prime.

The production is typical Met musty routine, with no real attempt to bring any drama at all to the performance.

Bonynge leads the performance in a very careful way to help Dame Joan avoid as many vocal risks as possible.

Yes, the ageless Kraus sings Edgardo and he does it well. But at this point point his voice had taken on a somewhat wooden quality.

Both lead singers are approaching their 60th birthdays and it is impossible to avoid the march of time.

I would recommend getting the Devia Lucia on DVD or the Opera Lyon Lucie DVD
