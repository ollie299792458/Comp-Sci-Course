Simply put: Do not buy this or any other bootleg set. Buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JAHPMG">BONANZA: The Official First Season</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044RFTDI">BONANZA: The Official Second Season vol. 1</a> released by CBS Paramount; these are the ONLY seasonal sets licensed by Bonanza Ventures and NBC Universal. You'll get all the episodes in this set plus more episodes from the first two seasons, plus great extras including photo galleries, trailers, interviews with creator-producer David Dortort and more. And all the episodes are un-cut, have the original music (including the classic theme song) and look great because they are re-mastered from the original film elements. BONANZA -- the Real Deal -- Rocks! And if you still want official BONANZA for less money -- avoid the bootlegs!  -- and get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009NH9L">The Best of BONANZA</a> put out by Artisan several years ago. No extras, but the episodes have great picture and sound quality and are complete and uncut.
