with the ghosts of A.I. nipping at his heels, spielberg dazzles with a remarkably successful venture back into sci-fi
taking its basis from the philip k. dick short story of the same name, minority report transports and transfixes the viewer into the future, to the year 2054, where pre-crime has been functioning successfully in washington dc for the past six years.
precrime has made murder a thing of the past, and detective anderton, is one of the best pre-crime detectives there has been.
as the movie opens, we are brought into anderton's world, where the pre-cogs (precognitives, with future sight) see murders before they happen.  
but what happens when the system fingers one of its own...
anderton is now faced with seeing a murder committed by himself...of someone he has never even met.  we follow him on his crusade to find out if the system can fail...
what if the pre-cogs disagree...what if they are wrong...
is he really to kill someone he does not know?
do we have free choice as we think, or are we fated to follow through regardless of our efforts to the contrary.
this is the meat of the movie, and pkd at his best, using sci-fi as a venue to voice a social question regarding free will.
the movie is a wonderful contrast of futuristic landscapes, with georgetown homes, high tech weaponry, and old fashioned handguns.
spielberg uses the camera to change perspective, and does some rather humorous things with product placement (similar as well to neal stephensons the diamond age), showing how marketing can be taken in by the glimmers of technology.
a well directed movie, and a convincingly acted one as well.
