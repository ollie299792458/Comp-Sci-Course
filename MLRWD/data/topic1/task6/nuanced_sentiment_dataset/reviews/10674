(I had an advanced view of this dvd)  Let me start off by saying - I went into seeing this movie with a big head...I thought the movie was going to be one of the best Shakespearean adaptations from play to movie ever  because I had read the play before and love it.  It falls a little because  of the length - but Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange make up for the 162  minutes of movie.  Victorious general, Titus Andronicus, returns to Rome  with hostages: Tamora queen of the Goths and her sons. He orders the eldest  hewn to appease the Roman dead. He declines the proffered emperor's crown,  nominating Saturninus, the last ruler's venal elder son. Saturninus, to  spite his brother Bassianus, demands the hand of Lavinia, Titus's daughter.  When Bassianus, Lavinia, and Titus's sons flee in protest, Titus stands  against them and slays one of his own. Saturninus marries the honey-tongued  Tamora, who vows vengeance against Titus. The ensuing maelstrom serves up  tongues, hands, rape, adultery, racism, and Goth-meat pie. There's irony in  which two sons survive.  The dvd is packed with many features including  two commentaries.  They are both insightful and informative.  Their is a  nice making of documentary that goes some what indepth in the movie but  it's no Fight Club.  Round of is the theatrical trailer.  In the  end..the movie(to me) was great! I would rather have extras on the dvd than  none at all - so that was a plus.  Bloody and vulgar, -- See it with a  clear head..you won't like it if you don't like to hear about racism, rape,  etc. etc.
