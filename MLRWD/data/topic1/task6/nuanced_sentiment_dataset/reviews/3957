Gong Li is one of my favorite actresses...For this reason, and for this reason only, I give this film three stars. Otherwise, this film is a disaster.
1) Half-Baked story: Is this a love story with a marshal art twist or is this film a marshal art story with a love twist? The problem is this film cannot define itself.
2) Too much of everything: Visual effects, special effects, sounds, music (cheesy, sentimental, too dramatic), consume design etc....every single one of them is overemphasized....it's like having to eat piece after piece of chocolate cake after a full-course of Americanized Chinese food. It's too much! It's like having to read emails in all capital letters. Every single one of them (effects) is shouting...watch me! Listen to me!
3) Bad voice-over: I don't know if mine was a standard version....not subtitled... Whoever did the voice-over needs to enter a drama school and take Acting 101. Esp. the voice of the third son (His acting was awful, too) was poor.
Overall, you should watch this film after drinking Red Bull (or something like that). Otherwise, you will be mentally exhausted afterwards.
