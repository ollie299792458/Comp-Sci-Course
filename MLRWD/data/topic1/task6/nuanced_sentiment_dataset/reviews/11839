This was a pretty good movie except for the constant (and in many cases DELIBERATE) use of the F* word.

Matthew McConaughey's character (John Anthony) goes through a success-failure-success-failure cycle and you have to wait until the very end of the movie to see what part of the cycle he ends on.  As a morality play, the movie is pretty well written and has a few interesting twists.

Al Pacino's character is fairly intense and Pacino does a superb job bringing this character to life.  Some of his monologues are well written and brilliantly delivered.

This is definitely not a movie you take your teenage kids to see -- and certainly not pre-teens either.  Aside from the language, there is one sex scene with nudity and one scene of violence that (IMHO) ends up going a little too far.  If the movie didn't have the language and the one violent scene (trust me, you'll know it when you see it), I would rate it 4 stars.

If you can get past all that, it's a pretty good return on your movie dollar.
