I loved this movie.  OK, so it's not one of the best ones out there, but c'mon, it is exciting.  I've read so many reviews that give this movie such poor ratings; the reviewer thinks the acting is bad, or it's not realistic, or just plain humourous.. Yeah, the acting isn't the best, but isn't K2 REALLY the star in all this?  Do you seriously watch this expecting "superb" acting talent? If you go into it expecting Emmy winning performances, honey, I've got a list of movies you SHOULD be watching, instead. As for the realism, HELLO! This is HOLLYWOOD! You want realism?  Go watch the National Geographic Channel, or the Travel Channel.  (...) But movies are meant to be fun, and silly and exciting and allow you to get lost in the absurdity for the moment.  Isn't that why we go to movies in the first place? I don't know about you, but I get enough "realism" in my own life.

This is a fun, silly, exciting movie with great effects and a pretty good plot line.  Go, enjoy the movie and get lost in the whirlwind, err, "avalanche" of it all, and just chill out.
