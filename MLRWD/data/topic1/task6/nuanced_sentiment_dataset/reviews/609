Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather Part III" is an incredible standard in mottion pictures. Out of probably the three greatest sequels ever made in one probably the greatest trilogy ever made, and when I say one of the greatest I can not exclude Indiana Jones, because I am the biggest Spielberg fan in the world. "The Godfather Part III" is not the best in the series, but it's probably the most intriuging. Given the simple story line, with some great novel twists, "Part III" is my favorite. I loved this movie ever since the first frame started to roll. The incredible opening of the abandoned compund in Tahoe, to the ceremony, to the party. The dance that Don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) does with his daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola), is incredible. The patriarch of the family is now in his sixties, his relationship with Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), has gone to hell in a handbasket, as so apparent in "Part II". Michael is trying very hard to go straight, to have a legitimate life. It's going as he has planned, but when Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), the bastard son of Sonny (James Cann), who met his fiery end in "Part I", has come to his Uncle, trying to get rid of the bad blood between him and rival gangster, Joey Zasa (Joe Mantagna), who now controls the family business in New York. Michael and business advisor, BJ Harrison (George Hamilton), want part in a conglomerate called, International Immobiliare. The futrue of the legitimate business deals rests in this company, which rests in the hands of a dying Pope. After 80 minutes, the clan moves out to Sicily to see Michael's son, Anthony, perform in an opera, "Cavilleria Rusticana." The climax of the film is very exciting, and the ending is very sad. If you are a person who gets overlly envolved in films, you may need kleenex for the very ironic ending to the Corleone Empire.
