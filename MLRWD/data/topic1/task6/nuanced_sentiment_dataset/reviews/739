Tara Road is definitely a movie I would have nott seen in the theatre or rented at the video store.  So I was pleasently surprise at how much I enjoyed this film.  It is one of those films I would describe as an "enjoyable little film".

The film does not try to be something it is not; it is a story about two women at a crossroads in their separate lives and how friendship can move them past tragedies in their lives.

The two lead characters are interesting in that you have an American lady who has closed herself off from everyone who wants to help her after the death of her son.  We also have an Irish lady (Ria) who after finding out about her husband's infidelity looks to friends and family for support, only to find they blame her for his affairs (or at least that is how she feels). By switching lives for short period of time they both hope they can find the answers they need.

The story is entertaining and I enjoyed the performances by most of the supporting actors.  Unfortunately I did not enjoy the performances of the leading actors; Andie McDowell and Olivia Williams.  Andie's performance just did not seem to fit this character.  There were moments when her character would look into the camera and you would expect her to convey the emotion of the moment, but it was not there.

I think part of the problem may have been with the directing or the storytelling.  Their seemed to be pieces missing, especially in Ria's life in America.  I have not read the book so if there are parts of the story missing they were lost in the movie.

Neither of the lead women seemed to capture the tragedies that happened in their lives, they just seemed odd.  I see this movie mainly appealing to those who like romantic comedies.  If you do, or you are an Andie McDowell fan, then you will enjoy this movie.
