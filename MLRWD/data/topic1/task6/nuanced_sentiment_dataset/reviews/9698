Okay, after watching Fort Apache and enjoying it I had to continue with the second in the "cavalry trilogy" by director John Ford.  I can not believe that I went and bought another fifties western with again John Wayne as the star.  But I did, and I think I am becoming addicted to these slow paced movies with "heroes" who have strong character and strong morals.
  These horse soldiers of the past led a lonely and dangerous life and they are no longer portrayed in the movies of today.  The location where the movie was filmed is a lonely place but has a stark beauty that comes across in the movie and grabs you.  Especially the scenes of the clouds and sky.  Reminded me of the saying: "Big Sky Country".
  Again the Native Americans were portrayed "fifties style" compared to a modern movie such as "Dances With Wolves", however, for the time frame of the movie the portrayal was not bad.
  I enjoyed the movie and John Wayne's portrayal as an aging cavalry officer who is due to retire but enjoys the life he leads very much, and I found his character very believable.  The story is simply told, but there is a story.  This is sometimes lacking in today's movies.
  The music and the songs added to the pleasure of the movie.  You should give this movie a chance, although more simplistic than the movies of today it is very enjoyable.  It is a true classic!
