As a 12 year-old boy seeing the original Tron, I was hooked.  When I bought the 20th anniversary DVD I was taken back on a sentimental journey reminding me of those times when a movie came along that showed you new things you'd never seen before.  Tron was one such movie.  I worried how Tron Legacy would look, if it would be just like every other new sci-fi movie, and if it could stand out uniquely as much as the original did.  Tron Legacy is stunning visually, and even more impressive for me is the story.  What a great way to connect the two, and carry on the story.  I'm amazed by people who think it as shallow, or without soul.  This movie is rich, and has great depth.  Those who can't see that, don't fully grasp the story.  Tron was all Steven Lisberger, and although Tron Legacy has creative input and direction from additional people, Steven's hand is evident throughout.  I feared they might not be able to pull it off, but not only did they pull it off, they did it convincingly.  The Tron franchise still stands alone, not that it's the best movie ever made (how can that even be determined?, but Tron Legacy helps to cement the story as one of the most unique.  Too many movies follow a formula where you can figure out what is going to happen.  Tron does not.  Who could have guessed what Clu becomes, or that Tron changes allegiance?  The nuggets classic Tron fans are thrown throughout the movie are a real treat: Dumont's garage, Journey on the juke box, Dillinger's son, and so on. I loved the young Flynn and old Flynn.  The did it flawlessly.
