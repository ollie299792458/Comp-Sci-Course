I liked the action and the acting. Enjoy the wilderness, with some great pictures, but don't think to much about the details:

Nobody could just go on climbing, pulling on ropes etc after the heavy cart came...

I don't think an adventurer would just step over the cliff, when he could grab an - uncocked - pistol in front of his nose first;

they could never dig that great snow-hole in time with what they had and would not have digged it totally out in the open blast of the storm - there were rocks in the background - and so fast that the rucksack had hardly snow on and around it, after they finished digging;

the guide had ample time to plan to escape, why should she wait until they are back near civilization;

can the FBI go shooting around with guns in Canada, under the eyes of the Canadian police?

why should a mother covering her child, go over to the killer and leave her child? .....)

As I said - enjoy the action, just don't think to much.
