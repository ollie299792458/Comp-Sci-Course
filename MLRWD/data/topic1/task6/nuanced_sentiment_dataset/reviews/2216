I picked this up at the video store having no idea what to expect. What I got was exactly that. While in the beginning scenes it is funny, this is a very, very strange film although it is fairly generic at it's heart. This is not a comedy. We've seen this plot many times before only this time the twist is it's a guy that is the victim. I'm not going to go into the plot, if you are curious you are going to see it anyway. Be aware that a heinous and brutal crime is at the centerpiece and is extremely unpleasant to watch.
I have loved everything Kevin Smith has made, and while this is not his movie, it has the same feel to it. At times it feels like the "lost" film between Clerks and Mallrats.
The Kevin Smith cameos, as well as Jason Mewes, Scott Mosier, and some other faces you'll recognize keep the movie interesting. However it has a drawn out scene that is so unpleasant it's virtually guranteed to turn off the casual observer immediately. (the implied torture/murder of a child was particularly vile) This ain't a date flick folks. At times you'll be thankful for what you DIDN'T see while still being repulsed by what you are seeing. On the plus side Brian O'Holloran does a good job as does the rest of the cast in their limited roles.
