What's so good about this movie? Let me tell you, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! The first part that told the story about the tooth fairy was pretty good but then what could have been a pretty scary movie just turned into a flying slasher flick, this time the slasher doesn't use a knife and flys around and grabs people. That's it. It's not a ghost like the story suggests. It's simply a flying Jason Vorhees. I thought it was suppose go after kids that saw it, not go after everybody it sees! It was just appearing everywhere everytime the lights went off. Sometime in the movie, it suddenly appears in the police station. This is where it really gets funny, the police officers see it and start shooting at it. It was flying around the room and the officers were shooting the lights out, letting the thing get them. First of all, why would a ghost appear in a police station? Just to get the main character? That one scene was inserted for pure action. Things get even more stupid at the end. The evil tooth fairy dies from being lit on fire. Stupid! When I was walking out of the theater after the movie was over, one guy behind me was proclaiming he liked it. I just wanted to turn around and sock him in the nose because there is nothing to like about this movie period!
