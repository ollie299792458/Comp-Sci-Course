True Romance is an underated film that would have gotten much more then it deserved. This is a great film with some trademark Terantino dialogue that just really leaves with a feeling. This movie has great action and great humor. The humor involved is witty and funny(classic Terantino). There should have been no reason y this movie didn't become so famous. It has a great cast with Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Anthony Hopkins, Christopher Walken, etc. This movie is ivolved around Christian Slater....a proclaimed loner who falls in love with a prostitute(Patricia Arquette). Christian Slater goes and tries to help her get out of prostituting. The movie evolves around their love and a $5 million dollar suitcase they come upon....Overall this is a great action film.....and this is coming from someone who watches films like Casino, Gladiator, Saving Private Ryan, Chinatown, Taxi driver, and other such great films. The special edition is really great and gives you a lot of bonus features. This is a great movie to own, and it has made it in between all my mob and war movies.
