I bought this movie locally, on impulse, after seeing that it starred Malcolm McDowell. I'd not have bought it if I'd checked the Amazon reviews first.

I was intensely disappointed. I had no clue from the blurb on the packaging that this was a propaganda movie for Christian mysticism.

I should have looked more closely at the Special Features, because if I had, I'd have realised that the legend "DISCOVER THE POWER", printed in big bold letters next to the barcode, was biblespeak for "Discover The Power Of Prayer," and been forewarned.

For anyone else who is an avid McDowell fan, but whose ability to suspend disbelief is limited to the realms of science fiction, surrealism, and reasonably inventive fantasy or horror, my advice is to just watch the quite innocuous first 43 minutes of this movie, to the point of the Civil War reenactment, and stop there. This would be while you are still able to think: "What is everyone talking about? This is quite a decent movie!"

Pretend that this was as far as they got in making the film, or that you watched the entire movie but had a fortunate bout of memory loss. Any excuse. Then make up some possible continuation and ending for the story out of your own imagination.

It doesn't matter how lacking your imagination may be, or how lame the story seems as you are constructing your version of it in your head, there is *absolutely *no *way your version could be as cringeworthy as that of the actual movie.
