I liked this movie for its straightforward plot, its characters, and its special effects.  The plot was simple: evil guys trying to destroy the world, and the good guys trying to stop the bad guys.  Nice if your tired out from a week of work and want to sit down and relax.  Its characters were relatively well-developed; Hellboy himself and the proffesor were done well, Rasputin was a little disappointing, and the 'fire-starter' was okay.  She could have used a little more developement, but I don't really see how it could have been incorporated into the movie without damaging the plot. The effects were excellent; convincing motion on the part of the hell-hounds.  I particularily liked Hell-boys tail.  It was just like a cat's tail in movement and was a nice touch.  I also thought that having Hell-boy miscalculate a jump between buildings was wonderful.  In the Matrix, Spiderman, etc characters are always capable of great leaps (both physical, mental, and social) but never over or undercalculate.  I would have actually given it a 3.5-star rating, but I can't with this rating system.  It loses points for lack of development for the evil characters and plot simplicity (I'm not always tired out and in search of simple action).  All in all a good movie and well-worth buying.
