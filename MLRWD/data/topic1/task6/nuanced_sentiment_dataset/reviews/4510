What would you do if the house that you are living in is part of a college campus and you will be booted from your place? Well everyones knows you go out and try to find a loophole so you could keep your house. Luke Wilson and his friends decide to make a legitimate fraternity so they can keep the house. The movie starts off humorous and ends humorous. Old School is one of those comedies that makes you laugh until you cant laugh anymore while sticking to an interesting plot line.

Old School will keep your eyes glued to the screen through all the parties, nudity, streakings, and outrageous behavior. For a little taste of the humor, imagine Will Ferrel being shot with a tranquilizar gun in the jugular and watching him trip out. Who would of thought that a man with a tranquilizar dart in his neck would be able to survive after knocking over numerous tables, pushing a few kids out of the way, and finally falling into a pool, only to be rescued by the donkey trainer.

Whenever I need a good laugh, or just need to relax, I pop in my Old School: Unrated and Out of Control dvd. Let the "godfather" live on.
