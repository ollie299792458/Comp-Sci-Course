This movie was a favorite of mine growing up in the early 80's, although I must admit that some parts were very, very creepy to me at a young age ( as the other reviewer mentions himself. ) An old creature that hisses and then crumbles after dying isn't exactly Muppet Show mentality.
But then that's how the movie is good, in a certain way. Jim Henson and Frank Oz took a chance and tried something new, creating puppets and landscapes in a dark fantasy movie that recalls both Lord of the Rings and Star Wars in its plot and characters.
I have to say that after over twenty years, the movie holds up very well, overall. While some of the bluescreen work is a little iffy, the remastered DVD makes things look better. The puppets are, for the most part, very life-like ( conceptualized by Brian Froud, who would later work with Henson and Oz on Labyrinth ), and the sleight of hand tricks and camera moves ( check out the puppet>human actor>puppet seamless edits ) to disguise the fact that someone's hand was up the characters' asses was quite slick. Some of the best I've seen. Also, Trevor Jones' music score is inviting and epic, and as a DVD feature, can be heard as an isolated track. 
While The Dark Crystal may be a little *too* dark for anyone under the age of 4, anyone older should be amazed and satisfied by one of the 80's most magical and timeless movies.
