First off this movie is just down right awesome. I got the blu ray version and the picture and sound is great. There's also some nice special features too. When I first heard of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, I was afraid that they were gonna ruin the best sci-fi movie ever made by turning it into a cartoon, I'm glad I was wrong. In my opinion it's way better than episodes 1&2 combined, even though they weren't really as great as 3-6. I never saw it in theaters, I just caught an episode of the series on Cartoon Network, so I decided to give it a shot, not to mention that the blu ray was like $5. I've already ordered season 1 on blu ray and plan on getting season 2. There's plenty of action and humor. The battle droids had me cracking up. Adults will love this as much as the kids, I'm in my 20's and I love it. I was suprised to see that Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, and Anthony Daniels(the only one qualified to do C-3PO) in the voice cast. If you have the choice, get blu ray. I'm not sure how the dvd quality is, but for the price I got, there's not a big difference. Just get it. May the force be with you.
