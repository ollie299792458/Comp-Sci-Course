I really enjoyed this movie.  The level it was working on was somewhat deeper than most.

1) It was centered around unredeemed criminals. That's not too unusual.

2) Billy Bob was not just eccentric & unhealthy - he was psychotic and self-destructive & dangerous & spiraling towards a sad end, and the film didn't sugar-coat that or hedge it's bets with 'redeeming characteristics'.

3) It was incredibly blunt and harsh - more so than your average R movie, but I got used to it.  Christians and people with kids could never stand this (see the 1-star reviews), but they're not the intended audience so it's irrelevant.

From there, Billy Bob finds innocent, well-intentioned folks who he can take advantage of, Lauren graham and the fat little boy, who over time 'break him in' so he can rejoin society & start thinking like a regular person again.

It was uplifting, & the dialogue and story were so warped & unpredictable that I gladly went along for the ride.  The angry Dwarf was also funny - they always are, but he gave a good performance too, full of verbal p*ss & vinegar.

Lauren Graham gave a very short, bare performance that was just smoking hot. Now she's a sarcastic mom on TV.. too bad.

I'm glad this made money.  When I saw that it was produced by the Cohen brothers I knew that it would be eccentric & intresting, and they didn't let me down.
