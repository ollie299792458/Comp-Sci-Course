Telling a story about a group of people is difficult. It can be hard for a story to find focus and it can be hard to wrap up without seeming to leave subplots dangling. That, in a nutshell, is what I found problematic about this movie.
Viewers might also want to know that the story moves on from broad comedy (no pun there, but thanks) to something rather sad. The conclusion seems almost sit-com-esque in a sudden reconciliation of several relationships, which seems a disservice to the characters.
Given these reservations, why four stars? There's an absolute dearth of "Oceans Eleven" type flicks for women. This is probably as good as is gets for a while, so we may as well enjoy. In addition, Julie Walters is in top form -- worth it just to see her performance. The aristocratic performance of Annette Crosbie ("No front bottom!") added a great deal, as did that of other supporters Linda Bassett, Celia Imrie, Geraldine James, Penelope Wilton, Philip Glenister,  and delicious John Alderton. So, in a sense, I award four stars -- if not full stars -- simply for getting this talented and charming lot together.
I viewed this on a home theater with a very large (133") screen and large complement of speakers. Even so, it was difficult to catch all the dialogue. Anyone with the slightest hearing impairment will probably want to use the subtitle feature on the DVD. The large screen was a treat for catching wonderful wide shots of English countryside.
"Calendar Girls" is certainly worth a look, though to my surprise I doubt it is a film I will care about seeing again soon. The film's limitations, despite the hilarious premise and stellar cast, will relegate this one to the back of the shelf.
