Don't buy this movie for dramatic entertainment.  Buy it as a fabulous historical document of the Santa Monica Pier. Anyone who wants a look at the old structure, with its fish cleaning sinks, boat landings, and underpinnings, will be totally thrilled with this film! The movie ends with a fantastic chase scene down under/around the old pier. I was able to wade through the entire mediocre melodrama once, but have viewed it many more times, fast forwarding through the dialogue in order to watch the several sections that offer memorable pier views.  Having grown up, in the late 40's through 60's, with the pier at the center of many happy times, I really appreciate this opportunity to revisit it.  The midway scenes are not actually from the SM Pier.  The production may have used the Ocean Park Pier for these, or built their own sets in order to add a little more action. There is a lot of footage of the arcade hall, with its great pinball machines, as well as shots of the carousel. I think all of this makes this tacky drama worth sitting through.
