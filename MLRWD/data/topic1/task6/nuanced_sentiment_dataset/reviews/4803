I tried to watch the whole thing but only made it through a couple of volumes. This is trash. The title is mis-leading, there is nothing here that defies evolution at all. You have a dentist saying that he doesn't know how an osterich could know how to kick to defend itself. And that means there's a creator. Wow. This is not science, it's pure xian propaganda, and the real arguments between science and creationists have taken place in other videos and books. I've watched many, I keep giving the other side a chance to make some sense. Some actually raise good questions, but not this video series. Nothing new is added to the argument here, just alot of ignorance and repeated drivel from uneducated wing-nuts. I think if I were religious, watching things like this would make me question it. Creationist claims may at least one day serve that purpose, of helping to create such a divide between the reasonable people of the world and the religiously inclined, that the latter may become a smaller and smaller cult. One can only hope.
