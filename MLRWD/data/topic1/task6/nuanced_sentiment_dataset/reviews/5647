Ok,  I tried.  I really,  really tried not to compare the movie with the book.  I loved the book,  a tender, poignant journey of love in which April,  albeit unwillingly, learns to accept the difficult person who gave birth to her and slowly learns the devastating truth of her past.  But Elinor Lipman says she does not mind the fact that Helen Hunt basically took her book and scissored away everything but a few names and the center plot of the book,  and came up with this idiotic film about ticking biological clocks instead.

But I have to wonder,  how can she not mind?  This hash of a movie bears little resemblance to what it was based on,  so why did Helen Hunt not just find someone to write a new screenplay about a woman who wanted to have a baby?  Why did she take a brilliant story,  with fabulous characters,  and turn it into this really rather dumb movie?

In the book,  Bernice is difficult but ultimately complex and suprisingly sympathetic by the end,  but Bette Midler's Bernice is just a cardboard cutout of the same person.  And it's a shame,  because Midler would have played the "real" Bernice beautifully if she had had a decent script to work with.  And in the book,  April is a bit uptight,  but not the brittle, haggard neurotic that is portrayed here.  And while Colin Firth is, as usual,  great to look at,  his character is poorly written as well.  The male "hero" of the book,  Dwight,  and his relationship with April,  are so appealing,  that I cannot believe these two annoying men and their shallow interactions with the main character are supposed to replace that.

I did give this movie two stars because I liked Salman Rushdie playing the part of the doctor and I liked the sweet little twist at the end.  But the whole time I watched it,  I couldn't help thinking of the wonderful book at home on my shelf and asking,  "Why,  oh why,  did someone have to screw it up so very badly?"
