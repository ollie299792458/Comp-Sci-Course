I first caught this film on AMC, and I was just blown away by the cinematography, acting, theme and plot. Ever since then, I've been eagerly awaiting the release of this film on DVD. It's interesting to see how the careers of Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson have turned out over the past few decades. I love the landscapes of both their faces, and how both deal out their violent justice. But where Eastwood has won an Academy Award and been celebrated by the AFI, Bronson has degenerated into making violent trash.
The Man without a Name trilogy was filmed in Europe, but Once Upon a Time in the West made full use of the landscape of the American west. The Morricone music is perfectly matched to the visuals. The final gunfight between Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda blows your mind with the revelation of why Bronson is after Fonda. Henry Fonda is cast against type as a villain, and his tired evil demeanor reminds me of the casting of Tom Berenger in Platoon. Oh yeah, Claudia Cardinale is one major hottie.
