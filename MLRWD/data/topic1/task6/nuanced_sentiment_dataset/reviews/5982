Michael Lindsay-Hogg and Charles Sturridge's superb dramatisation of Evelyn Waugh's greatest novel has not been transferred at all well to DVD.
For such a beautifully-photographed and designed piece of work such as this, one would really have thought that the production company - in this case Acorn Media in Silver Spring, MD - would have pulled out all the stops in mastering this on disc, but sadly they have not.
An inordinate amount of very distracting edge pixellization is apparent on this transfer, right from the opening black and white titles all the way through the following 11 hours of the film. The image is at times very jumpy - distractingly so - and film grain is horribly apparent at times, as well as a fair degree of blurring which I certainly do not remember from the British television broadcasts.
In addition, the entirety of disc 3 - five hours, no less - is out of sync, sometimes terribly so.  Outrageous!
Aside from these complaints, menu design is arbitrary and unimaginative, and lends a cheap feel to the entire experience of watching the three-disc set.
For [the price], devotees of this outstanding series should have got a great deal more.
Don't buy this disc...
