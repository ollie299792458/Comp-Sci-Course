I enjoyed this movie, I really did, but it would have been better if I wasn't trying to figure out how Danielle could be considered a commoner when she's the daughter of a countess. We don't know for sure what rank her father was but it was evidently good enough for him to marry a very snooty and ambitious baroness, so he was almost certainly a nobleman. And if his first wife, Danielle's mother, was a countess he's likely to have been a count. Unless she was illegitimate, which was never suggested, Danielle would have been a noblewoman by birth and of equal rank to her stepsisters. Even if the mother wasn't really a countess, Danielle would certainly have been a gentlewoman, not a commoner. My feeling is that the Angelica Huston character's treatment of her would have been considered quite scandalous by the nobility. She and her fellow servants would most certainly have been aware of all this. Then add in the fact that the word 'courtier', which is used to describe Danielle, was used only for men - women were courtesans. (Granted, the female version has another meaning that wouldn't be appropriate for this movie.)

I guess all that is nitpicking, but it really bugged me and took quite a bit of entertainment value out of what's otherwise a very charming movie.
