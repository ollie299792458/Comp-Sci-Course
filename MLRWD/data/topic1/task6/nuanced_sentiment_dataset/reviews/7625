This was a great film.  it had everything, everything that c ounts.  it built its suspense skillfully.  this version has so much cut out that the story doesn't seem to hang together.  there is one scene (climactic in context) where the crew heaves a collective sigh of relief and smiles break out all around.  in this butchered version, nothing precedes this scene to justify it. the whole sub plot of the missing 9 minutes and the drunken wife and private life of the poor self-deluded navigator are gone. let's not pander, for once, to the kind of idiot who can't appreciate the human dramas in the story, and who can't sit still without loud noise, kick fights and car chases. PLEASE PLEASE issue a "director's cut" or somesuch, with the footage and the sense of the developing disaster intact.  no one has the right to tamper with this film.. i know the footage exists as i have a bootleg copy (all green and purple, but soundtrack's good) and the movie is intact. 50 years we waited, and now this travesty.
