I am a Little Rascals fan, I watched them all the time when I was growing up. They don't televise the re-runs any more and I wanted to introduce my children to some of the wonderful and funny shows I watched as a kid. I was so excited when I saw this DVD collection but was very disappointed after viewing it. I found the description of contents given on the box to be somewhat misleading. The movies on disc 1 and 2 are silent movies with characters I've never seen. Disc 3 has two silent movies and one that actually had sound with some of the characters I was used to seeing. Disc 4 had sound, contained more of the characters I grew up viewing and was actually pretty good, disc 5 was more about a reunion with the characters along with information on other child stars from back in the day. If a slightly broader description would have been given stating that the majority of the movies were silent films and that only approximatly 4 of the movies not discs, had the actors Alfalfa, Darla and Spanky in it, I would not have purchased them. During the time I was a child and watched the Little Rascals, it always had sound. I never knew that some of their films were silent, it would have made a big difference in my selecting this paticular collection. It would have been nice to have this information disclosed in the description on the packaging.
