At 99 minutes, Nanny Mcphee is a light and ultimately forgettable children's film. It had great potential, including a cast of the British luminaries Colin Firth and Emma Thompson, and a good deal of charm and heart, but ultimately failed to deliver on two of its most important attributes: plot and the Nanny. Nanny Mcphee, as a modernized, Willy-Wonka version of Mary Poppins, fails miserably, the worst part being that she's actually frightening. Mary Poppins, as played by Julie Andrews, was strict and firm and occasionally a little frightening, but NEVER cruel. Emma Thompson's nanny is not averse to bringing one of the children to near-death to make sure that they get the point. By the time the little boy has been lifted away from the boiling oil, the children have got the point: Nanny McPhee is boss, and so has the audience; we don't like her. As a "comedic" replacement for Mary Poppins, Nanny McPhee is unfunny, ugly, and burdened with a ridiculous buck tooth and a decidedly odd manner. She is mysterious rather than magical, inhuman rather than "practically perfect", and the plot has the vague feeling of something stretched over too little material. There is a good deal of charm, mostly provided by the children carrying out a series of predictable but highly amusing pranks to drive their prospective step-mother away and by a really beautiful love story that develops in the last 5-10 minutes of the film, and great cinematography, but this only partially cancels out the genuinely creepy parts and the frothy lack of plot. In the end, this is a decent family film, but hardly a classic.
