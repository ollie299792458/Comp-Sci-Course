For a long time now, we have been subjected to various movies that either rip off or pay homage to another.  The comedy style of Not Another Teen Movie is a repitition of what we have seen in I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, Sacry Movie 1 & 2, Don't Be A Menace... and so many others it is impossible to count.  Still, despite what I had heard about the movie, it wasn't so bad.
The humor is rather sickening at times, but I find that sort of thing hilarious so I enjoyed it.  The storylines and scenes are ripped almnost entirely from other movies with some shaving down of the bits we said we didn't like (like the heart warming stuff, et all) and the other funny bits they couldn't fit in.  It was nice to See Pretty In Pink and The Breakfast Club included in the movies that inspired this one, being two of the best ever.
The soundtrack is fantastic, one of the best I have ever heard, though the original recordings on quite a few were better.
In all, I enjoyed the movie but the enjoyment of repeated viewing is quite low, so you would have to absolutely love this movie to buy it.
Also, the parts taken from Cruel Intentions are the best :D
