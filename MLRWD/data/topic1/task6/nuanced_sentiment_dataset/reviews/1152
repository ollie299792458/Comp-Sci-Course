I was curious to see the remake of the original. Caught it on TV the other night. It's an ok film if you aren't doing anything else. However, I feel I wasted my time when I could have rather been watching something else. Something Better. The movie has its moments. However, I would recommend rather watching/buying the original with James Stewart. I just found, especially when the bickering started, one just does not have any sympathy for any of these people. You are just hoping they would all wander out into the desert and die. Slowly. It amazes me how strong and feisty they all are surviving on minimal water and canned peaches. However, when they are stupid anough to approach some wandering Tauregs (or whatever tribes wander the Gobi desert) to ask for water (yea right)-  and this after finding one of their own mysteriously shot -I was hoping one of the team was going to be bumping off the others - would have made for a much more entertaining movie). However, at this stage one actually hopes these desert people will bury them all in the sand,  cover their heads with honey, blow up their plane, and then ride their horses into the sunset, whooping with joy. Now that would have been a good ending. Stupid people should not survive. Even in a movie.
