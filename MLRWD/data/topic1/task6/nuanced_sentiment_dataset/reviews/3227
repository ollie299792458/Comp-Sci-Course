I'm sure that I'm just going to repeat everything that others have said about Reload.  But there are a few things that really need to be said that were missed.

Whomever Geneon got to write the script must have had orders to make it Cartoon Network friendly.  They really toned down the banter between the four guys, especially Gojyo and Goku.  And the new pronounciations, there's one that everyone missed, Hawk-a-ry-u for our dear, sweet dragon/Jeep.

Now about the voices.  As someone who's nearly blind, I can't see the subtitles (and for some reason, friends and family don't like to be disturbed during the show to tell me what everyone is saying) so I rely on the American voice actors.  In the first fifty episodes and Requiem, the actors were real professionals, they were the characters and they sounded like they really were a team.  The new ones are cheap imitations.  Why Geneon would throw diamonds into the trash and replace them with glass, I'll never know.

I'm planning on buying the rest of the DVDs in the new series, just to see what happens.  But am hoping that Geneon will listen to the people that truly count in this deal and bring back the diamonds.
