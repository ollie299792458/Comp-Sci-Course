In recent years Mark Minkowski, who is better known as the conductor of a lot of "HIP" baroque recordings, has made a side-niche for himself in Offenbach operettas. I certainly admire his vision: to him, Offenbach was not merely a composer of charming tunes. Minkowski uses "critical editions" of Offenbach's works, restoring the traditional cuts and giving the operettas lavish stagings with world-class casts. Belle Helene was one of Minkowski's most admired efforts. And it's certainly wonderful to hear Offenbach's complete score played with such brio and committment.

However, I must admit this dvd was a bitterly disappointing purchase for me. And blame must fall squarely on the shoulders of the Helene of this video, Dame Felicity Lott. There's no kind way to put it: she's vocally past it for this video. Her voice is thin and screechy -- she compensates by shrill declamation and hammy acting. The end effect is charmless.

As a nod to her "over-the-hillness" the directors have made Helene a bored housewife of a certain age who's first seen lounging in her bed next to a snoring husband. Thus, the whole "Helen of Troy" storyline is a dream. I suppose it was a clever idea (since Lott both looks and sounds her age) and Offenbach's whole work was a spoof of contemporary Parisian society. I have no beef with the production, really. It's clever and tongue-in-cheek and with the right cast it could really work. But overall Belle Helene is one of those works that cannot survive an unsuitable lead singer. (Think Norma where the production, Adalgisa, and Pollione are all world class but where the Norma is terrible.)
