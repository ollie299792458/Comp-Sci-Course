First, let's establish that I don't think "Giant" is a classic by any definition.  Too long, indifferent acting, too much fluff.  That said, I guess I remember it as a spectacle worthy of the total sprucing up it needed to bring it to DVD.  Tiomkins rousing score in 5.1 digital sound.  Punching up of the very faded VHS tapes film quality and some nice extras.  Maybe 1 out of 3 isn't bad except in this case the extras are the only plus.  Otherwise the movie seems to have been transferred directly from VHS to DVD.  The sound over the opening titles was so tinny and distorted that I double checked my sound settings to make sure my equipment wasn't out of wack.  Nope, just plain lousy monophonic clamor.  The color is so washed out in many places that I started to think maybe I had been sent a preproduction copy before sound and color had been worked on.  But I see several other reviewers had the same reaction.
  Shame on Warner Bros for putting out a major movie of such abominable quality.  The extras are terrific but I know very few film fans who buy movies based on the extras.  Take it off the market and do it right Warners.
