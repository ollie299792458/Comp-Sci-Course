I don't know why some of the other reviewers were so hard on this movie... It is insane. I like to see films like this with alot of different nutty characters. Absurdity and silliness are the keys to all great comedies. Yeah there might be too much profanity in it for the timid types, but so what...f**k them! If you're a Steve Carrel fan like I am, you'll love this movie. You'll love it even if you've never heard of the guy.

I saw the unrated version first, so watching the film without the additional footage isn't the same for me. I can't watch it without the additional scenes now. I'd like to see what the people who gave this film a bad rating consider funny. I'd bet dollars to food stamps that if you looked into their dvd collections you'd find titles such as "Cheaper By The Dozen +2", "American Wedding", "Fever Pitch", etc.

Like the person talking about Daredevil and AVP; both those films sucked extremely!!! The fact that he/she praised them should tell you that they don't know a good movie when they see one. He/She probably watches Blade: The Series...and loves it.
