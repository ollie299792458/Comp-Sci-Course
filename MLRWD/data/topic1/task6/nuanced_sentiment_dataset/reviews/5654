Spoiler alert at bottom of review, so be warned.

Let's see... You've got Wiseau himself looking and sounding like a bad impersonation of Christopher Walken crossed with Arnold Schwarzenegger; his selfish, cheating fianc&eacute; who looks (a little) like Courtney Love, and his best friend - an Owen Wilson wanna-be - caught up in a tragic story of love and betrayal. And horrible dialogue.
This movie is so bad it's great!

I don't know if Tommy Wiseau intended for this film to be the cult-classic it is based on it's cheesy acting and production. He struck gold either way. I watched the interview with him in the special features before I even watched the film and knew I was in for a treat. This thing makes soap operas look like Masterpiece Theatre by comparison. I mean, it is soap opera-ish, but oh, Sooooo BADLY done.

Dan Aykroyd should do a little return to Leonard Pinth-Garnell on SNL and give this Bad Cinema a proper review. You remember when his white-gloved hand tossed the film reel into the waste can. Ah, the early days of SNL... But I digress.

I won't give away the thrilling conclusion of this monstrosity, but my fall-off-the-sofa, rolling-in-pain favorite line was WAKE UP, JOHNNY!!!

Get a few friends together, watch this disc and have a pee-party.
Just be sure to have plenty of cleaning products on hand to remove the stains from your upholstery. Better yet, just line your sofa with plastic, like they did back in the old days.

SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER ALERT!!

Upon reflection, I suspect this movie is completely autobiographical on Tommy Wiseau's part. Right down to the thrilling conclusion. I figure he actually survived at the end, and with what mental capacity he had left to work with after blowing his brains out, he just had to tell his story. How else could a film this bad be written/directed/acted etc.?
Bravo, Tommy! Good for you for surviving.
