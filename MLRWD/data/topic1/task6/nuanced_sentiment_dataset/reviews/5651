Let me make this clear right from the start.  The only thing that saves this film from getting just one star is the wonderful acting of Meryl Streep.  She does a fantastic job of believably playing a gritty former river guide and a loving mom.  The rest of this movie doesn't fare nearly as well.
"The River Wild" is about a mother, father, son and dog who go on an adventure whitewater rafting down a river.  They encounter some shady characters who are rafting down the same river.  I typically break down the plot of the movie in my reviews but it is rather pointless here.  Everything is completely obvious from a mile away and I do mean EVERYTHING.  There are also several completely ridiculous parts of this film.  For one, there is a portion of the movie where the father has to follow along the river on foot through treacherous terrain.  At the same time, his river guide wife is rolling down the river in a raft.  Guess who makes it downstream faster?  That's right...the father.  Give me a break!  There are too many more moronic things like this for me to waste my time going over them.  In short, if you fancy whitewater rafting and Meryl Streep then check this one out.  If you like movies with actual suspense and action then watch something else.
