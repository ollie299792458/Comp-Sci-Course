This movie has Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington.  I am having a great expectation that this movie is as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LPS4BG">GoodFellas [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O7JHSE">American History X [Blu-ray</a>], and even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KSO3M0">Road to Perdition [Blu-ray</a>].  I am hoping that this movie has a great historical significance to the American history. But no. They just talk and talk for 3 hours for how Frank was being hunted down by the good cops.  No action.  Nothing much to learn about Frank (except that he is very smart) or how it is like to live in the 60's. Russell Crowe is pretty good in this movie but all the rest of the casts including Denzel Washington are boring.

One interesting remark they make in the movie is how black people in the 60's can work hard to move up to the ladder even they are criminal. Even the Italian mafia want to see Frank fail. It is a similar remark Gene Hackman makes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059TFO">Mississippi Burning</a>.

I haven't seen the extra in the bluray disc yet. The package itself is just a box with one disc in it.

Nothing special.  3 stars.
