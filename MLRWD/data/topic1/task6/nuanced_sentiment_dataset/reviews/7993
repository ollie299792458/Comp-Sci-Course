I saw "Meet Joe Black" (MJB) in a theater when it first came out. At the time, I thought it was okay, but nothing great. I just saw it again on DVD and now love it. Here are the reasons why:

*For me, the main fascination of MJB is its underlying premise--what can happen when a noncorporal spirit being, the powerful Angel of Death, "takes a holiday" by assuming bodily form. It means that this spirit now experiences all the sensual pleasures and pains that flesh is heir to. He tastes food and develops a fondness for peanut butter; he sees and appreciates beauty in the form of Susan (Claire Forlani); he falls in love and is overcome by its ecstacies as well as its pains. He's also a quick learner in the lesson of being human, rapidly graduating in a few days to the pinnacle of what is best in humanity--our ability to transcend our selfishness for the good of another. In portraying this demanding role, I thought Brad Pitt did eminently well, especially in conveying with his eyes the immense power of the Angel of Death.

*Anthony Hopkins' superb acting: He gives us such nuances of expression, imbuing his Bill Parrish with great feeling and believability. Wannabe actors should watch and learn from his performance, which was a master class in acting.

*The movie's affirmation of life: At the end, watching the glorious fireworks and knowing that his death is imminent, Hopkins remarked to Joe Black that it's hard to tear oneself away (from life). If that doesn't move you, nothing will.

*The movie's moral core: Unlike so many Hollywood flicks these days, MJB takes a moral and supernatural stance--that business can and should be ethical; that it's good that men would want to take care of the women they love; that love means responsibility, wanting what's good for the beloved, and self-sacrifice; and that those who have lived a morally good life have nothing to fear about death.
