The Protestants are really the experts in  deceiving people just like satan, the great deceiver!  Imagine, when I called their line to ordr this on the phone, i asked the person, Is this DVD Catholic or other denomination?  He couldn;t give me n answer!  he was dumbfounded and surprised I knew right away that this is anti-Catholic.  maybe by divine light I was able to decipher what this DVD is all about without first seeing it. The Protestants who made this movie would move heaven and earth just so they can destroy the devotion to Mary and they are using the Bible in doing so.  may God forgive them for this is a grave sacrilege committed against the Mother of God.

For one,  Mary is not an ordinary person like us.  Jesus chose Her, God as He is, and Jesus would not be in a womb of a sinful creature because He is all HOly.  That is why Mary was exempt from opriginal Sin and was called the Immaculate Conception.  And She remained a Virgin during, before, and after Jesus' birth.  How?  It is by the power of the Holy Spirit.  Who dares question that?

Also, why didn't the protestant producers of this dvd just expose their real motives by giving it another title so they won't mislead the people buying this.

I ahve spoken and the Holy Spirit spoke through me and caught that person who answered the phone tongue-tied bec. The Holy Spirit revealed this to me so i was spared of this abominable DVD from buying it.  Thanks be to God...
