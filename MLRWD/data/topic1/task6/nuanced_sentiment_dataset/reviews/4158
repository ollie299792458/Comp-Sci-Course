Oh geez, another predictable, tear jerker that the world in general can do without. I'm a female and I hated Hanging up. It was terrible. The  symbolism of telephones ringing incessantly was a little more than I could  handle. The actors - Meg Ryan - not a favorite of mine; I haven't seen her  in anything I liked since "You've got mail" (or whatever it was  called) with Tom Hanks, and then, she was just reprising her role from  "Sleepless in Seattle". Diane Keaton - great actress in a crappy  role. It is too bad that women of such calibre only get the really stupid  roles and women with absolutely no talent get the good stuff. Lisa Kudrow -  able to play more than her friends character, is also a good actress with a  crappy role. Exactly who wrote this film? The ending was so obvious that I  think whoever wrote it should pay the audience to watch it. All the females  were silly. Every last one of them. There was no dept of character  what-so-ever - none. Walter Matthau was also wasted in that film. A classic  actor with dozens of proper films under his belt. He could do that role in  his sleep. I am inclined to say that perhaps he did. Those scenes with the  photographs and the flashbacks with her mother - nothing new. Only  children, who have not had years of movie going experience would find this  film mildly interesting. I give it a D. But then, I am yet to watch a film  of such calibre which matches up to "A Cat on A Hot Tin Roof".  Nice try Meg. Next time try acting a little. This film belongs on home  video, actually it suits the Lifetime channel, which shows much better  movies than this one.
