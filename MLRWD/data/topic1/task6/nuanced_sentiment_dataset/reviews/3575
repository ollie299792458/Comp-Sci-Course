I'd actually give this 3 1/2 stars.  I'd give it more if it hadn't been packaged as a "delightful comedy", as Judith Crist called it (what was she on?).  Alfie (the character) is a sick, mean, selfish a-hole that deserves to be lonely and miserable.  Of course guys like him never are.  They continue to find people to use and hurt.  And those getting used and hurt deserve it, too.  They should wise up and tell guys like Alfie to take a hike.  
I found this movie thoroughly unpleasant.  And that's fine, because I don't mind unpleasant movies.  It's just that the movie tries to be cute amid all this ugliness.  And the whole subplot about the abortion was just plain yucky, with having to imagine the dead, half-developed fetus in that room purely repulsive.  It's shocking that a movie at that time went so far, yet somehow manages to maintain a reputation as being a "comedy".  
Don't watch this one if you're looking for a good time.  You'll have more fun watching "Judgment At Nuremburg".  I'm not saying there's nothing to be gathered from this film, because there is.  I just found it to be too nihilistic while simultaneously trying to be lighthearted.
