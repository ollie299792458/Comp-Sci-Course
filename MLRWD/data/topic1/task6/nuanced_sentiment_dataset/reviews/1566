I would have given this Ultimate Collector's Edition 5 stars, but I can't because of the glaring omission of any commentaries.

I just don't get it.  If they can round up the principal cast members such as Leslie Nielsen, Anne Francis, Earl Holliman, Richard Anderson, and Warren Stevens in addition to all the film's famous historian fans like Joe Dante, Alan Dean Foster, and Bill Warren for the documentaries; why couldn't they have used these same people to create at least one commentary track?

One of the great things about my War of The Worlds Special Collectors Edition disc is the commentaries from Joe Dante and Bill Warren and Gene Barry and Anne Robinson.  I love all the film trivia and cultural aspects they bring up on these tracks.  I was hoping I'd get the same from Forbidden Planet: UCE.

As the documentary on disc 2 states, this is THE science fiction film of all time and the one that started it all; providing  the inspirations for Star Trek and Star Wars.  Yet, Warner Brothers chose to neglect including a feature that most would consider mandatory for a so -called "Ultimate Edition" for the film's fans.  What a let down!
