I had a rainy, gloomy, dreary day off and was going through netflix on-demand when i noticed that the entire trilogy was featured on there.  So, i decided to watch the first movie to see what it was all about.... INCREDIBLE.  i loved it; it reminded me a lot of one of my other favorites; se7en.  Very creepy and original.  I got all excited and said "this is great!!"  "I'm gonna watch the whole series!!!"  So i watched 'The Girl Who Played With Fire" and was incredibly let down... I was so so disappointed that i decided to post a negative review; my first.

  To this movie's credit, it would be a decent movie if it didn't have to follow "dragon tattoo" because it is absolutely a completely different film than the aforementioned.  Gone is the dark, creepy, brooding, slow paced, and quite realistic(for a movie at least) detective story.  This is a bourne movie.  It's even lit like a bourne movie.  It's incredibly fast paced, has multiple story lines involving less than secondary characters(some random boxer dude and lisbeths girlfriend), and it totally abandons the original plot halfway through the movie.  This is not a creepy serial killer mystery like the first installment.  This is a movie about Lisbeth Solander and her dysfunctional family.  Unlike "Tattoo"  you know you are watching a production here and at parts it feels a little contrived and has very little realism.  They shoulda stayed with the original director!

Speaking of SE7EN, David Fincher has signed on to remake the trilogy, and considering the mans past work, i'm very interested to see what he brings to the table regarding the second and third parts of this series....

Sorry for posting a negative review, as i now a lot of people liked this movie.  I honestly tried to and feel a little let down...
