My review of the DVD will be biased because 'The Sandlot' is my all-time favorite. I generally enjoy movies that require deep thought and understanding, with intricate plots and extensive character development. 'The Sandlot' doesn't really fit what my standards of a Solid Good movie are, it's a fine exception. I bought the DVD mainly for its convenience (since I rarely use VHS),because - really - the movie in any form, would satisfy me. The Special Features didn't seem enough to be categorized as such (mainly just the trailers and one feauturette) but I didn't mind, because the movie is where it's at. I was born in the 80s, so I have no physical connection to the 60s, the decade in which the movie primarily takes place. And I was never (before this movie) particularly interested in baseball, the sport in which the story revolves. But none of that matters. The movie brings you to the decade, it brings you to the game. It's fun, warm-hearted, and relateable. Tom Guiry does an awesome job at portraying the insecure and seemingly geeky new kid Scotty Smalls. His character contrasts, yet agrees well with Mike Vitar's Bennie Rodriguiz, the cool kid, who doesn't need to try. I don't want to get into all the characters, they're all just so much fun. They lived one hell of a summer, one that I wish I could have lived. You can read other reviews for the story. I'm done. Rent it, buy it, or borrow it from me :)
