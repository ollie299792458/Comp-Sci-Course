EGAD!  Every once in a while a film comes along that really sets the bar one notch higher--this is NOT that film.  The premise of this film (I'm surmising here) was to explain WHERE zombies came from.  Might have worked, BUT...!  After 5 minutes of exposition about what happened in 1968 (before the original Romero classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD), film jumps ahead to 2005 where some wooden characters marionette about the sets after becoming "infected" with the zombie carrying, leftover government germ warfare virus that was left laying around the former army hospital converted to a mental hospital for twenty-somethings.  Staffed, of course, by some really vile and corrupt security officers!  Needless to say, mayhem ensues--standard "B" movie fare, but from there it's all downhill (if that's possible when you're already near the bottom!).  Low point is when the ZOMBIES TALK!!!  ZOMBIE 101 teaches us that zombies are UNDEAD, "mindless" automatons that seek only to feed and satiate their hunger.  NOT HERE!  Zombies are flesh dripping, TALKING "I-don't-know-whats" that seem to have a healthy interest in women!  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?????!!!

GOOD POINTS???  A few of the actors TRY to do something with the script (notably the supporting actresses), but there's not much to work with here.  OK idea for where zombies came from, but sadly the writers dropped THAT story line after 5 minutes and dished up this mess!

BAD POINTS--EVERYTHING ELSE!

TO SUM IT UP:  Even the zombies are turning over in their graves about this sorry "prequel" to the Romero classics!  Worth a look ONLY if you have to have EVERY zombie movie ever made in your collection.  Then again, maybe you'll be entranced enough to sit through the whole 103 minutes as I did--kind of like watching a really bad train wreck!
