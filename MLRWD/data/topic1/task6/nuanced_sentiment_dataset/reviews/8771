I wasn't quite sure how to rate this movie.  I have always been a fan of Disney movies and this one just did not feel good like other ones.

The story is about two toys getting lost, and found by a bad boy who mistreats toys (for example, he cuts off the heads of toy figures and puts the heads in lava lamps to float around).  The two toys who got lost in the first place hate each other until the end of the movie, so they are bickering the whole time while trying to escape the dark atmosphere of the bad boy's room.  Of course every story has an antagonist that generates an antagonistic feeling, I feel that TOO much of this movie was spent in the dark atmosphere.  All the name-calling between Woody, Buzz, Potato Head, etc just bugged me.  The end of the story turns out wonderful, of course, and some of the scenes are really fun and heartwarming -- but really I don't get a good feeling from this movie in general.

It's not something I particularly like my kids watching.  I cringe every time my 3-year-old asks to see "The Buzz Movie."  He LOVES Buzz, who is the main "good guy" in the movie, and I let him have a Buzz-decorated bedroom at his request.  But I limit how much he can actually watch this movie and try to counter it with more generally positive movies like Cars, Finding Nemo, or shows on Noggin.
