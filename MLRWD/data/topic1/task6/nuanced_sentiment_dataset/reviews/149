Rat Race is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while!
The Plot- A  bunch of people selected by winning a special coin while playing the slot machine at casino in Las Vegas are selected to do a once in a lifetime job and race to find 2 million dollars in a locker in Silver City, New Mexico.The stars of the movie are in such a hurry to get the two million bucks,that they do some very stupid/funny things to get the cash.The whole movie is very funny and not dull or boring one part of the entire movie.
The reason I gave this DVD 4 stars is because the deleted scenes, I personally thought were not that exciting. Just remember, that's my opinion. You may love them, but I'm not that crazy about them. Everthing else in the movie was EXCELLENT!!!
