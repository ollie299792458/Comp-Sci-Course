This movie blows. if you are expecting chucky in all his glory forget it! Child's Play's franchise is gone! Forever! This movie is even worse than the last installsment! COME ON! Whats wrong with people? They made this cheap "sequel" because they wanted to make money. its so offensive!

There isnt even a plot. Chucky and his silly bride are in hollywood somehow. The "humor" fact is st*pid. If you find the scene funny where Chucky is masturbat*ng, im sorry but you are sick. thats not even laughable. there is no gore in this movie. Now then there comes the boy. remember chucky's kid that was born at the end of Bride of Chucky? he is here in this movie. but guess what? no sharp teeth, is not even scary! and to top it all the boy doesnt know if he is a female or a male. bad scripted, bad acting! waste of money.

I dont think ill be seeing chucky for awhile. is not an horror movie anymore, is just the cheapest "comedy" out there. avoid this at all cost! dont waste your money.
