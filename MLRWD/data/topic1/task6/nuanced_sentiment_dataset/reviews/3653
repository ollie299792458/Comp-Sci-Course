Better than average Gwyneth Paltrow movie based on the Dickens novel of the same name. Though the purists may howl it is not a bad effort at a contemporary retelling of this old victorian favourite. All the better for  having such an exemplary cast led by Robert de Niro as the magwitch  character and Anne Bancroft playing it for all its worth as the senile and  eccentric Nora Dinsmoor. A worthy successor to the aged and abandoned Mrs  Haversham. I just loved her...and pitied her. What a tragic  sight.
Director Cuaron transfers his story from the misty and fog bound  moors to the sunny ambience of 1997-Miami. Funnily it works. Ethan Hawke as  Finn the central character and whos acting skills I had serious doubts  about manages to age effortlessly here from inadequate teenager to  confident but lovelorn adult. So maybe the man can act!. Chris Cooper also  does a wonderful portrayal as Joe, Finn's kindly brother-in-law, abandoned  by Finn's faithless sister he captures an image of pathos when he finds  himself out of place at Finns first gallery opening. A first rate actor who  is in no danger of being typecast. In the end Gwyneth carries the movie as  the distantly cold and enigmatic Estelle. She gives new meaning to  aloofness. Amazingly in her brief career she has yet to play two similar  types in any of her films. A recommended film for those nights when nothing  better is on the box. Enjoy.
