The story of Bernadette of Lourdes is a testament to Truth and Faith rewarded with spiritual reality. An acknowledgement of an inner world made manifest in love and healing. This film depicting the life of Bernadette and the events which swirled around her, has also stood the test of time, as a beautiful, moving and inspiring experience. The film could have become top-heavy with all the Hollywood effects,splendid sets and crowd scenes submerging the conviction and the message of the miracle of Lourdes. But it is in the acting, coveyed with great sincerity and understanding that uplifts this film and saves it from becoming another Americanis-ed sanctimonious effort.
The book upon which the film is based, was written as a " thank-you" to the people of Lourdes, who had hidden and looked after the author during WW2, saving his life. A huge best seller the book was well researched and movingly written.
This same sincerity and honesty of feeling is carried through the film, and right at the centre Jennifer Jones stands alone-- superb and supreme in her portrayal of the chronically ill, very under-priviledged, uneducated peasant girl, who through her love and faith never doubted,denied or deserted her Visitations. Jennifer Jones certainly deserved her Best Actress Oscar, giving a performance that is resrained yet glowing; subdued yet powerful; humble but inspired.
The film is broken into two parts. The first depicts the events leading up to the revelation of the spring in the grotto and the second half, its effect upon the village, its inhabitants and upon Bernadette and her family.
The DVD brings a clearer print of this magnificent film. It is crisp, with fine tones. the extras add to the interest of the film, and altogether this is an intensely moving film experience. I bought this DVD and highly reccommend it.
