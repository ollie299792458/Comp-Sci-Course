When the beginning of this movie opened I was absolutely sure I wouldn't like it.  It started out so far from the book it was laughable.  First of all, the main character in the movie was Shane, however in the novel the main character happened to be the little boy named Bob (aka Joey as seen in the movie).  Bob was the narrator of the entire book and we see what happens through a little boys' eyes.  Not just as an observing fly on the wall, watching everything happen around it.  Secondly, I didn't exactly enjoy the way it was so lacking in accuracy.  When Shane first arrived at the Starrett farm in the novel he was wearing all black, and there seemed to be a lot of detail in the way Bob noticed him.  While in the movie there was very little in describing Shane through the boy's thoughts.  It seemed that the child said very little at all and had even less running through his mind.  However if you wanted my honest opinion on the movie itself, I'd have to say it was good.  I didn't have any problems with the acting in this film and found that the fight scenes were very much like the ones depicted in the novel.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone who has NOT read the book!
