If you own or seen the original then this is just a rental here. If not rent or buy the 1976 version then rent this one.

Things I like about the remake:
The casting was great. To have Mia Farrow as the nanny, Mrs. Baylock is a great salute to her role as the Anti-Christ's Mother in "Rosemary's Baby"
Harvey Stephens, (The original Damien), as Tabloid Reporter #3, is a great cameo role. He was the the one who said "Was she on drugs Ambassador?"
Liev Schreiber, the father of Damien, is a younger version of Gregory Peck almost exactly.
Julia Stiles is good as Damien's mother.

I also liked that they brought the movie up to date, and all the turmoil that is happening in the world today.

Things that make this movie just a rental:

I read the book and own the original movie(s), and everything was exactly the same. (They may have changed some very minor details but even the dialog is almost the same, and they may have improved on some deaths, but I knew exactly what was going to happen).
Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick seems a little too old to play a five year old Damien, and Harvey Stephens as the original was cuter, and also more evil looking for being so cute.
The extended scenes and extended ending are just that, "extended"! Nothing to see here folks. Just move along. All 3 scenes have a slight bit more blood and thats it.
The worst part of this remake was the ending. At least in the 1976 Richard Donner clasic, you're in suspence of who's funeral it is at the end. This one Slaps You In The Face, and says "No surprise here Bud!!!

If you want a better remake buy King Kong, or even Planet of the Apes, (at least that one tries to be different).
