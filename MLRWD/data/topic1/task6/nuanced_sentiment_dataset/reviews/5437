From start to end, the scenes are gloomy, dim, and depressing. From the onset, you would think that story would follow the Paranormal trail. As the priests turn into forensic experts, the narration comes to focus on the unfortunate sin of incest. The clues develop as the events unfold. Yet, the most stressing aspect of the movie was the playful scare tactics of  the moviemaker that attempted to add an aura of terror. Most of the scenes are unclear and served no purpose in charging the viewers' emotion. The tragic story suffices traumatize a rational person.

The outcome of the story is most probably the most established practice since the rise of mankind. In many cultures, the offspring of sin is eliminate together with the vulnerable target. Here, the vulnerable target will live with greater wounds than being eliminated.

The end was definitely well thought. The respected priest participating in a clandestine abortion leaves the viewers with endless thoughts. The church stepped in to help a hopeless family when no other authority could. The outcome was the murder of a newborn. Had the government stepped in, many citizens would have suffered endlessly under the heavy hand of state. The priest gained nothing by daring to endorse the harsh reality.

"Cut off" summarized the underlying causes of the unfortunate outcome. The brother and sister were cut off society, slipped into sin, where the community was kind enough to lend help: kill the newborn.
