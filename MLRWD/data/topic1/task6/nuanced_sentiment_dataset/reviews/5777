I love empire records. I'm well aware that it is not a particularly good movie and that there are many things wrong with it, but it reminds me of my childhood (I was 11 when it came out) and I loved it back then so I love it now because it brings me back to a simpler, more innocent time. That being said, this version of the movie is bloody awful. They changed soooo many things. Different music, omitted lines, omitted scenes, added scenes (which are all awful and take away from the charm of the movie btw...they were best left on the cutting room floor...). It gives the movie a totally different vibe, which for fans of the movie is like blasphemy. Not to mention taking out lines and scenes and music that are a huge part of what fans love about the movie......???? Travesty. Total travesty. The bigger travesty though is that there is little warning of this. The description does mention that there's 16 minutes of added footage but it does not mention all the other changes/omissions NOR does it clearly explain that this extra footage is plopped right into the movie (as opposed to being available in the special features) or that there's no option to watch the original theatrical version of the film...the version that FANS know and love...and since this DVD claims to be a special "fan edition" its upsetting that they seem to have completely forgotten about the fans. Don't buy this DVD If you love empire records. You're better off just saving your money for the non-special edition DVD and just watching whichever deleted scenes are available on that. This version of the movie is TERRIBLE...definitely not worth the money. I feel like ive been serriously ripped off....I want to watch the movie that i love...not the version that wasn't good enough to release in the first place.....
