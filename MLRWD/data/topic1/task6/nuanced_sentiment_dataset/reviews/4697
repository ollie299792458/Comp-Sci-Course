What the chain of command at Disney from executive to computer restoration "genius" seems to have missed is that this film perhaps above all others needs to keep the grain and shimmer from the original medium: film.  This could have been done on DVD - you can control everything - but what we have here is antiseptically clean and dead.  The image is so crystal clear you can see the prosaic brush strokes on the background.  There is no "weaving" or slight unsteadiness caused by the minute variations in the sprocket holes in camera or projector.  The result is that the image ceases to "breathe", or to seem as if it is photographed by a real camera in real time, but instead looks like a still shot of a tacky greetings card.  This is particularly noticeable when there is no character in the shot, or when the camera has taken several extra frames of a cel where a character pauses between actions.  Grain and film vibration were the unintentional and largely unrecognised secret extra ingredients that gave this and other classic animated films true sparkle and the illusion of life.  Now they are gone.

The rest of the DVD, the care, the extra features, are all exemplary and deserve admiration and in a way the clean-up job is remarkable and fascinating.  But the slightly sad thing is that there is not a prayer that anyone at Disney will ever admit that any cog in their million-dollar restoration machinery has got it wrong.  After all the investment, the reputations at stake, the thousands of accolades for the enhancement, the self-congratulatory "how Bambi was restored" featurette, who is going to dare to consider that rock-solid backgrounds and shimmerless grain-free texture might not after all be what does justice to this great work?
