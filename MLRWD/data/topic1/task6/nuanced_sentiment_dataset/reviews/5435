This has got to be one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen.  I laughed so hard that I walked out of this movie feeling as if I had done 200 crunches.  There were very few low points in which the humor died down.  Most of the time I was in tears, laughing hysterically.

The story is about 2 male skaters that are extremely competitive.  Their scores were tied and they both shared the Gold medal spot for a brief moment.  They began fighting which resulted in their removal from the men's single ice skating competitions for the rest of their lives.  After failing to achieve any sort of happiness with odd jobs (Ferrell ends up skating for a children's ice show and Heder ends up working for an ice skating shop)they agree to skate together in the couple's skating competitions.

Ferrell plays a sex addicted, egotistical guy who seems to be very low on the IQ scale.  Heder plays a soft, effeminate guy who has lived a very priviledged life (until he gets kicked out of men's skating and his adoptive father disowns him).  The two personalities clash to no end.

My husband and I truly enjoyed this show.  There are a lot of sexual references made in the movie but it's used in a hilarious way.  I wouldn't recommend younger children watching the movie simply because of the references.
