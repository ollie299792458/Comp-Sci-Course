I must have seen this episode at least a dozen times, why? Well, the plot couldn't be simpler, a lot of the guest cast have nothing to do and as far as a serious entry into Doctor Who canon, It lacks any sort of scrtuiny. Despite all this however (or thanks to this, depending on your point of view), it is still probably the most entertaining out of the 150something episodes of Doctor Who produced.Great celebration for a fan, wonderful entertainment value if your not.All the Doctors give their finest performances, in particular Richard Hurndall, recreating the roll of the first doctor in such a way, you almost forget who Hartnell is, or end up wishing they had just cast Hurndall back in 1963. The only sad thing is that one is left with the terrible feeling 'Think of all the wonderful extras that WON'T have been put on it!' Having said that, we can now at least hope for a release of the original version (with more extras) in later years. This is one episdoe you really can watch again and again!
