Easy Rider is a counterculture touchstone.  It also was a trailblazer in the independent film market.  There had other hippie movies before, but they were mostly bad films about drug use.  Easy Rider tells the story of two hippies, played by Dennis Hopper &amp; Peter Fonda, who motorcycle across the country from California to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.  They had just made a big drug score and are using that money for the trip.  Along the way, they stay at a commune in the desert, get caught up in a dispute in a small town and of course take alot of drugs.  There is a scene in a New Orleans graveyard that visualizes an acid trip.  Jack Nicholson shows up as a drunk who is constantly being jailed.  He rides along with Mr. Hopper &amp; Mr. Fonda and meets an untimely death. The role garnered Mr. Nicholson an Oscar nomination and catapulted him to stardom.  The film is visually pretty and well shot and they make great use of rock songs as no other movie had beforehand. The film was also a commentary by hippies about hippies.  It is supposed to show that hippies are just peace loving people who embody the freedom America is supposed to give people.  They are unfairly persecuted by small-minded people who judge them by the length of their hair.  At the time, this was all groundbreaking stuff.  The problem is that the film hasn't aged well in the 30 years since it's release.  It is still cemented back in 1969 and now is just a relic from that time.  The film's power should be more judged for the doors it opened up for other maverick film makers like Martin Scorcese, Peter Bogdanovich and other later ones like Quentin Tarantino and Spike Lee.  Before Easy Rider, you had to play within the system.  After it became a huge success, you could go underground and get daring pictures released.
