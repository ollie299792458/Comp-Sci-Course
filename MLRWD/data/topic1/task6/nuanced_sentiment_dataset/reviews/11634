This movie is crap. IT's got so many holes it should be called swiss cheese-the desecration of anne rice. Not that her books were deep philosophy anyway, but they are pretty good in a genre primarily defined by slashers and copious gore. It starts off with stuart townsend, the new lestat. He does ok, but mainly as a goth guy sex symbol who wouldve been better suited to a movie like rock star. The music is haunting at least, thanks to korn's jonathan davis at vocals, unfortunately the soundtrack doesnt even have that, as they lost the rights after and replaced it with the crappy original singers.

Aaliyah is akasha, the queen of all vampires, who falls in love with lestat and tries to take over the world. In the book, she is a vicious and primal female deity, like an amazonian demon come to life. Also, in the book she is ended by her struck mute twin sister, a much more fitting ending than this. In the book, she is one of those who is power hungry and has been scarred by men, thus becoming the embodiment of unchecked feminism, trying to "cull" and control all men to protect herself and other women. In the movie, the only thing she has going for her is being half naked all the time. I think aaliyah is one of the hottest women on earth, and i still couldnt stand her in this movie. The script is horrible anyways, and she is as stiff as natalie portman in star wars on all her lines. Also, since she unfortunately died, they went with the bad decision and sort of cropped the movie together from the handful of scenes they got beforehand, as sort of a dedication to her. I wouldve rather they refilmed it with someone else and a better script, and kept those scenes as extras. This movie is supernatural schlock, not horrifying, not exciting, not erotic, not really redeemable in any way possible.
