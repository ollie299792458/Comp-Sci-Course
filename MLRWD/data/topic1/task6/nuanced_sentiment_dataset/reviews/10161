is a simple title, seemingly without a lot of thought.  After all, two major events happen 28 days later from the previous scene and because the budget of the movie was relatively cheap, this cannot be blamed. However, the movie is quite well pondered.  The plot is simple, but the details are intricate.  Viewers do not know what happens outright, it is revealed slowly and surely through foreshadowing and scenes of great suspense.  The problem is that I purchased this DVD in the horror section.  To me, the horror section is very specific, and this is not horror in my terms, but I guess it is due to genre lumping.  Horror contains twists and turns; this movie is more like a haunted house at Halloween Horrow Nights in Universal Orlando with everytims jumping out at you.  Making up for the lack of true in the acting script is the lighting and mood that is created in teh last scenes of the movie.  This film is strongly suggested, by me, for those interested in the Apocalypse sub-genre, that like suspense on the screen, and/or enviromentalists hardliners.  Other than that, this motion picture if iffy, stay away... (from monkeys).
