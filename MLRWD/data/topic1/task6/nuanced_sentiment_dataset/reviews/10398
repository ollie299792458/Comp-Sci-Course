"Hello, I'm Bob.  Would you knock me out, please?"  To paraphrase Bob on Neil Diamond, there are two types of people in this world -- those who like What About Bob and those who don't.  It's such a shame comedies never really win oscars -- especially for absolutely priceless Richard Dreyfuss here.  (It's a toss up between this and Groundhog Day for Bill Murray's best.)  Human crazy glue patient Murray and "Baby Steps" author/psychoanalyst Dreyfuss and his "fam" trying to take a vacation -- "just me and the family and my book" -- years since its release, I still sometimes leave What About Bob running as background priceless comic relief and it's still Dreyfuss who leaves me sore and speechless.  (It does get a little bit weak at the end, but the flying bust of Freud pretty much makes up for that.)  The memorable quotes are nonstop.  "That patient Bob committed suicide. Oh, well, let's not let it spoil our vacation."  Perfect "who's the crazy one?" writing, beyond perfect comic timing and acting, perfect silly soundtrack -- near perfect casting including Julie Hagerty as the dangerously naive wife whose blouse is the same fabric as the couch and the bus driver "Wing" ("You think you can do it today, Bob?  We have a baby schedule to keep.").  "I feel good, I feel great, I feel wonderful."  There should be midnight showings ala Rocky Horror of What About Bob.  Not to be missed, sometimes not to be taken out of the VCR.
