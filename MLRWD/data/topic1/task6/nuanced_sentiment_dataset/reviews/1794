Almsot painful to watch.  It's shot sort-of well (well above average for TV), and edited with energy, but there are too, too many factual errors, simplistic to a fault and the live-action HD recreations and absolutely terribly shot and terribly put together.  There isn't an ounce of authenticity, care or attention-to-detail paid to anything shown on screen in the recreations.  Obviously this is where the budget was chopped and pretty much and old thing was thrown in front of the camera as "good enough"... being that this was financed by Americans (History Channel) and then produced in Europe and shot in South Africa - the only thing created in the U.S. seems to be the useless on camera commentary by a collection of "who the hell is that?" and "why is Melissa Etheridge talking about the American Revolution... ".  it's a weird collection of on camera commentary.  I just don't like how this was put together, and sadly it's popular in classrooms and for teachers just because its simplistic and has "lots of energy" - but like a candy bar - it's sugar and no substance.  too bad.
