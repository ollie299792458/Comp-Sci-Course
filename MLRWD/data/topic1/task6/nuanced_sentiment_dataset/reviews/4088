way back when, in school, one of my professors proclaimed this Williams's best play. i agree with him wholeheartedly (with "Streetcar" up there, with its very similar theme/themes, ie. human frailties and those who prey on their fellow human creatures).
its over-the-top gothic horror and mix of Catholic and pagan imagery is near-breathtaking. and it's worth noting that a life-size model/statue of St. Sebastian, the "beautiful boy martyr," is prominently displayed in its main character's studio/study/abatoir. Sebastian Veneble, though we only see him in memory flashbacks, is the main character of this film: without him, there would be no "Suddenly, Last Summer."
i sincerely want to avoid offending anyone, Catholic or otherwise, but this movie plays like a Catholic Mass conceived and written by H. P. Lovecraft (and it must be Lovecraft: his florid, even at times epicene, Victorian style is mandatory). it's Transubstantiation/Eucharist/Communion with a horrifying twist. to my knowledge there has been no opera written based on the play, though it strikes me as being near-perfect for an intense one-act opera.
if nothing else, "Suddenly, Last Summer" is a movie lover's only chance to see Hepburn and Taylor in the same film. this and "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" should be mandatory for anyone who's dismissed Elizabeth Taylor as a serious actress.
