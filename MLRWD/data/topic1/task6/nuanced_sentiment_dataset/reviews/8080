I'm ashamed for the human race that there are people giving this movie 5 stars.
Did I miss something?  Like the middle 30 min of the movie?  They must have cut out a whole bunch of stuff because the holes in the plot are  obscene.  For instance, if the ghosts weren't let out until just after  Price throws his wife through that wall, how was that other girl already  cut up and put on display on that wall? (totally unecessary).
That's  another thing.  I'm not a big fan of gore, but it's not what made me hate  this movie with a passion.  There was absolutely no effort put into making  this thing.  You never see what happens to a few of the characters, and  most importantly, WHY THE HELL WERE THEY THERE?  I mean, there had to be  a reason, or did the ghost at the begining just think,"hmmm, I'll put  down Joe Shmoo, John Smith, Jane Doe, etc."? 
Even though no one  will ever read this review so far at the end of the list, I just felt the  need to warn you all.  I'm going to start walking down the streets of D.C.,  just walk up to random people and yell,"DON'T SEE THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED  HILL!  PLEASE! "
