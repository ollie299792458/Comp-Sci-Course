Horrible, truly horrible. I lost a little more faith in the human race after sacrificing 90 minutes or so of my life on this assault on the senses. I hope this movie wasn't intended for the over 10 crowd. Any homosapien with a working brain that enjoyed this should be donated for use as human shields. American movies just get worse and worse. It's an insult. By the way I'm sure they will make a third one of these steaming piles of horse manure. Outside of this drek the new thing now is just taking any old TV show or movie and, drumroll........REDOING IT! WOW, WHAT GENIUS! The way they make it DIFFERENT though is the make it much WORSE than the origional. You see how they pull that off? Great huh? Just yesterday in the same breath I heard of the two latest redos. Dallas and get this, The Dirty Dozen!?! Now is NOTHING sacred any longer? Can't wait for Miami Vice (sic) I'm sure that will be just great. At what point did they stop even TRYING to make good movies. They have become just sheer product with no artistic merit whatsoever. I don't bother to go the movies any more. $9.50!!!! No thanks, I'll stay at home and watch Full House reruns on Nick at Nite before I'll do that. My last point going back to the Charlie's Angels movie, this thing plays like a 90 minute inane music video. Enjoy.
