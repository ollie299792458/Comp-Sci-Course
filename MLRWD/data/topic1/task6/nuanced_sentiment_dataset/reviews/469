Would you rather have them release the same disc but with a new ten minute featurette and actually try to push it as a new edition?  Anyone who pays attention to DVD releases and re-releases should not be surprised or angered by this DVD.  They are not trying to fool anyone who already has the DVD into buying it again.  If anyone is so dumb that they buy it again because it has a new cover, and don't bother to check to see whether there is any other difference, well then that person was too dumb to have their money for long, and would have wound up getting swindled out of it soon anyway.  It is not unusual, uncommon, or surprising at all to see a rerelease like this with differen't cover art.  Sure it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, as the original cover art was perfectly fine, and I'm sure there are still thousands of copies of it floating around store shelves all over the place, but it's hardly a crooked attempt to make duplicate sales.  Think of it this way.  DVD's are produced, and sell out.  So then they produce some more copies.  Usually they just put out identical versions to the previous run, but sometimes they decide to alter the packaging.  Sure they are planning on selling a lot of these DVDs because of the new remake.  So they were probably just going to push out more copies, and then decided to change the cover art to add something about the remake.  It's not a big deal.
