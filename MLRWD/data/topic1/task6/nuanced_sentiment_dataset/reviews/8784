...But it may be something more genuinely childlike.  Comparing the films is interesting, as they were both children's musicals of the same era.  While "Oz" gives its source a high-budget mounting that stresses reassurance and a suburban outlook, "March..." seems to plunge wildly into the very soul of childhood.  True, the 1903 operetta borrowed from Norse mythology and Victorian melodrama, but this filming is astute and timeless--full of the true glee, horror, pain, chaos, and eeriness of childhood.  I loved "Oz" as a child, but this movie was unforgettable: the wistful, melancholic score, cruel humor, stark terror, bursts of frenzied joy, and aura of creepiness struck deep in me.  No matter what benign illusions we eventually form about childhood, this is how the world truly looks at a certain age.  I watched it with a jolt of recognition, and, finally, liberation.
"March..."'s modest budget is more than made up for by its emotional genuineness.  Listen for the latent sadness in the melodies, watch for the decidedly sinister cast to the sets and even the most whimsical Mother Goose characters, marvel at the berserk energy of the finale.  If "Oz" were a Disney feature cartoon, this film would be a Hieronymous Bosch painting adapted for children by the Fleischer Brothers.  It has a similar sense of turmoil, unease, primal beauty, and hilarity.  Children growing up on the perky, bland kids' movies of today will be exhilarated.  And Lewis Carroll, Roald Dahl, and other true geographers of the childhood soul would have approved.
