Compiled mostly from the internet stories of Japanese kids, ALL ABOUT LILY CHOU CHOU is as visionary as it is excsssive, and equal parts riveting and excruciatingly dull. The fact that we're talking abou the same film suggests that there's a wild inconsistency in Shunji Iwai's story.

The story, as such, is remarkably simple: a bullied teenage boy in rural Japan retreats into a fannish love for pop  idol Lily Chou Chou, whose ballads embody his isolation and hopelessness. The onus of bullyiing is spread on this framework - a kind of social Darwinism from which some do not escape. The details of the film cover fairly mundane, everyday life of its young characters, conveyed through a range of film techniques: wide-screen, jerky video, narrative...even a computer screen. As such, the  film may come off as a technical tour de force for some.

The subject matter can be brutal, and it's up to the viewer to determine whether courage or excess is in evidence. If you're not adverse to watching scenes of gang-rape and torture, you'll to contend with stretches of the film that require a great deal of patience; certainly, the fast-forward button may be an agreeable middle ground for most viewers. But even fans admit the film's inconsistent storyline and pretentiousness. You may find yourself saying, "Do I have to sit here and watch this?" ALL ABOUT LILY CHOU CHOU offered me nothing I hadn't seen before, better, and really quite often.
