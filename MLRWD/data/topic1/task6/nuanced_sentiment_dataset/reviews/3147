Here is another 60-second SNL sketch stretched into a feature-length film (well, sort of, it's barely over an hour without the credits). And  stretched it is, quite thinly. 
The premise of the series of sketches the  movie is based on features two brothers played by Will Farrel and Chris  Kattan. The brothers rarely speak, and the sketches are allegedly made  humorous because they're constantly jerking their heads to the side to the  steady beat of cheesy dance club music, regardless of whether or not the  music is present.
This is the one joke the movie owes its existance to.  The good news is that the brothers abandon the head jerking for the  majority of this film. The bad news is that removing the head thing  eliminated that one joke, and they forgot to add others in. Maybe they  tried, but it's hard to tell. The plot is entirely inessential and wearily  generic, serving only to place the brothers into new locations to make  wisecracks, and occasionally, have sex. Much of what is meant to be humor  is so woefully unfunny it's almost painful to watch.
But enough of that.  In the event that someone may happen to find some elusive perspective from  which A Night At The Roxbury has any redeeming value whatsoever, it is  recommended that he or she stick with the VHS version rather than the DVD.  The DVD, of course, comes with the advantages intrinsic to all DVDs: Longer  life, no rewind time, and better sound and video. But that's all. No  bonuses are included on this disk, save the theatrical trailer, which is  hardly of any value to anyone without Farrel's and Kattan's portraits  tattooed on their body. And in this sort of movie, sharper video and audio  don't really matter.
Recommended only for hardcore SNL fans. DVD  recommended only for hardcore SNL fans who absolutely must have everything  on DVD.
