Five stars aren't enough. Put this one in the time capsule with "2001".

There's a feeling I've gotten at other "real" moments of my life, which I get every time I watch this film. When Beale's impromptu rants begin I feel absolutely justified and gloriously alive. But that feeling subtley evaporates once they legitimize him by giving him his "own" show. One filled with fortune tellers and gossipmongers that put Beale in the "correct" context. To me this is one of the revealatory moments; everything this "media" touches looses it's soul. It doesn't matter if it's a person, or an idea. The fact that even the terrorists can't see what they're loosing by engaging with the network rings so true, it's nauseating. I can only imagine what Paddy might have written about the internet. Perhaps the numbers of the beast are just 1's and 0's.

Ned Beatty is riveting every single time. His utopian spin on the world corporation is both terrifying and beautiful. His character shows all to well how tempted one is to justify a life that centers around these ideas. He was aparently channeling a preacher for his performance, but everytime I walk away with Hitler flavor in my mouth.

The Dinah Shore interview on the 2nd disc is an essential edition to this package. Paddy's description of HOW he watches tv has to be a first in broadcast history, and when he talks about "car wreck" shows I was horrified to realize that executives must've seen this movie as an instructional film rather than a cautionary tale. "Turn me off right in the middle of this sentence!"
