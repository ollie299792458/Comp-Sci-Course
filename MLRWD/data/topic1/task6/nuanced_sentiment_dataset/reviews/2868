This film strikes a very interesting balance.  On the one hand, it is relatively intelligent for a 1950s alien movie, has half-decent dialogue, and the characters aren't a bunch of shoot first, ask questions later imbiciles.  On the other hand, the alien and his ship look hillarious, some of its actions are quite silly (when you learn what its supposed plan is, it is so illogical you can shoot a million holes into it and a much simpler solution to its problems is obvious (see below for mine)), and you can, e.g., see some very obvious backdrops and it makes relentless use of fog machines (although with an explanation).  As a result it lives up to neither extreme of "The Day the Earth Stood Still" or "Plan 9 From Outer Space", so while it definitely has a charm all its own and is worth watching, it isn't an absolute classic (cheese or otherwise).
Basically, a planet ("X") of mysterious origins is going to pass near the earth.  A good scientist, his attractive daughter, a dashing reporter and a bad (but not mad) scientist are in the small English town where the planet will pass nearest to investigate, and they discover a spaceship and its passenger (who happens to have a mind control device) in the moors.  The most interesting aspect of the film is that you are never quite sure of the alien's motive.  Is it friend or foe?  Even the ending manages to cleverly keep this concealed (it helps that it is quite difficult, even after hearing the supposed plan, to quite figure out what the alien hopes to accomplish through its actions). This movie is a fun, entertaining little diversion.
SOLUTION TO ALIEN'S PROBLEM (SPOILER WARNING): If your planet is too cold and you have the technology to change it's orbit so it will precisely pass near a warmer, habitable planet, why not just move your planet into a decent orbit?!?!
