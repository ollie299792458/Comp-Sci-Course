This is an excellent anime that I do highly recommend to anyone who is interested. There have been a bunch of bad reviews for this and it makes me wonder how much anime they have watched. Some of the principle complains are plot and ending. Any anime fan knows that the Japanese and Asian cultures NEVER "force feed" you a plot. Which seems like the bad reviewers want and they have almost ALWAYS left the ending open. They like to do that so you yourself can theorize and discuss what the ending means to you. This is how animes have been done since I have been watching them (20 years). I understand that the American culture likes structured beginnings, middles and ends. But I am sorry if you havent figured out the Asian culture loves the way they make their animes and they are not going to change it. I will admit that there have been plenty of times that I have watched a series, that I loved, and have been totally pissed off at how it ended. But I know that it is the nature of the beast and I own every series that has pissed me off because they are amazing works of art. I hope this helps anyone who actually reads the reviews before you buy the product.
