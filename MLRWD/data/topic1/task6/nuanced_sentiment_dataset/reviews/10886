This film is horrific. The people who directed and produced this film completely missed the point of the book. If you've never read the book it would be moronic and ignorant to judge the story based on the film.

Flowers in the Attic is one of my all time favourite books, I read it as a child many times and it took a long time to track down and eventually see the film, I was so appalled i actually burst into tears when i did see it.

I understand that in the 80's films where a lot more censcored and maybe elaborating vital parts of the book (Cathy and Chris dealing with puberty/inscest etc.) but why the hell make a film about a book if your not going to do it properly? And why change the ending, why even use the name "Flowers in the Attic" when your just going to massacre everything that was good about the book, they should have called it. Seriously I don't know when Virginia Andrews died, but if she was still alive when this book was made I'm suprised she didnt sue the people that made it, and if she wasnt I hope she seeks revenge from beyond the grave.

Don't buy this film, buy the book, if you've already read the book this film will only dissapoint and anger you, unless of course your satisfied with watching a film a brain dead monkey could have made, actually I think a brain dead monkey would have made a better job.
