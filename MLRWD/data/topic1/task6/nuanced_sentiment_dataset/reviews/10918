I am a fan of some of Seagal's films, Above The Law, Under Siege, On Deadly Ground, Marked For Death. I attended an Ai Ki Jitsu seminar taught by him. I am a fan of Samurai films. I am especially fond of East-Meets-West, "sword porn," Yakuza [a magnum opus], The Hunted, The Challenge, Red Sun [a largely unrecognized masterpiece]. I am a student of Japanese martial arts, Nihon To and culture. That said, Into The Sun is a major disappointment. It is as if someone took all of the best images, worst clich&eacute;s and dull moments from the aforementioned films, all of Seagal's worst deadpan non-acting, and a large chunk of money, threw them into a cement mixer and this film fell out. It has a compelling plot concept, good cast, art direction, set and setting, all the elements, great potential, however, it has no soul, no elegance. The fight scenes are like watching Bo Derek's sex scenes, all the hardware is there, all the action, but it is still boring. As with most of Seagal's films it is burdened with an anti-government sub-message. In particular it suffers from inept direction and incoherent editing. It is like overcooked filet mignon, flat champagne or too old sushi. Rent it and watch it before you buy it. I shall be trying to sell my copy after one viewing.
