I'm sorry to say but the bootleg version I watched of this was  waaay better than this dvd version of the film.The bootleg wasnt mine haha but I watched it cuz my friend had it and I thought the film was hella tight.So I decided I'd buy it when it dropped on dvd.I just bought this dvd not even thinking they might re-edit it from the theater release and now I'm not sure if the bootleg I watched was the foreign cut or the US theater release cuz I never seen it in theaters so I wouldnt know.But I know that the little edits they did make on this dvd and certain scenes that were cut out and the fact I pretty much watched the better version enough times to notice the difference makes this dvd version WACK as hell.It had a whole different feel to the film overall.It is minor changes they made but they made a big difference.If this version were the one I'd seen first I wouldnt have wanted to buy it.Does anybody know the regular version I'm talking about and know where I can buy that? One little change to help you folks to know what version I'm talking about in case you have info on where to get it.In the first cut of this movie I watched,when Ting first gets to the city he meets his cousin "Dirty Ballz" and that was a funny scene but in this dvd version he only calls him "Humlae" and just killed the mood of that scene.So if yall know where to get the version I'm lookin for please reply.This movie isnt bad,just this version of it.Other than that this movie is the sh*t.
