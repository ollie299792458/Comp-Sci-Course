Regardless of what you might have heard, 1998's Godzilla is a pretty decent remake of the original.

I had seen the movie in its' original release and remembered having a negative opinion, but couldn't remember the details. I recently found the DVD on the cheap and decided to give it a second chance.

Watching the giant iguana Godzilla tear through rainy New York was a lot of fun. The CGI didn't bother me and Godzilla's new look wasn't bad. (Not as good as the Japanese one though!) I started to wonder why this movie didn't do better and if maybe I was too critical. Then about 90 minutes in, Dean and Roland lose track of the story (they are listed as contributors to the screen play, so I feel it's fair to blame them).

The movie suddenly stops focusing on Godzilla and switches to Madison Square Garden where a bunch of mini-Zillas hatch and chase the cast around. This drags on for a half an hour. Hank Azaria's part in the movie suddenly becomes too big and you realize that Steven Spielberg has directed a MUCH better version of this same set-up in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAT">Jurassic Park</a>. This movie starts to become waterlogged.

Once the main characters escape and Godzilla starts running around again, the movie picks up, but at that point my fiance and I were already yawning.

If you like the idea of big monsters stomping cities, I'd still recommend this one.
