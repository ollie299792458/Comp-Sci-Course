I first saw this movie a few years back, but I just recently purchased it. It has a pretty decent story and seems to be somewhat believable. I've never been to Brazil, but I have heard that kidnapping is somewhat common in the region. Its starts out with some Tourists who get stranded after their bus breaks down. They eventually make their way to a picture perfect spot on the beach, full of beautiful women, booze and the works. They are soon befriended by a local "Kiko" and then things get interesting. After a night of partying (and one lucky guy ;-) they wake up to find their gear and money all gone. A victim of dugs in their drinks, they decide to try and find help in a local village, but wind up getting into trouble with the locals. Chaos ensues and they find themselves being lead to "safe shelter" by Kiko their local friend or so they think... Once they arrive in their hidden paradise, things quickly go from care free to scare fest! Overall a decent flick. I just wish they would come out with a Blu Ray version of it!
