Did anyone denouncing the jealous rages of Tinker Bell, the petty antics of the mermaids or Peter's sometimes cruel spirit actually read the original book?  No?  I didn't think so.

What is left to say?  This movie is a Disney classic and holds a special place in the hearts of many adults.  However, the indirect racism and stereotypes may not be appropriate for todays audience and their parent's undue concerns with political correctness and empowering views of femininity.

The film is very dated, but no more than the other animated features from this time period.  The film also doesn't accurately reflect the original novel, but none of Disney's Classics hold very true to their inspirations.

This film is a beautiful example of light hearted entertainment of a bygone era.  The old Disney Classics are in a league all their own and modern children's movies just can't touch them.

If you are a parent concerned with the indirect racism and old fashioned views just look to the humor in today's children's films.  Sexual innuendo, toilet humor, political stabs, many of which go over the heads of the little ones.  What makes outdated stereotypes any worse than the derogatory humor used in today's CGI cinematography?

At least these older films are intelligent and encourage children to dream big and use their imaginations.

The Platinum Edition of Peter Pan is a must have for any Disney collection.  As your children get older show them the other adaptations, such as the live action and encourage them to read the book.  There's no reason not to challenge a child.  That's what these Classics did, they opened doors to other means of enjoyment and enrichment for children.  A lot of parents today really miss that point.
