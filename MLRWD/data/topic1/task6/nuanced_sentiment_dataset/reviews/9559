While I thought this was a good film, some scenes were hard to watch. Such as the beginning and ending parts, where Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) deflower two young underage girls, and where Casper (Justin Pierce) rapes Jenny (Chloe Sevigny) in her sleep. All Telly wants to do is de-virginize young girls. Jenny, one of Telly's previous sex partners, Jenny finds out she has an HIV, after only having sex once. She looks for Telly, only to catch him doing another girl, giving her an HIV. Jenny falls asleep, depressed, and Casper rapes her, giving him an HIV.

I am aware that the kids were only acting, but stuff like this actually happens in the world. Children as young as 10-12 doing drugs, underage sex, and receiving HIVs, and the parents don't do anything. This film was also very controversial, some claimed it "borerline child pornography". But this was a great film, even though I won't be watching it again for a while, because I was shocked from everything.

If you liked "Kids", you will like "Ken Park", which actually contains more explicit content than this one.
