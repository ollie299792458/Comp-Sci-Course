The movie is gripping. Heart racing and very real. Starts with Denzel Washington as an alcoholic surviving as a vagabond. He comes to a new chapter in his life when his friends get him a job of Security specialising in Child Protection ( As the rich kids were getting kidnapped in high numbers in Mexico)

What follows are chain of events that leave you gasping for more and hard fight for acclaiming your revenge from the bad , ugly mafia.
The twists and turns keep you guessing. The plot is powerful with emotions, characters, reactions and revenge (no crazy special effects) that make sure you consume your nails.

Good movie. Long but I wouldn't have minded it if it was longer.  Denzel Washington acted brilliantly and made sure he gets bigger fan following after this movie.

There is one song from the soundtrack that I have loved, it sounds similar to the title track of Gladiator but has its own nuances and loved whenever it was played in the background.
A complete thriller and wonderfully directed
I loved the movie and find it having re-run value.
