I am glad I chose to rent this movie.  You only need to watch it once.

I will try to be nice because I respect Andrew Breitbart and miss his presence greatly.  I also believe Occupy to be evil both in their goals and methods.

If you visit sites like Breitbart.com regularly, there is very little new here.  The protesters themselves are retarded, dirty, and violent.  The movement is a mixture of all things radical and left.  Media this, politicians that.

I learned a couple of new names about who was actually organizing this behind the scenes, but without more screen time and graphics to help visualize this organization, you get the impression that "And then this old sixties leftist sent emails, and then we got this guy on tape, and then these dudes just showed up."

There's a lot of footage that gets reused throughout the movie but it's hard to notice thanks to super-slick editing.  (Speaking of which: calm down, Bannon.)

If you don't watch Fox News or read conservative blogs, you may actually learn quite a bit.  But I think reasonable viewers would agree: this movie could have punched a lot harder, and not left the viewer feeling teased at every concrete opportunity to understand something.

I respect the people who wandered into the protests to make this movie.  That was dangerous.

There's lots of excellent footage of property destruction and violence with police, and for those reasons alone Occupiers may want to own this movie--just to masturbate to their highlight reels.

Bottom line: watch it once.  I hope you get more from it than I did.
