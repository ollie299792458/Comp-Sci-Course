This is a disappointment for director John Woo's (Face/Off,Broken Arrow) Hollywood film debut.John Woo does a great job at the directing helm, but Jean-Claude let's it down with his lack of acting skills, which is a pity because with a better actor this film could have been a lot better.The story involves Fouchon (Lance Henriksen) and Van Cleaf (Arnold Vosloo)who are two wealthy business men who recruit homeless men - mostly with a military background - to be hunted in New Orleans.Their clients pay millions for the pleasure of hunting.When Natasha Binder (Yancy Butler) goes to New Orleans in search of her missimg father she meets Chance Boudreaux (Jean-Claude Van Damme).With his help they discover her father was homeless and died in a fire accident.They later find out he had been brutally murdered.Boudreaux soon becomes too deep in Natasha's investigation and ends up getting involved with the deadly pair,Fouchon and Van Cleaf.This film is extremely predictable.The only thing that keeps you hanging on is the exciting action scenes.Good performances from Arnold Vosloo though.
