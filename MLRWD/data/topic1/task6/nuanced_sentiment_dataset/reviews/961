George Lucas is a petty child.

Nobody wants "weesa fwee."  No rational person would  replace Sebastian Shaw with Hayden Christianson.  And nobody wants Bobba Fett with a Kiwi accent. This is what we fight against and boycott.  The most poorly rendered computer creature ever conceived waiting for Han beneath the Falcon is not an improvement or an "enhancment," and certainly not a welcome or worthy addition to great films.

"It's just the original versions, as they were," Lucas said. "We didn't do anything to it at all. But we're not sure how many people want that."

"Now we'll find out whether they really wanted the original or whether they wanted the improved versions," he said. "It'll all come out in the end."

The original theater release would have been in at least 5.1 surround sound.  This DVD is only in stereo so that Lucas didn't have to spend any more money than it takes to burn a DVD directly off a laser disc.  People have been doing that for about a decade now and they have better cover art, extras, and a lower price.

We don't want improvements like replacing actors and the spoken rolls of others.  That is mindless meddling not improving.  We want a proper picture in widescreen and surround sound.  We want the kind of product one would expect from THX and Skywalker Sound.  This is the "Bedazzled" devil wish granting of DVD releases.  Even if George Lucas doesn't care about these Star Wars films there are those who do.  If Lucas is going to release a DVD appeasing, or testing the fans at least make it something worth buying.  The art on the box is infantile.  The "original trilogy" is packaged as bonus material with no extras to speak of.  We still have to buy yet another special edition version of the film.

We as fans are not looking to complain,  but we are continually given good reason.
