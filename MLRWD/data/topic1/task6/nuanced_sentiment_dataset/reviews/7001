After last year turned out to be the best year for movies in a long time, I've been disappointed this year as every movie I see seems sub par.  I went into 'Charlie's Angels' wanting only to see a little Bond-esque action and, of course, Lucy Liu.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the first movie this year I'd like to see again.  Rather than a simple street-fightin' flick, 'Charlie's Angels' actually had an interesting plot, and a script that never takes itself too seriously, to the advantage of the viewer.  Just when you think it might get too campy, you realize it's just a fun movie to watch and relax.
The script, as I said, is nicely done, but would have been unmemorable had the cast not been as good as it was.  Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore, and Cameron Diaz play their parts casually with a just enough realism so you don't get bored.  And the supporting cast is nothing if not complimentary to the film.  This film would have been less had not Bill Murry and Tim Curry done their part.  And it's good to see Murry still hasn't lossed his touch.
I look forward to watching 'Charlie's Angels' again.  It was light-hearted and just plain fun to watch.  The direction, acting, and writing were certainly worthy.  Who says a movie needs anything more?
