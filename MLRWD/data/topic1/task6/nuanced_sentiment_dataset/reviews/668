Warning to all purist. The DVD of the PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is not the triumph of preservation its advertised as being. First and most important to home theatre owners, the transfer is simply not in focus! Unlike in the  movie theatre you cant ask the projetionist to refocus the image.. you are  stuck with it. Secondly: if the "preservationists" found the best  pre-print material in the 1929 synchronized re-edit as described on the  liner notes, why in heavens name don't they present it as originally shown?  Pretending that it is the silent version by replacing the soundtrack may be  the loophole by which the film could be categorized as public domain but it  is inherently dishonest to present it as an example of "film  preservation". The original silent cut, the synch sound release and  the present (refocused) remaster would be much more apreciated service to  posterity. Look to other silent film transfers for guidence in image  quality limits.If the box indicates that the contents are a "SPECIAL  COLLECTOR'S EDITION"  and advertises "PRIME..35mm QUALITY"  one wishes it lived up to its promise.
