I had never heard of this film. Unfortunately that changed when it was touted by my mother-in-law. She literally said that it was "the best film ever made." While I am used to her hyperbole, I figured there must be something there. There isn't. The reviews I read were mostly very favorable, giving the impression of a real tight gem of a thriller. DO NOT BELIEVE THEM! The acting in this film is atrocious - people will say its good because its quiet and sincere - but all we get is a generalized feeling from the actors of "loneliness." The script is terrible. What appears to be a consciously quiet and sparse film is exposed by an old man who mutters one inane comment after the next adding nothing to the plot or character development. THIS MOVIE IS NOT SUSPENSEFUL! NOR IS IT FUNNY OR CLEVER OR ANYTHING! It portrays gays as sex crazed child molesters, and women as ultimately totally dependent on men. There is no redeeming quality of this film except that it is less than two hours and takes place on Lake Tahoe.
