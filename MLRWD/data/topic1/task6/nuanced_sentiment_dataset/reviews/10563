This film is the perfect counterpoint to Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West," which rewards the patient viewer with a slowly unfolding mythic tale that ends up transcending both the American and Spaghetti western genres.  Corbucci, as always, is an impatient director, beginning his film not with an interminable wait for a train, but with a simple image of a gunfighter hauling a coffin and saddle (most people forget that little detail) behind him through a muddy wasteland.  Enzo Barboni's exquisite camerawork and Luis Bacalov's witty score punctuates this frenetic, modest film.  If it weren't for the literally dozens of interchangeable villains (Corbucci has Major Jackson's cretins wear red scarves seemingly so Django and the audience can tell bystanders from bad guys), this probably wouldn't have been such an influential film in Europe.  But the extremity of the violence, combined with the comic-book style stunt-work and photography (John Woo points to Peckinpah as a major influence, but one has to wonder how many times he watched Corbucci, too!), is probably what made it such a phenomenon.  There's art to this movie--but an art diametrically opposed to Leone's works.  For whereas Leone is all suspense--a series of build-ups and crescendi, almost classical in their orientation, concluding with a final, overwhelmingly tense battle--Corbucci seems always in a hurry to get on to the *next* battle.  Men fall like ten-pins; bullets fly thick as a swarm of bees; and it's all over usually before any level of suspense ever begins to build.  Only the concluding scene, with the mysterious Django struggling to use his beloved's (?) cemetery cross as a desperate replacement for his mangled hands, gestures to anything more than the sum of the film's parts.  Great fun for those who don't mind a "Wild Bunch"-like bodycount to go with a whole lot of style but not a whole lot of substance.
