5-stars to the lads.  1-star to the Celtic Thunder management.  Average = 2.5-stars.

The Lads put on a Fantastic performance (as usual).  There are some truly amazing performances in this show.  The acappella pieces have become my favorite.  These guys harmonize soooo well together.

The down side is that this DVD is very poorly edited.  The audio is amateur quality at best, and often out of sync with the video.  Additionally, the "show" portion of the DVD is VERY short.  Part of the additional material at the end of the DVD, includes clips of songs and scenes which are not included in the show.  I can only assume that these scenes were edited out in preparation for a "second-half" to be released in the future.  If so, that's pretty cheap, and very disrespectful to the fans.  A number of 5-star reviews state that they were at the taping of the show, yet none of them address the fact that large portions of the show are inexplicably missing from the DVD.  That certainly makes me question the accuracy of the review.  I wish these very talented lads could find some equally talented management.
