Okay, so I lied! This set of DVDs is a perfect 5 out of 5, we're talking about Baretta here, the show was a classic!
So this is why I'm getting your attention, every episode is a fantastic walk down memory lane, the only draw back is that every episode begins and ends with the theme music minus the words! Can you imagine? it's like watching Baretta without any of HIS dialogue, but everyone else is all there! Some kind of cheap royalty battle must have gone on to have this classic series go out to the masses without the "eye on the sparrow" music with all the lyrics over the credits! Every time the music comes up, you get a slap in the face!
The only taste of the classic song was slipped into episode 4 "if you can't pay the price". Here we have Tony singing along to his car radio while it is playing Baretta's theme song... lyrics included!
Sure it's a small detail, but when you're expecting to get the actual first season of Baretta, that should include the theme music that accompanied the actual show... shouldn't it?
All I can say is that I truely hope they get this fixed for the second season DVD set.
