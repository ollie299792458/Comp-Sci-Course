This movie isn't terrible--there are some scenes that work quite well. It's certainly not bad enough for a one or two star rating, but I found it to definitely have it's problems.
1. I found many of the characters to be a little TOO over the top, all extremes of their stereotypes. Meredith played the role of the prudish, tight, ultra conservative, Amy is the messy quick witted liberal college student with a chip on her shoulder, and Sybil is the free thinking liberal mom who supports her children in whatever they do with little moral guidance. There's also the slacker stoner, but surprisingly introspective, brother, and the gay deaf brother in a biracial relationship.
2. There seems to be a major identity crisis in this movie. Rewatching the trailer just now, my belief is confirmed that this movie was advertised as a romantic COMEDY, but ends up missing the mark. So if that's what you are expecting--be ye warned. It seemed to try to be both a social commentary/drama and a romantic comedy. In the end, for this particular movie, I didn't find the two to balance out.
3. The underlying conflict between conservatism and liberalism is too exaggerated. While at first it seems to serve as a forum to put conservatives in their place, in the end, it's the liberals who get the wrist slap. The whole conflict ends up being too contrived and forced, and both sides seem to be the worst versions of themselves. I find the lack of tact and hospitality shown by the Stone family to be unrealistic and unfair.
4. Nothing against Claire Danes or the character of Meredith, but I hate how Meredith is used in the story. Her presence in every scene was just uncomfortable. She came there to give support to her sister, and throughout, did nothing of the sort, and didn't seem to make much attempt to do so.
5. This last one is just a bit of a pet peeve. I didn't find Rachel McAdams character quite as major as to be so high on the billing. Were they trying to coast on her previous successes?
