I will admit to not viewing this willingly:  My best friend is a rabid Tom Cruise fan, and insisted we rent it.  It wasn't bad, but could have used some changes or 'tweaking' to make it more interesting.
The use of technical elements was actually pretty cool.  I can actually envision some/most of these gadgets being in use in the not-so-distant future, and it was just cool to see a high tech movie not weighted down by the technese.  The personalized ads were also pretty cool as a plot device.  I did find the eyeball switching to be a bit contrived and a stretch to believe...but it didn't detract from the overall premise too much for me.
I do think that, had Spielberg's name not been attached to it, it probably would have registered a little lower on the overall critical scale.  One major problem with this movie is it could have benefitted largely from more editing:  you can lose 20 - 30 minutes of this movie and it would have flowed so much better!!!!
It got very draggy at certain points and, under a less-respected director/production team, critics would have made note of this.
This is a good movie, but bring your attention span.
