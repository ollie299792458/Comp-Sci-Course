After seeing "Escape from New York" on TV, I became a fan. I searched for it on DVD and found this Special Edition version. This release comes with a second disc with some extras, including an appoximate 10-minute clip that John Carpenter removed from the theatrical release. The clip shows what Snake Plissken did to get caught. The transfer quality of this footage is a little rough, but, by no means, would I consider it "unwatchable". Also included in this release is the first issue of "John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles", which is a four-issue comic book mini-series (being the fan that I am, I have already collected all four issues and must say the mini-series is just awesome).

All in all, if you are a big fan of "Escape from New York", I recommend this release. If you are buying this movie just to add it to your collection, and do not care about special features, then I would suggest just buying the "bare-bones" release (the one-disc release that just has the movie and nothing extra).
