Other reviewers have already waxed eloquent on the quality of the film itself, so I'll not retread their steps.  The film is one of the best "man movies" ever made, and should bring a smile to the face of anyone who gets a kick out of the "mission films" which inspired modern films such as Tarantino's "Inglourious Basterds."

I will caution buyers that there are copies of this Blu-ray in circulation which simply don't work:  my first copy wouldn't work in any of three players.  Additionally, the film doesn't look nearly as good as you've probably come to expect from a Blu-ray.  It's FAR superior to the DVD release (which I found unwatchable in spots), with rich textures and warm colors, but there is still quite a bit of grain in the film (though to be fair, this might not be a complaint for some viewers, as the grain does add some "grit" to the proceedings).

It's a 4-star film, but an imperfect Blu-ray transfer pulls the whole thing down to a 3-star purchase.  That said, the film still stands as a classic of the genre, and this is the best-looking version currently available.  At this low price, it's worth buying.
