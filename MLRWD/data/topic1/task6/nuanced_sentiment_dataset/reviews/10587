OK...lets get a few things straight people...Mila Kunis is NOT cute.  She doesn't hold "her own".  She is not funny or charming.  Her voice is like steel nails on chalkboard. She is NOT a good actor, I DON'T think seeing her naked in a shower scene would make the movie better, and I DO think that competing with some of the least talented actors in Hollywood (aka William Shatner, a man who is his own joke) she comes out flying colors ahead of everyone as the worst part of the movie.

Now, American Psycho 2 is NOT based on a book, it's writers DID NOT understand the original movie, and I WOULDN'T be shocked to learn that they never bothered to read the book. American Psycho 1 is NOT a slasher or horror film or book whatsoever..it's a social satire on the depravity and decadence of the rich. It pokes fun at the idea that these born to wealth are somehow better than us, Ellis (the actual writer of the book for the illiterate 12 year olds that like American Psycho 2) informs us that their position and wealth have caused such alienation in them that they are actually our moral inferiors, not the other way around. American Psycho 2 doesn't get this or doesn't care and tries to commercially bank on all the dumbasses that THOUGHT American Psycho 1 was a slasher film.

Thirdly, for anyone that READ the book we know that he DID actually kill those people, but that of course isn't the point, at least not literally.  It's a metaphor...like when he says "Murders and Executions" instead of "Mergers and Aquisitions"...it's what it really is behind the flashy clothes and authoritative legal speak.

American Psycho 2 lacks any subtext whatsoever and panders to the lowest common denominator...a false charge brought against the first movie. This is truly zero star quality.
