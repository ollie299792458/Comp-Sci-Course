"Night of the Living Dead 3D: 2D version" was, as a whole, not so bad.  But there were elements that left me a little disappointed with the product.  I did enjoy it, though.

The movie opens with clips from the opening scene of the original and also has sections of the movie where they are watching the original classic.  Whole scenes move forward with the original music and sounds from the original playing in the background.  I liked the idea, especially with the opening, but was a little miffed, as I knew George and the original cast and composer didn't see a dime of royalties.  I kind of felt like they took advantage of it.

The zombies were top notch, in my opinion.  A key element in my enjoyment of zombie movies (read: do they look good).  I thought some of the camera angles they chose gave some great scares and provided that bit of anticipation when you see a zombie shamble into frame, even from a distance.

The story was alright, but I wasn't expecting acadamy award winning writing, dialogue, or acting.  It was all pretty average, and a good story overall.

The female lead was alright, apart from her looking like a slow child running from the zombies.  Sid Haig delivers a great moment during a monologue later in the movie.  I have to say it was a great moment in the flick.  Very real and truthful.  I'm interested in seeing his other work now.

The ending was a huge letdown, and my only huge disappointment in the film.  Zombie stories should end with a bang, not a whimper.

The movie is the standard variation on a theme, and one I wouldn't be ashamed to have in my zombie movie library.  There are much worse out there.  It could have gone by another name, but would have only been put in the mix with the sea of zombie movies that are out there now.
