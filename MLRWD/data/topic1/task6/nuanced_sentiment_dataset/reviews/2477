In the end, there's somethign about this film that works. Ford and Neeson are surpringly good, and seem to have a chemistry that is at times perfectly tense. I'd even go so far to say that for the most part, Ford was acting so well I began to hate his character...which of course is his intent. That's saying a lot since I have a hard time buying him as a bad guy (What Lies Beneath was just abysmal). There is, of course, the hullabaloo about the accents. Are they bad? Yes. Ford's is at times too underdone, and at times way over the top. Neeson's is basically absent, and we get more Irish dialect than anything else. I get the feeling they needed a better voice coach...if they even used one. BUT! I found myself getting over it all after about fifteen minutes and following the story instead. It starts slow, but if you hang in there for about a half hour, the tension surfaces, and once it does it rarely lets up. There's genuine emotion and struggle when the reactor springs it leak, and the crew must enter the radiation filled room to fix it. It's just plain depressing and disturbing, and I completely identified wth the blistering men who suffered the effects. I bought Ford's concern over his crew while at the same time struggling with his allegiance to his homeland. I bought Neeson's love for his crew and disgust with Ford's reckless ways.  I routed for the men to escape...Russian men at that, who chose to moon the American Destoryer that was offering them assistance.  Naturally, there are some stretches that make you yawn, and there are some moments where you'll question the  truth of this supposedly True Story. The only major thing that annoyed me was the Hollywood-ized ending. It was unecessary and boring.
