So, I went and watched Spider-man 3 on a midnight show in Miami. I was so exited to see what the movie was going to look like and to my surprise the movie just fell off high expectations. There are so many problems with the movie I don't even know what to start with.

The movie is difficult to follow. It has so many characters that you get mixed up on which storyline you should follow. The writing wasn't so great either. The Scenes?? Well to tell you the truth, I can not take the good out of a movie just because it was bad, I would say the effect where amazing, clearly better than the ones before, but in the end, effects does not make a movie "good", there is not one scene that I would say "Wow, that was an amazing scene". I remember that in Spider-Man 2 the scene where Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson are in the coffee shop and Doc Ock throws a car at them, the picture becomes slow motion, Kristen barely touched the car-- there was nothing like this in the picture, nothing worth really watching for, none of the stories really had an end. Everything was just mixed all over the place.

I hope that if they plan on releasing Spider-man 4, they need to think about it, and if they are going to make it this long, please throw some action at us. I would say stick with the action-packed Spiderman, not with the "heart-broken" one. If you are a fan, see it just because you have seen Spider-man 1 and 2, but if you are new to this (which might be impossible) don't watch it, I'm telling you, you won't like what you see.
