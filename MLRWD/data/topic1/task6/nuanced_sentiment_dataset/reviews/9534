OK, Vexille is the latest in modern anime, of which I haven't watched for quite awhile.  Blending CGI and animation as is the popular trend nowadays, the film looks fantastic, and delivers some of the best looking anime I've seen. The suits of SWORD and their transport Helo, are amazing to gawk at.

The characters, being typical anime movie action types are familiar, and nothing new, however seeing them look this good almost makes up for it.  Plot is well, convoluted, in that Japan advances robotics to a level where they supersede humans and replace them...while keeping all of this a secret from the rest of the world. I  know it's anime but perhaps the CGI "realness" look jarred me with it's typical anime story.

I wanted to like this more than I do, but for some reason I just couldn't 5 star it.  It has all the right looks, the right sounds(I only watched in Japanese, I normally hate english dubbed anime), the right action in an action anime; the story actually picked up a bit after the initial infiltration, but the finale left me a bit underwhelmed as it was quite predictable.  All in all, not a bad effort, but not a great one. Worth seeing though.
