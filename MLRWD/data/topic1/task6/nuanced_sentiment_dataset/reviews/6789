This was an unexpected hit in my household!  
Disclaimer:  This movie is NOT for everyone.  There is a certain level of crude humor, sarcasm, negativity, and irreverence about the whole thing, but if you can relate to the subject matter, that is precisely what makes it a GEM.
Having worked for the real-life equivalent of this movie's evil corporate conglomerate, I was able to relate to this movie in a particularly strong way, which made it a much-needed outlet for me.  From the humorous depictions of corporate "motivation" attempts, to the "evil boss" who tortures the main characters (even in their dreams), to the sudden lay-offs that send them over the edge, this movie is tailor-made for the white collar working stiffs who live it every day (especially anyone in a technical/computer/programming field).
If you have experienced the forest of gray cubicle walls, the droning, boring corporate meetings, the logic-lacking company policies, the inhuman treatment from management, you will LOVE this movie.  It will serve as an anchor for you to see that you aren't the only one who sees the BS for what it is, and I must say it is a refreshing feeling!  
If you fit the profile, the smallest detail of this movie will cause you to burst into tear-producing laughter.  If not, you might want to give it a try, but proceed with caution. :)
