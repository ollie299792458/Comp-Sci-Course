Despite the hokey storyline of two brothers locked in enmity working for the same firehouse company, this movie is worth watching for the excellent fire scenes.  But cadet firefighters beware: this movie is NOT NFPA APPROVED.  The firefighters in this movie scorn protective gear, spurn self-contained breathing apparatus, and breach 100 other firefighting regs all in the name of maverick machismo.  And the hero plies the heroine with his, er, hose atop the hoses on an Engine.  Definitely not usage as per regulations and would earn a severe reprimand.  After all, it results in a life threatening delay in deploying the 2-1/2 inch while a brassiere is untangled from it.  A funny part to watch for is the catchphrase 'It's in the walls!' as smoke gets mysteriously sucked back I suppose into the walls leaving the structure unblackened and unscorched, just as if the video had been reversed.  Oh yeah, duh.  Anyway, great cameos by grouchy investigator De Niro and twisted arsonist Sutherland.  Watch it, enjoy it, suspend disbelief during it.  The first rescue scene for example.  Even wearing bunker gloves a firefighter should take that pronounced a degree of rigor mortis as clear evidence of what is technically referred to in the trade as "dead".
