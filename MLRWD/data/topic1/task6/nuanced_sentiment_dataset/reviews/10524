Firstly let me say that I disagree with Hollywood making movies and money out of what happened at 9/11. To me its human nature at its worst.

Sure we need to always remember what happened, never forget the thousands who lost their lives and the hundreds who courageously strived to save others. But this we can do in the many documentaries created, did we really need this film. I for one will never forget the televised scenes as the news broke on that fateful day.

The movie is simply poor. It focuses on 2 policemen who were trapped underground, and the stress and tension they and their families all went through.

I believe the film was made in a rush to get it to market quickly. The choice of just 2 nypd families (37 died) to focus on is a poor choice considering the heroism of the NY fire department (343 died) that day.

The film misses out in so many ways, such as not showing the planes, very limited view of the collapse of the towers.

Its hard to make a movie on such a subject, and easy for a reviewer like me to criticise, but the film reminded me of the Poisiden adventure.

Its a poor film that does not succeed in what it sets out to do in showing the courage, bravery and sacrifice of the many hundreds of men and woman who ventured into towers 1 and 2 of the world trade centre while everyone else was trying to get out.
