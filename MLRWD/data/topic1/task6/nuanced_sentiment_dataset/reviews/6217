This dvd is indeed edited. Where are the mouseketeers? On the original program Dateline Disneyland they were shown marching in the parade and they did their own special musical number and roll call. You won't see them here.Folks, this is NOT the entire program that was shown nation wide on television in July, 1955. Disney only wants you to see what they want you to see. Could this be revisionist history? Disney,if Walt wanted them to be included in the original 1955 program,who are you to take out what your founder originally wanted? If you're going to edit out things that Walt approved or had no problems with, then don't call yourself "The Walt Disney Company" anymore. Since his name is a part of the company name, then his values should always be there and nothing should ever be edited out that he approved of. Otherwise, you're truly not "The WALT DISNEY Company"! ALWAYS do things the way Walt would have done them or no longer call yourself "The WALT DISNEY Company". In a way, to be "The Walt Disney Company" you need to be the man himself.
