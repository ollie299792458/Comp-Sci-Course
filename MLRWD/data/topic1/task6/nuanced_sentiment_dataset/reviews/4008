I have to agree with everyone's bad reviews on the exercises and trainers.  It is hard to look at the screen during some of the exercises to get the timing down... the trainers are obnoxious... etc.

But the nutrition section is even worse!  I was hoping to get some recipe ideas, but the recipes are all written using British English and British measurements!  How should I know how high to put the oven on when it tells me gas 5, gas mark 3, or gives the temperature in Celsius?  The ingredients and instructions are also in British English, so without using the internet to translate you can't even follow most of them.  If you view the credits, you will see that it was produced in the UK.

We contacted UbiSoft, and they looked at their disk and the recipes were the same for them, so it is not like there is another version.  The game was only tested in the UK, not in the US.  We asked about a patch and were told that most people who use this type of a game do not have their Wii online (we don't), so there was probably nothing they could do, though it will be brought up to management.  The game should not have been distributed without testing.  The tech guy was puzzled by this but offered no solution.

This was not a satisfactory response, in my opinion.  A refund or replacement offer would have been nice, instead of just "oops".  No more UbiSoft games for us!  --Laura
