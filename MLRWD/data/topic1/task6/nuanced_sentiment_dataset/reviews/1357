Do not under any circumstances purchase this blu-ray DVD.  Decorum prevents me from using certain unsavory verbage to accurately describe this item but I will try all the same.  Let me put it this way: If you accidentally dropped this DVD on your lawn, flowers would grow there because this DVD is crap.

Let's just put aside the fact that Fox opted not to include any of the extras from the regular DVD release from a few years ago.  Knowing this going in, I bought it anyway thinking that the superior video and audio quality alone would justify the purchase.  Nope.  The picture is appalingly bad.  Fox didn't even bother to clean the print up for the transfer, so all the dust particles and artifacts from the print can now be seen in High Def.  Bravo, Fox.

What's more, Fox is commanding top dollar for this P.O.S.  Suggested retail price is $29.95, a price range reserved for the higher end blu-ray DVD's with superior quality and gobs of extras.  It's barely worth $9.99 and that's being generous.

Avoid this one like the plague.  If someone gives you this DVD, use it as a coaster because it isn't good for much else.  Maybe target practice.  Don't buy COMMANDO either, that one sucks too.

If Fox messes up FIGHT CLUB this badly, I will be royally pissed.  Right now I'm just annoyed.  You are on probabtion, Fox.  Get on the ball or get out of the game.
