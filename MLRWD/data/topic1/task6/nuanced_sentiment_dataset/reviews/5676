To be fair, this movie has been the object of so much hype, it may be obvious that it could only fall short of it.

My problem is that it not only fell short of the hype, but it actually never came even remotely close.

The characters were completely unreal.  Having characters swear a lot does not make them real, no matter what the hype machine says.  It's a trite attempt at hiding any lack of understanding of the characters.

But even worse was the way the film was made.  The diretor, Mr. Sollett, made absolutely no attempt at using the tools of filmmaking, opting instead to bathe the entire movie in an annoying reddish light that never changed and to shake the camera constantly for an hour and a half.

My guess is he did it so he could hype his movie as "documentary-style" or some such.  Well, Mr. Sollett, this isn't documentary-style, it's just imcompetent and only serves to highlight the complete fakeness of the whole film, which was designed to superficially appear "real" (which apparently impressed the critics who are always ready and willing to applaud incompetence as art) while eschewing any attempt at true characters and actual filmmaking.

A complete fraud that sadly has bamboozeled a few.
