"Alien 3" is an exciting, scary, sci-fi film with fantastic, gothic art direction and, dare-I-say, beautiful photography. As such, it's a great film in its own right, on par with its visionary predecessors, "Alien" and "Aliens." 
Oddly, "Alien 3" only suffers criticism due to its relationship to those earlier films. Here's how: In "Alien 3," director David Fincher tries to unencumber the saga from the baggage of the first two films, where the story arcs of favorite characters Ripley, Hicks, Bishop, and Newt had already come to complete resolution, with each character saved. By dismissing (read that: killing off) all but Ripley so as to get on with a new story, Fincher, to fans, had negated the victory that was "Aliens." Most of the criticism of "Alien 3" stems from this.
Taken on its own, however, "Alien 3" is an entertaining film with impeccable production value, a tight storyline, great performances, plenty of scares, and more replay value that any other film in the franchise.
