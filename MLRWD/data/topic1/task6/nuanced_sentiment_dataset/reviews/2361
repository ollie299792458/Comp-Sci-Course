No amount of visual artistry could overcome the ludicrous dialogue, poor casting and jarring score of this disaster.  Aside from a few special effects, the movie is a complete and utter waste of time. 
Let's start with the acting.  Connie Nielsen's performance during Tim Robbin's death scene was perhaps the most painful two minutes of overacting in years. Barely 3 minutes later, she seems to have forgotten that her husband has turned himself into a popsicle. She shows no trace of sadness or emotional trauma.  Then, there's Don Cheadle.  Marooned for a year after watching his friends die, he's a nutcase.  But he pulls off his comical bushman wig and facial hair and returns to sanity without skipping a beat.
The score is a mess, never in sync with the action on the screen and lurching from one musical genre to another with no attempt to weave a coherent whole.  From grinding organ tones in one scene (that never reappear, thankfully) to sweeping strings (where silence would have been better), Morricone seemingly cut and pasted leftovers from previous films and hoped no one would notice.  
This movie deserved every bit of nasty criticism it originally received, and then some.
