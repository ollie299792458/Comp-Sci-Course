The other reviewers have described the plot so I'll skip that. Having studied ballet and many other types of dance myself since childhood, I can recognize and appreciate outstanding dancing. I would have to say this is my favorite dance movie, not just for the dancing, which is outstanding, but the whole "package". And you don't have to be a dancer to enjoy this film, since it's so well done and entertaining (unlike "The Company", a movie about a ballet company that I found tedious to watch, even though I studied ballet many years and it had beautiful dancing). This film has really outstanding dancing from Paul Mercurio and Antonio Vargas, the 2 professional dancers in the film. Just to see Paul Mercurio dance is worth watching the movie for (and what a body!). I can tell that he was trained in classical ballet since no one can move like that who was not. But he also brings a wonderful, smoldering sensuality to the screen in the love story. The love story is very touching, the performance of Tara Morice in the ugly duckling to swan role is outstanding and she dances remarkably well for a non-dancer. And then there is the satire of the competitive ballroom dancing world throughout the movie--it reminds me of the movie Best in Show satirizing the dog show world--and it's just as hilarious. Somehow all these elements--dancing, fairy tale story, satire, got mixed together perfectly to make an outstanding movie. The only part I didn't like was the cartoon-y explanation of Scott's father's career, but as the director explains, they had to do it that way due to the low budget. The finale dance (with Paul Mercurio & Tara Morice) is so exciting and well done it just gives me chills and it's also hilarious because the comedy is interspersed throughout it (happening on the sidelines).

The director's commentary on the DVD is pretty crappy and there are few special features but it's still worth getting the DVD to get the outstanding picture, color and sound quality.
