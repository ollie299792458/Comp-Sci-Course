Ok here is what I have to say about children of the corn its not a nice story, gothic children slaughter people becuase of their religion, a man and his wife or going to that same town that  the corn children took over, 3 years have passed since murders in the coffee shop and around the city of Gatlin, victims were apparently mutilated, they killed their parents, and destroyed eachothers families. The man stops the car to find that a boy's destroyed corpse lays in the highway, which was surrounded by cornfields. they enter the city where the nightmare begins, no population, nobody else's car drove nobody walking across the street, as silent as a ghost town. Then they find 2 survivors, a little girl and a boy, nothing else! then there was a gang children armed with blades, machettes, scythes, knives, too bad there was no police, there seems to be no laws in Gatlin, now that they are changed by insane children. Compared to village of the damned this story was more messed up then those villager kids !
