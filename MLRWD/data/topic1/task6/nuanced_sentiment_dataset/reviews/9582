There seems to be nothing more terrifying to Sydney Bristow than waking up two years after she closed her eyes to find her world upside down: her squeeze married to another, a mysterious scar on her lower stomach, and two years of her life as material as a fairytale. As the season two closer, Bristow (played by Jennifer Garner) has woken up in a Hong Kong backdrop without any incilination of what has happened with her life.
The first episode holds the typical first episode feel: what has happened, and how can we fix it. Sydney finds herself strangely alone in a world she once found solace in. But as the script takes a turn for the worse, after a single day of going back to the CIA, she delivers a powerhouse monologue to her past love, Vaughn. I'm not sure if Michael Vartan is still the actor he once was in previous seasons, or maybe personal effects of his real-life relationship with Garner have surfaced onto the silver screen.
As the season progresses, and Syndey finds herself deeply entangled in the web of what has happened with her life, after waking up "like it was just one night", she finds herself fighting foes just as desperate as she to recover her memory, dealing with the day-to-day of working with Vaughn and his NSC wife, Lauren (well played by Melissa George), and finding how the terrorist organization of the season is getting so close to her life and her work.
Episodes that keep the ALIAS promise and remind one of the past two amazing seasons: Episodes 2-7, which draw their power from the state both Sydney and the viewer is in, mass confusion; Episode 9, a beautifully shot episode full of twists, turns, amazing sets and effects as Sydney goes throw an attempt to regain her memory by hypnosis; and Episode 22, the finale that holds more excitement than most, answering questions and asking new ones.
As ALIAS progresses, the seasons get less memorable with hard scripts and forced emotions, but this season  a lot of emotional sympathy
