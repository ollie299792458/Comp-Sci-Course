Some spoilers ahead.....  Despite the starry casting (one can still feel the PR machine swinging into place for McConaughey), this film is a total eyeroller when it comes to anything approaching realism.  I've tried to wipe the entire thing out of my mind, but my memory still shudders at the recollection of Ashley Judd (nothing against Judd, but the bleached blonde hair immediately signals she's gonna be the misunderstanding, shrewish wife), and Bullock and McConaughey (sure, he's a solo practitioner who says "no thanks" when a briliant Law Review student/editor who can quote every capital punishment citation off the top of her head shows up to work for free (that's qualification for disbarment right there).  Or that despite the fact that crosses are being burned on their front lawns, their staff and staff family threatened and/or essentially killed, etc etc etc., both of the lead characters are perfectly comfortable with driving around in convertibles, leaving down the tops all of the time.  Spacey does his usual smarmy things; it might have been a lot more interesting if he and Matthew had traded roles.  Samuel L. Jackson gets to sweat a lot.  The Film is a total eye-roller from start to finish.  P.S.  I didn't want Matt's dog to die, but when the dog shows up alive, it totally bucks any convictions the film might have had - Matt's character doesn't move anywhere emotionally the entire film thanks to the script.
