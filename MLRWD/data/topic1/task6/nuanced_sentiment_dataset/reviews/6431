I am a huge Star Trek fan who has enjoyed among many Trek films, STAR TREK II and FIRST CONTACT, but this film, INSURRECTION, is an embarrasing entry in the series. It is to the Next Generation what William Shatner's STAR TREK V was to the original cast. A lightweight, inconsequential, New Age film which has the worst elements of LOST HORIZONS and THE SOUND OF MUSIC thrown in. Add to that embarrasing humor (breast jokes, Picard doing the mambo, Worf singing 'Gilbert and Sullivan,' wart jokes etc) plus brief and shoddily edited battle space battle sequences (with Ryker using a joystick to manouver the Enterprise (!), villains in bad need of plastic surgery, and overall, hom hum special effects, with a painfully hard to watch Data subplot about him trying to understand what its like to be human, and you've got a film that makes STAR TREK GENERATIONS look like CITIZEN KANE. When will the madness end? Please someone fire Rick Berman and bring back Nick Meyer or Leonard Nimoy to salvage the Trek movie franchise. At least they knew how to frame, shoot, and edit films, utilizing the widescreen format to its limit - the original cast movies did not look like made for tv movies that were shot in Northern California, like INSURRECTION does. This travesty of a Trek film ("lock and load") unsurprisingly, was the second lowest grossing Star Trek film (after ST V). It is a film even a fan can only watch once.
