I saw a early screening of Joy Ride and I have to say that this movie is made in the vein of the 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' flicks. After all, they are pursued by a psychotic truck driver who they had a played a prank on. Honestly, I didn't think this is the best horror flick I have ever seen. But it warrants to be a must see if you are looking for a decent horror flick. As for the script, at points you can infer that something is going to happen, and it does. It is not to say the whole movie is predictable, because there are some scary moments in this movie. As for the acting, at first, Steve Zahn seemed kind of irritating, and definitely like the irresponsible character that he was to play. But it seemed like characters he plays in his other movies seem similar. Paul Walker's performance of playing the straight coursed brother of Zahn's character seems to be well done, but his character seemed to be somewhat of a pushover in that he kept doing the dumb things that his brother wanted him to do. You would think that he would have the power to keep his brother in check, and avoid the horror that the pranks caused. As for Leelee Sobieski's character, she seemed all too subdued and calm that there was some type of stalker was on the three of their backs. As for the scenes, there is a weird unnecessary nudity scene when the prank goes sour, which seemed quite corny and dumb to put in. Overall, despite my badgerings of the film, the flick still has enough thrills and chills to warrant seeing. But be warned: expect to see some of the same setups of other horror flicks.
