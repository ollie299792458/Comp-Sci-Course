I've always been a bit of a Gene Hackman fan so I picked up this movie since it had been mentioned in other movie reviews. It contains a very young Melanie Griffith and a very young James Woods in the cast. At first the movie revolves around trying to find the Griffith character and return her to her home. However a series of rather weird characters and events turn the movie into a bit of a far-fetched mystery. There is also a backdrop of Hackmans wife cheating on him and he does a little cheating himself. The interactions between Hackman and the man his wife is cheating on him with are rather unrealistic, I assume this backdrop is intended to give Hackman an excuse to be drawn into a little cheating himself. The ending is anti-climatic, abrubt, and far-fetched. The production and directing is competent, as is the acting by most of the cast. In one scene, Hackman drives away from a family erupted into a huge arguement on their driveway. The scene is particularly ridiculous, but then again quite realistic. Hackman does a great job of conveying the absurdity of what the audience is witnessing.

If you like Gene Hackman, this DVD is worth adding to your collection. Although the story and situations within are pretty far outside the bounds of realistic and the plot will sometimes leave your head spinning, it's worth a view. By the way, Night Moves is supposed to refer to a chess sequence that is discussed in the movie, so it might be more aptly titled Knight Moves.
