...I'll give it three stars.  Okay, let's see how many different issues this movie can address at once: 1. Alcoholism 2. Spousal Abuse 3. Dysfunctional Relationships 4. Morality 5. School Violence... and there's more, but that'd give away the plot (even though I'm sure it's already been given away).  And so you have all these horrible issues clouded up in Haley's character's life, and yet he still tries to make a difference in the world.  It's your classic "tear-jerking-feel-good" movie, and almost everything in this has been cliched.  What I guess would make up for the kind of out-there storyline is the acting- Kevin Spacey's extreme talent really shines as his character.  He does an excellent job of switching from a teacher to a guy with really no life.  Helen Hunt, though I kind of have mixed feelings about her, does a very good protrayl of an abused spouse and alcoholic.  Haley Joel Osment's done better, but, he still does a decent job.  This movie is probably a bit darker than what you're expecting from the trailer, and I really wouldn't recommend it for people under 13.  I'm sure if you're not as nit-picky as I am you'll thoroughly enjoy this.
