If your eyes are not open already, the portrayals in this Disney movie are highly stereotypical and misguided. In this film some Indians are shown as acting like stupid, cartoonish, warlike primitives.

There is a song in the film that is offensive called "What Makes The Red Man Red?". Here are it's lyrics:

"Once the Injun didn't know/ all the things that he know now / But the Injun he sure learn a lot/ And it's all from asking "How" What made the red man red/ Let's go back a million years/ to the very first Indian Prince He kiss a maid and start to blush/ and we've all been blushin' since."

The author of Peter Pan, Mr Barrie, has also been criticized for his treatment of female characters.  Most of the female characters: Wendy, Tinker Bell, Tiger Lily, and the mermaids try to gain immature Peter Pan's affections; and Tinker Bell makes several attempts on Wendy's life out of jealousy, yet Peter shows no empathy and ignores all of their affections with indifference.

Would you like children to watch and learn from this on how to understand Indians? Would boys watching this be helped to learn how to grow up to be mature men, and have happy relations with mature women?  Would girls learn from watching this that its okay to try and have a boyfriend like an emotionally unavailable Peter Pan?
