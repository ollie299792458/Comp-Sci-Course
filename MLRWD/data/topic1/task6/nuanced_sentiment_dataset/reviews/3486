The first movie in my experience that I wasn't allowed to not like. Kevin Costner is incredibly vacuous in this tedious western epic. Yes it is visually stunning, yes the score is beautiful,(except the ridiculous  electronic dance sequence). This movie has a message though and it is  perfectly willing to hit you over the head with it. White people are  sweaty, wear dirty clothes, are immoral, incontinent, foul mouthed.  Indians, at least the Sioux Indians are clean, laundered, chaste, pure of  heart and speech. There are bad Indians but they are not Sioux, they are  Nazi's with feathers and loin cloths. When a white man decides to convert  to an Indian, he gets to have his hair blow dried and all his dirty clothes  laundered, he gets to have a serene attitude, he gets to have a fetching  young white woman who is also spotlessly clean because she has turned  Indian too. When we are all clean and pure we get new names.  The whole  thing is so manipulative and transparently racist I don't understand why so  many people fell for it. Buy the soundtrack and try to put these images out  of your mind.
