The movie Coach Carter is a powerful but yet emotional movie, it is also heart wrenching and inspirational. There are so many aspects that are enjoyable, exciting and meaningful. I felt that the movie's storyline was very important, as it was a message and moral sent out to not only teenagers and sportspeople, but I felt it was sending out a message to adults as well. I also felt that the music used was very upbeat and new age and well suited to the movie. Personally I though that it was one of the greatest movie's I have ever seen and I enjoyed just about everything in this movie.

Coach Carter is based on a true story. A heart warming story about a coach who cared and dared to make a difference in the lives of kids that had little or no future; he basically gave them a chance for a better life. It is about an ex-student at Richmond high school, Ken Carter, who offers to coach the school's basket ball team in hope of turning it around. He is trying to improve the player's games as well as their lives. Throughout the movie the team faces many ups and downs, learns many lessons and also realises the importance of everything Coach Ken Carter teaches them. One of the biggest things the team gains is working together as a team and having team spirit. In the end the team never gives up and realises that they have made their lives so much better. They also achieved something that is much more than winning.

The message in this movie mainly aimed towards teenagers. It emphasises that education is the first step on the path to a great sports star or athlete and that it is possible for students who are raised in the poor neighbourhoods to escape from that type of lifestyle. It is also a message of the importance of education and that school should always come first before sports. The general moral is that you have to put effort in to achieve and to grow an understanding of what students or anyone are really capable of. It is a positive message and includes good intentions.
