Ok, so, normally, this film would have only gotten 2.5 stars out of me, BUT, when compared to most of the other films in this tragically bad series (that deceptively billed itself as "too intense for wide release"), it really stands out as one of the better releases. Sadly, it suffers from what I like to call HOHH Disease. For those unfamiliar with HOHH Disease, or House on Haunted Hill Disease, it's an affliction in which a film with great promise for creepiness, chills and thrills displayed in the first half, dissolves into a completely scareless and overblown CGI mess in the second. So if you don't mind having your horror dreams crushed in the second act, this film is worth a viewing. Now, to address another reviewer who called Penny Dreadful a "semi-classic", all I have to say it let the name speak for itself. There wasn't an original, uncliched moment in the entire film. It's only distinguishing feature is that about 65 minutes of the 80 some odd minutes of the film takes place inside a car that's wedged between two trees. And no, I'm not kidding. I spent the majority of the film giggling at the dialogue, rolling my eyes, sighing loudly in boredom, looking around the theatre to watch other viewers' reactions (all of whom looked either completely amused, bored, annoyed, or somehow all three at once), and staring at my watch. As a horror film, it was a failure of tragic proportions. But as a SPOOF of a horror film, its an absolutely peerless laugh riot.
