This movie is awesome.  Story line is funny, but not in a Jerry Seinfeld way- it's more sophisticated in nature.  A superb love story between a soon-to-be-married girl, who's also scoring her ex-bf when the wedding procedure is going on, with a US returned handsome young man.  They had their respect for this arranged marriage, and the groom decided he'll continue with the marriage even though he gets quite upset knowing that the bride still had relationship with her ex.  When he bursts into emotions, she bursts into cry- perfect indian emotional outburst that leads the guy to let go all wrong of her soon-to-be bride.  There is also a love thingie going on between the maid and the wedding planner- a very touchy poor class love story.  There's also mention of a paedophile, which definitely is the reason why it was rated R, apart from some sexual situations.  With traditional hindi wedding songs, and some western-minded views, this movie is definitely a milestone in indian film making.  Thanks to Mira Nair, people from all over the world came to know about modern Indians once again.  Recommended: Asoka (Quite like BraveHeart of India), DevDas (great emotional lovestory based on a Bengali classic novel), Salam Bombay (another movie by Mira Nair) and finally Maya Memsahib.
