I saw this film probably once or twice as a youngster, but recently saw it again, seeing as I just bought the Sony DVD. Although it's uncut, re-mastered, and in Japanese, thank God, it is hopelessly devoid of any real special features. Any who, I'm here to elaborate on what is considered one of the worst G-films. I'll say right off the bat in my humble opinion you could do a lot worse, with the terribly unoriginal monsters of "Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster" or the atrocious Musuko Goji suit of "Son of Godzilla".

The battles in this movie are particularly entertaining, but once again it is deterred y awful amounts of pathetic stock footage. Alas, it is up to Gigan to save this aspect of the film, which I believe he does. Gigan draws blood from both Godzilla and Anguirus giving the fight a true sense of brutality that was just plain awesome!For this in itself, along with the good choice of Ifukube themes, I highly enjoy the film. While still a dip in Godzilla's career, this piece is an intriguing, sometimes unintentionally funny, and enjoyable film that I recommend to G-fans.
