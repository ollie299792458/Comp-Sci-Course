La ciudad is a movie which portrays the lives of immigrants in New York City. The movie starts with people taking their pictures at a photo shop, showing them at that moment and then when the camera clicks it zooms in to their lives. The first was a man that got a job for the day after getting picked up by a man that promised him and others 50 dollars for the day but when they got to the job site they were actually gonna get paid less and they had no choice but to take it because they needed the money. But it cost Jose more than he thought. The second is a man, Francisco, that arrives to New York and being lost wanders into a party. At the party, he is wowed by a girl named Maria and later finds out that she is from the same town where he is from. Later, Francisco finds himself lost in a city where everything looks the same to him. The next is of a man and his daughter who are homeless and live in their car. When the man tries to enroll his daughter in school they do not allow him because he does not have a rent or telephone receipt. The last is the story of a woman that works in a sweatshop that has not payed her for four weeks. After a call from her mother, she finds out that her 6 year old daughter is sick; and she must send money in order to pay for the hospital. The movie is beautifully directed because as a viewer you feel as if you are the character and you feel their pain. The movie is in Black and white which helps set the mood of the movie as somber; and it shows how not everything is in color, it shows the other side of the city which we never get to see.
