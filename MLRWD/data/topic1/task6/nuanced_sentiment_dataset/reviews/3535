I first saw this film in my teens, and it's stayed in my head ever since.  I've only been able to find it on DVD with Korean menus, but I thank goodness for the widescreen version!

To the classical western lover, this movie offers the dialogue and characters, but will disappoint with its lack of evil cattle barons, bank robbing villains, etc. but to the avid movie watcher, this is a real treat.  It's dark, real dark.  Alot of it is studio work, but even the exterior shooting is dim and really, though possibly inadvertently, the film is film-noire.

Bronson's dead-pan delivery fits right in here (I'd have hated to see him in a romantic comedy!)  Will Sampson has never disappointed me, even in such disastrous vehicles as Poltergeist III, but in his role as Crazy Horse (Worm) he is simply perfect (Hoka hai!)  All of the supporting casting was perfect as well.

The "Moby Dick" parallel is accurate....except we have the added complexity of two Ahab's, who should be enemies, but find themselves united.  Probably my favorite western!
