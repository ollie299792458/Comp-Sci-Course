As others have said this movie is indeed about family values, the price(s) one pays for winning and competition and dealing with devloping your child. Let us take all that as given - there are two other things that, to my mind are the core bedrock and are usually not mentioned in the review. But are in fact central in the script and the message.

The first is seeing beneath the surface of Chess to the emotional and intellectual endeavor it can be, at it's best. As Bruce Pandolfini puts it "Fischer got beneath the surface of the game line no one else before him". One doesn't need to understand chess, though it helps, to see that the passionate pursuit of great art is a moment of excellence.

The second is the prices necessary - which differ for us all. So few of us are truly excellent at much of anything, which is probably the reason we applaud those who are. Being able to create great art is a moment of transcendence and the movie shows us the exterior of this about as well as it can be done. But it also shows us how the single-minded pursuit of pure excellence at the price of all the other things that make us worthwhile people is a high price to pay.

It is these othere lessons that are at the heart of this movie and make it truly worthwhile as a great, long-lasting 'see-again' movie. For the whole family.
