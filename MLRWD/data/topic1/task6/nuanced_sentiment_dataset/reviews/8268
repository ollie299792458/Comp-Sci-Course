Leonard Nemoy's Star Trek directorial debut succeeds in two vital areas:  A)It's extremely well-paced and B)There's quite a bit of good humor in it.  The story takes place right after Khan's wrath and involves Kirk's starship-jacking of the Enterprise to go look for Spock's body to unite with his mind which in imprinted in McCoy's cranium.  The problem is Spock's body landed on the newly created and recently doomed planet of Genesis.  As luck would have it, a group of ambitious Klingons, led by Christopher Lloyd, want the information to make their own Genesis and go after the research vessel, which is inhabited by Kirk's son and the newly made-over Lt. Saavik, orbiting the planet for the information.

This is just good ol' fashioned Star Trek minus great space battles of the last installment.  Lloyd makes an admirable and funny adversary, surprisingly almost as good as Ricardo Montalban's Khan but not as memorable.  That's probably how you could sum up all of 'The Search for Spock': almost as good as Khan, but not as memorable.
