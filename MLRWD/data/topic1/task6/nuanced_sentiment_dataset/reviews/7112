At least we can cherish the first 4 films of this too bad dying series. I have been a fan of hellraiser and the Mythos since i was 12 and 10 yrs later i would have never thought the series to come to this. This film is no differ from Inferno, just a differ cast. This reminds me of a extremely bad X-files episode. The cenobites, if that's what you call them. The showing of them was so quick, hell it could have been Pamela Anderson and Howard Stern in Patent Leather Bondage Suits.
As for Pinhead he lost all his edge with these last two installments. He is no longer the Prince of flesh, pleasure, and pain who would tear your soul apart. He is the Dr. Do Good saying, "Well it's O.K. this time, but next time i'll have to tear you apart" or "Let's make a deal. 5 souls for your soul" . In since he is like the Grinch. His heart grew 5 times too much and that's alot when you didn't have one.
There was only one good scene and guess what???They cut it out. It gave more background on the Lament Configuration. They thought we didn't care about the Mythos..Hellraiser is Mythos.
Either bring back the old days or shelf the series and never compare this to the first film or the next three.
