Be cautious about Warner Brothers movies that include a digital copy -- they EXPIRE quickly, and it is not obvious on the packaging. I had purchased Inception from Target on June 12, 2011 for $29.99. When I attempted to redeem the digital copy, I found it had expired on May 6, 2011 -- over a month before I had purchased it. I contacted Warner Brothers about what had happened, and the representative told me there was nothing I could do because they adequately posted the expiration date on the DVD insert, the redemption Web site, and on the box. Two of those methods are moot because you have to open the box before finding out the information. The expiration date is on the back of the DVD in fine print, meanwhile the  "+ digital copy" is in very large print on the front of the box. How many times do you look at the back of a movie before buying it? So obviously Warner Brothers wasn't helpful, and Target wouldn't take the movie back even though some of the "product" had expired before purchase because I had opened it. I have unsuccessfully tried to resolve this with the corporations involved, so I'm warning the public directly now to prevent it from happening to other consumers.
