In a sentence: This anime series features a lot of adult natured ecchi comedy with minimal redeeming qualities.

If you are looking for something deep, look elsewhere. There is no thinking involved in this series and the characters are void of many interesting qualities. The main character Tomoki (voiced by Greg Ayres) is definitely the best part of the show as he is the main catalyst for much of mischief and comedy involved in the series. There is really no meaningful story, except for the final episode or two when they try to tie everything up and jam it down your throat at the last second because it is ending. But for this type of genre, I guess that is somewhat expected. That said, I still made it through the series and enjoyed most of it. It can be funny at times and it is very ecchi most of the time. If you are looking for something different, give it a try, but with so many other great series out there, you really will not be missing anything if you skip over this title.

Animation is good, character models are good, humor can be good, story is non-existant, pretty mindless most of the time, probably not a repeat viewing in my future.

** I mostly wanted to write a review to counteract all of the 5 star reviews claiming how amazing the series is, as that was a pretty substantial reason I ended up purchasing the series. Liking an anime series is always based on opinion, and in my opinion, this was just ok.
