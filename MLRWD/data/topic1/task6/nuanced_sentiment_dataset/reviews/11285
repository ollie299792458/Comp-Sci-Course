Five of the cartoons on here are classics, which is the reason I wanted this collection.  The oldest, and, indeed, the first animated special produced for TV, "Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol," was unfamiliar to me but it is charming.  Unfortunately, the last two cartoons are not worth the time it takes to view them.  "Cricket on the Hearth" was predictable and dull.  In contrast to the five classics, which I re-watch every year, I wouldn't have an interest in seeing this one again.

The last movie, "Frosty Returns" is NOT to be confused with the original Rankin-Bass sequel where Frosty gets married ("Frosty's Winter Wonderland." Oh, no, this is a modern cartoon, and it is cringe-inducingly awful.  The premise - a bad guy similar to Mr. Burns from "The Simpsons" wants to melt all the snow and some snow-weary residents think this is a good idea so it is up to the kids and Frosty to save winter - is fine, but the execution is appalling.  The character of Frosty is unpleasant and has a grating, horrible voice.  The worst part is the music - the songs are painful, unlistenable.  I can't articulate how poorly done this cartoon is.  It's not bad in a fun way that might lead it to become a cult classic; it's just bad.  I don't understand why the DVD, since it had other Rankin-Bass specials, didn't have the real sequel, which is what I thought I was getting.
