This review has a funny title, but it's a phrase used often.  The fellow on the illustrated cover is a good man, auto mechanic and companion to a graduate student studying elephant migratory patterns in South Africa.  He's the one who uses the phrase most.

There's a family-group leader from the Kalahari Desert, who's trying to get rid of something that caused trouble in the group. How do you share something easily when there's only one?

Add to the situation mix a young woman who, frustrated with the rat race and her newspaper job, takes a teaching job near the Kalahari Desert.  Oh, yes, one can't forget the bad guys and their plan to stage a coup in their country.

This is an unlikely mix of story lines, yet they all fit together.  I've seen this movie numerous times, and just bought another copy of the video because the old one is worn out.  It's quite funny, and I use the power of comedy in life.
