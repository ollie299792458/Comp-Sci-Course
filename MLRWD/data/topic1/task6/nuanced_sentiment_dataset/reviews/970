This is easily in the top five worst films I've seen in the last 10 years. The previews had me thinking I was going to see a good action movie with one of my favorite actors playing a hitman whose off to the far east for what promises to be a series of high adventures. The movie starts out with Cage narrating his actions and I was thinking I was happy to be watching this film. As he goes off to Thailand I still believed the movie had a chance and then everything went sideways and became more predictable than almost anything I'd seen in quite some time. The storylines were bad, the acting was bad, the action sequences were bad, basically nothing was good. There's the bad man grows tired and wants to quit storyline that's been done too many times before. There's the innocent girl who could maybe help him turn it around and find happiness but surely won't understand his world storyline that's been done too many times before. There's the "wanna be" young guy who realizes he doesn't really know what he was asking for when he asked to be taught the ropes and now wants to not be a bad guy storyline that's been done before. There's the big, bad boss who decides to go after the hero because he's too dangerous storyline that's been done too many times before. There's the big, bad boss right hand man and his goons who go after the hero but aren't quite good enough to get him storyline that's been done too many times before. And so on and so on and so on. The end of the movie absolutely ruined the whole thing if it's possible to ruin an already one star movie. If I could rate this with a half a star I would. I can't tell you how glad I am that I rented this movie and didn't waste the money to see it in the theater. In short, it was awful.
