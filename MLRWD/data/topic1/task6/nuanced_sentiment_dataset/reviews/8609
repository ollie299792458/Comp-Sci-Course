Apparently there are cleaner copies out there. That's good. I first saw this movie long ago (on 16mm) when I read the book but forgot most of it. Gary Cooper & Helen Hayes were great actors even back in 1932. They are the best part of the movie. One of Hemmingway's best novels, did not make a good transition. I'm not sure he knew Cooper personally at this time but did pick him for the role of Lt. Henry. They were close afterwards. Hemmingway didn't like the movie much. I don't remember seeing Helen Hayes very often, her being a stage actress. She is wonderful & gorgeous as Katherine & may have loved Cooper for real as lots of his leading ladies did. If she didn't, that's good acting. It is war & theirs is a really hot, sexual love affair. The war intervenes & separates them. The battle scenes & the montages of Lt. Henry's search through Italy for Catherine was a mess. Were all the scenes shot at night? That made it rather tedious. Adolphe Menjou had a meaty role as Major Rinaldi, Lt. Henry's doctor, best friend & ultimately the source of all his problems. It's on from time to time. Or find a clean copy to own.
