First of all, it was too short.  At 104 minutes, there is hardly enough time (as the movie shows) to develop the dozens of characters that are a) introduce and b) have disappeared.  Major characters are simply written off or ignored.  While Wolverine is my favorite and certainly takes the lead role along with Jean Gray, Storm, whom I would describe as one of the least popular characters, even though played by a very attractive actress, is pushed to the forefront (rumor has it because because Halle Barry threw a fit about her small roles).  Characters are introduced and lead you to believe that they will serve a purpose, then you don't see them again for an hour, at which time they make a 10-second appearance.  Also, the pseudo-goth mutants that Magneto takes on as his proverbial "posse", are laughable.  The 'no one understands me so I'll wear all black and cover myself in piercings' has worn very thin.  All these things aside, i did have a problem with the final fight scene with Magneto and Pyro - like they couldn't find anything better to do than toss burning car after burning car for 5 consecutive minutes?  Magneto was infinitely more diabolical in the first two and has taken a serious step back.  I did, however, enjoy the Wolverine/Phoneix part.  This movie would have been GREAT - had it been the first movie in the X-Men series, but, as the third in a series of who-knows-how-many films, I really expected a little better.  Either way, this movie was still a million times better than Superman...
