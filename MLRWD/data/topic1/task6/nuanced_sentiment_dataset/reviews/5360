As a fan of great science fiction (come on, who isn't), I feel it is my duty to notify the public of this terrible... of everything science fiction is meant to be, both from a story and character point of view.  First, the story of Red Planet.  I only watched the movie once (so maybe I'm not exactly the expert here), but from what I could tell, the mission that the characters were involved in was neither terribly important, nor worth the cost of human life.  Yet, as the Hollywood tradition says, one must spend much and make with the death in order to succeed.  For Val Kilmer movies, the formula seems to work.  Now for the characters.  I do have one question, why in the world would you pay for Terrence Stamp simply to sell him off like he was a used car.  Here's an idea, don't allow us to sympathize with anyone who will only been in the movie for 15 minutes.  Tom Sizemore has also seen better days...roles...directors...movies.  When you look at his past career (I know not everyone liked The Relic the same way I did), he could have had a much more likable part.  Val Kilmer plays a half-wit in a half-wit movie, so I won't torture him.  As for Carie Ann-Moss (of the triple name armada), she could be more monotonous, but only if this movie had a higher budget.  AMEE is a HAL-9000 type, so at least she has more character than everyone else in the film.  
Aside from the acting, the special effects were atrocious.  Am I the only one that thought the effects were terrible?  That matting on all the dark sky scenes is horrible.  It's like they gave a three year old the scissors and said "cut away."  I hope that Warner Bros. can recover from this gigantic flop of a movie.
P.S.... I wouldn't buy the DVD.
