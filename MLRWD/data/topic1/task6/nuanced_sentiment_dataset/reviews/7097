We have this magician, Frank Cadillac (love of Frankenstein+Cadillacs=whatever), with foresight into the next 2 minutes.  Enter Julianne Moore working for the government to stop terrorists from blowing up 8 million people with a nuclear weapon & she can see no other way than to have this freak working for her.  Everyone does what Moore wants without question, except of course for Cage.  Cage only cares about his girlfriend and for some strange reason he can see her future better than anything else, like 18 hours or some ridiculous thing.  Moore engages in some radical persuasion tactics to get Cage to comply. She has this special room with these little torture devices to hold his eyelids open.  Are we supposed to hate her?  She explains that she's a good guy, but this movie just can't seem to figure it out either.

Cage is strange looking in this film and the romance isn't convincing at all. An odd cameo by Peter Falk is pasted in.  At the end Cage's character starts morphing into all these different versions of himself to go on wild goose chases & to fight people.  I guess it's over my head because I just don't get how he does that. Hello?  Show me a stupid movie with a stupid premise then actually ask me to think?  The movie cuts off abruptly as though they were too lazy to tell you the rest of the story. This would have been a good time for Paul Harvey to make a cameo.  I hated to see Cage and Moore in this film as I am doggedly hanging onto the belief that each of them is better than this.
