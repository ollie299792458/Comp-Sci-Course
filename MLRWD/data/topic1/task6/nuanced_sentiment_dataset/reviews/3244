Carrie is not so much a horror movie as it is a revenge movie. Spacek's performance is heartbreaking as the traumatized teen who everyone seems to dislike. Carrie's life is a living hell both at school and at home with her fanatically religous mother. The viewer immediately sympathizes with Carrie and we feel good when Carrie starts coming out of her shell. When she dresses up and goes to the prom with her handsome date we feel as though the ugly duckling is becoming a beautiful swan. But suddenly a vicious final prank unleashes Carries' telekinesis full force on the prom crowd. The special effects are good, but weak in some parts. For example the part where Nancy Allen and Travolta get theirs is too short and somewhat contrived. It just seems to come out of nowhere with no build at all. But aside from that, the movie is perfect. One thing that made this movie great for me was the music. Carrie's theme heard in the beginning and at the end is one of the most beautifully haunting melodies I've ever heard in film. Hearing that melody for the first time at the beginning of the movie just captured me and never let go. Carrie is a wonderful movie any way you look at it.
