I enjoyed The Strangers; I really did.  The setup is simple, the execution frightening.  The ending, however polarizing, is truthful to what comes before it and earns its place in the film.

Having said that, I recommend that before seeing this movie, you watch the 2006 French film Them (Ils) on which it was based.  No, that's not right.  Let me try again.  I recommend that before seeing this movie, you watch the 2006 French film Them (Ils) that The Stangers writer-director Bryan Bertino flat-out ripped off.  Now that I think about it, "ripped off" might be too kind a term.  It insinuates that Bertino simply stole the *idea* of the movie instead of lifting scenes directly from it and planting them in his own movie.  It's basic, good old-fashioned plagiarism at work here, and I think Bertino should be a little bit ashamed of himself for thinking that no one would ever notice that he copied an infinitely superior and little-seen French film.

As a punctuation point, when asked during an interview if The Strangers was influenced by an "original movie or other films," Bertino carefully replied: "I don't necessarily think that I looked at it."  The title to which the interviewer was referring is not mentioned, but I'm pretty sure it was Them.  The similarities are too many to be coincidental, and Bryan Bertino's response is more than vague; it's downright evasive.
