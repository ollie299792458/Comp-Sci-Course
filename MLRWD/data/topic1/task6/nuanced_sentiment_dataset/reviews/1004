Well, Hollywood makes movie trailers over the top so naturally when I saw the trailer for this film, I thought for sure this was a big budget movie.  Thankfully, I continued to read about the movie before I saw it and came across it's actual price tag.  Let me just say that for the money that made it, something special was put together here.  This is a dark film that doesn't rely on CGI wizardry to the extent that others of its kind do.  No one watches these kinds of films for Oscar acting.  These kinds of films are action mood pieces, period.  They can either be good or bad and it's that simple.  Underworld is just plain good, utilizing some seriously creative ideas, one of which I have never seen or expected (the idea of mixing a vampire with a werewolf, oh yeah, I felt the love too).  Great storytelling.  Great original characters.  Awesome use of color/tint.  I expect a sequel but I'm hopefull that they don't use more money the next time like so many other sequels.  More money may actually hurt this story.  Never thought I'd say that about a movie.
