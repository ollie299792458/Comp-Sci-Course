when i first saw the trailer for 'bring it on,' i thought it was going to bomb.  i had absolutely no inclination to see a movie about a cheerleading competition.  but everyone that i knew who had seen it loved it.  after hearing this, i wanted to check it out for myself.  however, i am a guy, and it's pretty emasculating to run over to blockbuster and rent a movie ostensibly directed towards teenage girls. i finally got to watch it a couple weeks ago with my little niece (how convenient), and i felt the same way as many of my (guy) friends...i loved it.
even as a simple teenie-bopper movie, it works on many levels. characters spoke in more or less vernacular teenage slang (a la 'clueless'), not like eloquent wordsworths as the twenty-something teens from dawson's creek.  the writing surprised me.  it showd a wittiness and biting sarcasm that could bring a smile to even the most uptight conservative.  the acting was adequate, and good in some areas (eliza dushku, kirsten dunst), and the performances were top-quality.  too bad the 'token' minority cheerleading squad were portrayed as one-dimensional, only seen outside their uniforms in one short scene.  but perhaps delving deeper into the whole race/blaxploitation thing would have hindered the carefree spirit of the movie.  
so just to conclude, 'bring it on' is pure entertainment, and i'm not ashamed to admit that i liked it.
