I have to say as a Street Fighter fan I was completely disappointed with this movie. Some others said it was suppose to be a spoof on action flicks and just can't seem to understand why we die hard fans hated this... The movie is suppose to be about STREET FIGHTING! Hello geniuses! Not only that i wanted to see a movie about my favorite fighting game, not one making fun of it. 
  This entire movie was just another excuse to give Van Damm a reason to hog the camera (Shockingly enough, many say this is his best action film! My God, how cruel can you people be?!). He plays the American Coronel Guile in the movie, but what the heck was up with the Austrian accent?! (If you think that's bad you should hear him speak English in real time. For the love of god, how many has he lived in America? None of the fight scenes in the movie were anything special or in the least bit memorable, although i will give Chun Li's scene against Bison props. She didn't do too bad a job. I wanted to see more.  
  Even though not much is known about the street fighter storyline, would it have killed the director to stick with what little bit was known? The dialogue between the characters was pretty... Sadly to say the best lines spoken in the movie were the ones when Guile gives an 'supposedly' inspirational speech to his troops. The casting just could have been way better. Bison looked all skinny and shiveled. He wasn't in the least bit convincing as a martial artist. Blanka's makeup was horrible! He looked like the incredible hulk! God there is just so much i could say about how much this movie... but i can't. If you really must see this movie just rent it.
