If memory serves me well I recall watching and re-watching this gem at 4:00 on Million Dollar Movie channel 11 (9? Sorry- I confuse WPIX and WOR!). While I wasn't really "scared" something intrigued me enough to hold my attention for repeated viewings! I think as a child the concept of a tentacled eyeball must've fascinated me as I liked to draw the monsters in my doodle pads. As I developed a sense of quality I assumed that this was just another melodramatic cheesy monster flick with the lowest production values. On a lark, I bought the film to re-watch several years ago when it was released on DVD and was shocked to realize that the acting wasn't of the chewing the scenery variety and though the primitive monster effects were still intact- well, that's just an ingredient of the charm of these chestnuts. What really surprised me though was the writing. It could've been as ridiculous as, say, Queen of Outer Space or Plan Nine, but it was far above that level- especially for the period.

Gosh, wish I could find a copy of the "intact" Giant Behemoth now- I understand that one (another afternoon staple of Million Dollar Movie lineup) had the monster eating people scenes removed.

I'm surprized some smartass hasn't thought to remake these loveable old horrors!
