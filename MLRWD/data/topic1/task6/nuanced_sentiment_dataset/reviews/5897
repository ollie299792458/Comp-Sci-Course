Intacto has an interesting premise:is there truly luck or simply fate. A more rational explanation might be cold randomness. The characters play incredulous games with the hope of winning luck. Winning someone's luck give you more luck. And I suppose that the loser is "out of luck." The ultimate test is for the person who thinks that he is lucky to challenge the Godfather of Luck. If someone beats the Godfather, then he becomes the new Godfather (a point that is never quite explained).

Throughout this story of good and bad luck, the director mixes love. The good fortune of the luckiest person on earth turns out to be not luck at all, but based on another's selflessness and love. You might think that anyone who owes his life to love given by another would lead his own life in a similar manner, but not in Intacto: Mr. Lucky shows little care for others. He's selfish.

The film also attempts to touch on the concept of "truth," but fails because of conflicting actions. One one hand we have an aircraft accident survivor who's girlfriend did not make the same trip because he tells her "I don't love you anyone." This is confounding because the survivor "saves" the life of his lover by lying to her: he actually does love her. On the other hand, a policewomen does not love her husband, and not telling him so leads to his demise.

I like the story, the action, and the twists and turns. The film's downfall is a conflicting and confusing array of ideas that are touched upon, but never fully realized. Character development is also sketchy. I had little empathy for the strangers in Intacto, and therefore little emotional investment in the outcome. The film is, for lack of a better word, cold.
