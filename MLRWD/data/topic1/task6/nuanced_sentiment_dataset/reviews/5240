Kiss of the Dragon is not Jet Li's best by any stretch, but still a fun movie especially for fans of Jet, and perhaps more so for action fans than for hard core martial arts fan (of which I'm one).  So while this film is no Fearless or Fist of Legend, they do not lend a fair comparison as they are not the same type of movie.  Where I would consider the aforementioned as 'martial arts films,' this is more of an action film.  The difference being simply an action film relies on more than just martial arts, also gun play etc.  Still, even as an action movie, it is heavy on martial arts, so gets much more credit than the disapointing 'War' (with Jet Li and Jason Statham).

A lot of reviews trash the story, but considering the bulk of action movies out there, I'd say it is actually a pretty good story; it just wasn't flushed out as well as it could have been.

Your interest in this movie will probably be determined by the type of action you are looking for.  For the action sequences, Kiss of the Dragon is more gritty (more like Unleashed, though not as good).  And while Jet displays some impressive martial arts, quick editing takes away some of the novelty, bringing more attention to the 'action' and less focus on solid scenes of the martial arts, if that makes ANY sense at all.

While this is obviously not an Oscar winning film, it's still very enjoyable.  If you are in need of a good display of butt-kicking, this will be a good fix.

I bought this DVD, and have no regrets.  My rating of 3 stars is simply because Jet had much better films, but that doesn't mean this one is no good.  Also includes some decent special features including some clips of coreographer Corey Yeuen, Jet's philosophy of fighting, and commentary by the lead roles.
