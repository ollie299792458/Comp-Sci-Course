In Kicking and Screaming, Will Ferrell is again saddled with a sub-par script.  He has some great co-stars, namely Robert Duvall and Mike Ditka, who carries a great presence on the screen.  The premise revolves around a meek guy (Ferrell) and his cartoonishly competitive relationship with his own father (Duvall), who coaches his son's soccer team.  Gramps decides to trade his untalented grandson to another team - the worst in the league.  Through a series of wacky events, Ferrell becomes the coach of the rag tag team, a Bad News Bears knock-off with less charm and humor.  Other than Ferrell's screen son, the only other kid with much charisma is a pint size Asian boy whose character is named Byon Sun.  As a gag that seems to be meant to save the movie from itself, Ditka(who in the film is Duvall's neighbor band rival) becomes Ferrell's assistant coach.  Hilarity ensues, and the movie plods to its predictable conclusion.

Ditka's performance is actually the best thing to be seen here, with Ferrell trying hard but not getting many laughs.  The script caters more to 10-12 year olds than to adults.  Perhaps that is the point.  Final grade - D+
