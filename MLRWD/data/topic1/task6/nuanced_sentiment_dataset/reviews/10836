I could go on all day talking about all the silly, unrealistic goings-on in this movie - the guy with a gun runs from the guy without one, the hero flips his car to remove a bomb attached underneath, a helicopter explodes after being shot about three times with a uzi(!), and yet later in the film a half dozen men empty rounds of ammunition into the heros car and he emerges unscathed..

But hey, it's an action movie right?, what else would you expect?

You don't watch movies like this for the oscar winning performances or the great plot, you watch them because you wanna see sh-t get f-cked up, because while it may not challenge you, the viewer, at all, it's a whole lot of fun! And you can rest assured that this film is certaintly fun, of course all the compulsory cliche scenes meant to give the characters depth are there, but they're over as quickly as they'd begun, replaced by over-the-top action scenes, involving fast cars, half naked babes, some very stylish fights and a whole lot of gunplay.

If you enjoyed films like 'Bad Boys 2' and  'Mission Impossibe 2' then you're sure to love 'Transporter 2' but if you prefer good acting and a decent plot with your action, i suggest trying something such as 'Man On Fire'..
