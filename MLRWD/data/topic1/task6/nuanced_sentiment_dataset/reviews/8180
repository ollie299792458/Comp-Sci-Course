Im a ZEP FREAK also and I say buy it not just for the nicely re-done sound and video but for all the extra`s themselves.
Unlike the other reviewer before me I think its well worth the extra $.
No the shirt isnt the best made shirt in the world but its still nice and all the extras are very nice treats,from the press photo`s all the way to the ticket replicas its all a must have if you LOVE and adore ZEPPELIN & collect their stuff besides just the music..I have everything Zeppelin ever did including almost all the singles including their solo years singles and full versions and promos from all three remaining members..I liked this set very much including all the extra collectables that definately added to an allready massive collection I allready have of tickets,press kits,etc from them but loved each and every piece that this collectors set had to add to my collection..Dont forget the free POSTER deal by mail to top things off..
A blank DVD case will fill the gap from the shirt being removed to keep your outside box in nice condition and fill the empty space..

My suggestion:By this set before its in the $200 range...
