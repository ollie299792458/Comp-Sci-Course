This is one of the cutest chick flicks I've ever seen. Romantic comedy? Well, sort of. Our heroine, feminist writer Barbara Novak (Renee Zellweger) is out to change the world. How? By getting women to say "down with love," and adopt a more male life style--complete with sex a la carte!

Novak's plans are jepordized, however, when playboy journalist Catcher Block (Ewan McGreggor) is abadoned by his usual ladies. He is determined to stop Novak once and for all--using some very sneaky methods...

As other reviewers have pointed out, this movie is certainly lacking in substance. But who cares? You wanted a comedy, right? What this movie does have, in delightful abundance, is that old theatre charm. The acting, the comedy, and the special effects are all WAY over the top. But hey, not every movie is meant to be some deep, insightful masterpiece. If you do look beneath the surface, however, you will find one very important lesson: people are not always what they appear to be.
