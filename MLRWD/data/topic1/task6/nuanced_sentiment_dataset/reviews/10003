I'm not going to go in to what the movie is about, because many people have already said that in these reviews already.

What I will review is the video itself. I really do appreciate the fact that many new movies are coming out with a 1.7/8x:1 aspect ratio (fills screen on hdtvs, no black bars.) True 2.3x:1 televisions could be another 20 years away, and so many newer and older movies are shot at in this aspect ratio.

2.3x:1 movies are actually recorded with the black bars encoded in them, with just slightly more resolution than let's say a letterbox movie. A letterbox movie is hard-coded with black bars larger than that of anamorphic widescreen dvds and hd dvds, at 4:3 aspect ratio. VHS, laserdiscs (with the exception of a hand full of titles near the end of the laserdisc era), and some dvds used the letterbox format, as opposed to anamorphic widescreen.

An example of 2.3/4x.1 ratio movies are the star wars series, and 1.7/8:1 movies are this title (slither) and hell night.

Full Screen or Pan N Scan (4:3) = Stretched Image on hdtv.

Letterboxed w/2.3/4:1 movie (4:3) = Stretched Image on hdtv w/ black bars

Letterboxed w/1.7/8:1 movie (4:3) = Stretched Image on HDTV

Anamorphic 1.7/8:1 (16:9) = Stretched Image/Full Screen on hdtv

Anamorphic 2.3/4:1 (16:9) = Stretched Image/Black Bars

HD DVD at 1.7/8:1 (16:9) = Full Screen on hdtv

HD DVD at 2.3/4:1 (16:9) = Black Bars on HDTV

Let's talk about overall picture quality. I've read several reviews about the video quality on slither, which so many people think it is terrible. Yes, it's sort of in a b-movie style, and no, it's not King Kong quality, but it's still pretty good for what it is.

The flick itself is decent, worthy of watching, not to mention you get both the DVD version and HD DVD version on the same disc. This is a great HD DVD to add to your collection.
