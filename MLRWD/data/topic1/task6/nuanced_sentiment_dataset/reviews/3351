I am not the typical go-out-and-buy-the-latest-dvd-for-your-kids sort of mom, but I had missed seeing this at my local IMAX and that just made me want to see it more than ever. I picked it up a day or two after Christmas at a local store for the same price as Amazon is selling it ($19.96). The story progresses slowly and inches it's way to a classic, beautiful ending (which I will not ruin for you!) that is actually a joyous expression of the Christmas season. I think both children and adults will enjoy this, although my husband seemed to be slightly disinterested in the movie. The movie did have interesting and unexpected twists, but when those appeared I always knew they would work themselves out, although I do think that the younger children will enjoy the suspense. This movie is so unique and worthwhile that I cannot think of any other movie like it. It's sure to be a timeless classic, and even though I own the DVD now, I will definately have to see it at the IMAX should it be showing again next holiday season.
