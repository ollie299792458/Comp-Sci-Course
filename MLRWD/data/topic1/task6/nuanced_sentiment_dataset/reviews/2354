i became aware of this title doing a search using the word "yakuza". i read the editorial reviews and customer reviews on amazon and elsewhere. references to "the godfather" had been made. so i pre ordered the box set. the release date had been put back which heighten my anticipation. once received even the packaging looked impressive. but less than (2) minutes into disc (1) something seemed familiar. the acting,the type of music score, the fake gun shot sound effects. i thought i was watching an old "sonny chiba" movie. i personally didn't see any relation between the high praise in the reviews and the film itself. the acting wasn't believable. everybody is entitle to their own opinion but to use words like "the godfather" and "take a ruthlessly de-romanticized view of the underworld" is almost comical. when i think of serious japanese films  it's "harakiri","throne of blood", "high and low" and "stray dog" not the old "street fighter" movies. my advise for what it's worth, if you've never seen these films (rent them first or buy one disc at a time).
