This was the third of Harryhausen and Charles Schneer's Sinbad films and certainly the weakest. I hate to re-hash the same old points everyone knows, but this script is terrible. The story is just flawed and confused,  everytime I see this film I just can't beleive they could not have put  together a simple story that would have been much better than the mess they  did use. The whole baboon angle was so much like bad saturday morning tv.  There are two other small points that always bother me, one is that the  mighty gold minotaur gets destroyed by pulling out a stone instead of  fighting Sinbad. The other is that Zenobia orders her son to kill  Melanthius with a dagger and there were three men and a baboon standing  around him, that one always makes me shake my head. However, I think the  acting is pretty good except the villains Rafi and Zenobia who were  definitely third rate, but Tom Baker's fantastic performance in the  previous film may have some impact on that view. I think Patrick Wayne did  as good as he could with the script he was given. Wayne, Patrick Troughton  and Tyrone Power's daughter were certainly the standouts in this film.  Harryhausen's effects are great, the giant walrus is probably my favorite  because the snow really adds to the battle. The sets and settings are of  the same great quality that a Schneer/harryhausen film always had. Not all  that good of a movie, but the effects make it worth seeing.
