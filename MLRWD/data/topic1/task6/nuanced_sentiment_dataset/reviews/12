I love "An Affair to Remember" for many reasons. Most of all, I rate it right after "Casablanca" on my list of favorite films because it too deals honestly and in a heart-felt way about people and what they often wish they felt more often in their lives: simple yet passionate love for another. Nicky Ferrante  and Terry McKay cannot really live without each other - - - now, that is how  people who say that they are in love ought to feel, not the mediocre, middling (practical?) manner that one often sees manifested by couples in the present. Now, Cary  Grant - - - he's definitely "da man," all we blokes out here can only  hope to be so gracious, cool, and yet humbly self-aware as this fellow. I have long watched Cary Grant for clues about personal deportment, appearance, dress, and, more importantly, how to treat those who I meet along the way of my life. Not that Deborah  Kerr is a slouch - - - she is as feminine as I like (i.e., a lady such as the ones Irene Dunne, Claudette Colbert, and Audrey Hepburn played in their movies), not  to mention lively, lovely, and strong. "An Affair to Remember"  has the kind of chemistry that all of our romances should have (if only we  guys could all be like Cary Grant, the world would be a more peaceful, pleasant, and romantic place).
