Obviously a labor of love for Duvall, who wrote, produced, directed, and stars in this film. Unfortunately, such involvement often obscures objectivity on the part of the film-maker, and that seems to be the case here. Duvall plays a hitman sent to Argentina for his latest job. The tango subplot really has nothing to do with the assassination plot (other than the weak link that, having to put off the assassination for several days, the hitman spends his time in a tango club and befriending a tango dancer); or perhaps it's that the assassination subplot has nothing to do with the tango plot. There are too many unexplained elements in the plot (for example, why were the Argentinian contacts apparently trying to set him up?), and while not everything need to be spoonfed to the viewer, a film like this still ought to have some coherent plot line. Nor does the film work as a character study of an apparent paradox - the cold-blooded hitman who has such affection for a woman and her daughter. Give this one a miss unless you are a die-hard Duvall fan and feel you need to see anything he acts in or directs.
