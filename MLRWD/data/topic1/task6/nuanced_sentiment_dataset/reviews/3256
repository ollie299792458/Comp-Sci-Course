I saw this movie with a few friends in the theater when it first came out; because of the excellent cast and the publicity it received, I thought it would be a good choice for a night out. I was extremely disappointed by the vulgarity and extreme crudity in this film, and I am far from a prude. It seemed to be all slapstick and sex jokes and very little in the way of a meaningful plot. There are a few funny moments, and Vaughn and Wilson are worth seeing for diehard fans, but the script is unexceptional as far as humor is concerned. The romance was what really cemented my dislike for the movie. It was sappy, implausible, and simply irritating. It was predictable, but not even in a charming, reassuring way. I was annoyed by the shallow, selfish characters and felt no emotional attachment to them whatsoever, no desire for them to succeed or even to know how they would end up. I found the film excruciatingly dull the first time, and when my brother rented the DVD this impression was reaffirmed. Unless you are crashing a wedding yourself and need some encouragement, you can skip this one.
