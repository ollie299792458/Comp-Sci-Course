Setting aside the gross inconsistencies with the original stories, this film does little to distinguish itself from any run-of-the-mill made-for-cable movie. The actors are adequate, and the production values are adequate, but the script is dull and predictable. There is nothing to hook the viewer in at all. The makers seem to concede this fact by throwing in plenty of cheescake (various women are eager to bed young Sherlock) that serves no narrative purpose and does nothing to add depth to any of the characters, for whom it is hard to feel anything but indifference. The romantic element is also just tacked on in the most generic fashion, and is ineffective precisely because the viewer could care less about either Sherlock or what's-her-name. There is plenty of filler, such as the recurring flashback of the villain injecting Sherlock's older brother with something nasty. The scene is filmed (or rather digitally dressed up) in a slick, MTV-ish style, but it lacks emotional impact, and by the third or fourth time we've seen it, it's just plain tiresome. The film doesn't even rise to the level of cotton candy; it's more like that dried-up, crunchy bit a chewing gum that used to come with a pack of trading cards. The only people who seem really enthusiastic about the project are the set and costume designers, and maybe some others involved in creating the look of the film. Because in the end, the look is all this film has to offer.
