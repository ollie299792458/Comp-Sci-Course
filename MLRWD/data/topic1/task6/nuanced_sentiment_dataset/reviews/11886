Man oh man did this season suck, I can only remember a handful of funny moments, in fact I think I'll list them now:

-the Implication
-the Who Got Dee Pregnant episode
-Frank's sex scene in Lethal Weapon 5
-Charlie talking about beating up Dee's baby (which was only funny because of the bloopers)

and that's it. The whole season is a bunch of misses that are just embarrasing to watch, it's painfully obvious the original crew didn't write these episodes and instead it was handled by 'professional writers'. So the characters aren't really themselves this season, it's more of the characters trying to play themselves (that sentence made more sense in my head) and it is awfully predictable. "Oh boy, here goes Charlie again, isn't he sooo craaazy being a school janitor??". Ugh.

Also it's always sunny's blatant product placement is more obvious here, the whole Dennis gets Divorced episode might as well take place in a subway, because I only really remember that you can get a sweet breakfast at subway. Their coors lights are omnipotentally present as well, always facing the camera and reminding you that if you want to be cool like the gang, you better drink the beer they drink.

I remember episodes like Mac's big break, Mac & Charlie: White Trash, and The gang gets a new member, and can't recall a single joke from the whole thing. It's just the characters going through the motions, and they look as bored as I feel watching this season. The whole second half of "the gang buys a boat" where it shows Frank, Dee, and Charlie on the boat, where was the humor? Instead it felt like some stupid 'bonding' moment, and I'm supposed to lap it up thinking "that's my favorite gang, doing what they do best", no. Maybe moments like when everyone is smiling at Dee's baby works for the die hard fans who are just happy to see their favorite characters again but when they stand around acting sappy I get bored, fast. Little Seventh Heaven moments like those do not fit with this show at all.

See the reason why I liked IASIP in the first place was in the earlier episodes the gang was always scheming to screw each other over, episodes like The Gang Runs for Office or The Gang Dances Their Asses Off showcase this well, and it was entertaining to see who'll come out on top in the end and how, but in the new episodes they're just a band of misfits being awkward in the real world, talk about lazy writing. It's such a bummer that the same show that had the really well written Mac's Banging Dennis' Mom episode to The Gang Get's Stranded in the Woods.

Lastly IASIP had some fads catch on, such as Greenman or Dayman, but here it's just painful watching them try to force it. In the single aforementioned 'good' episode I think the dialogue goes like this verbadum: "I browned out that night" "Wait browned out, what's that?" "Well it's sort of like a black out but not as much" "Wow I'm going to have to add that to my vocabulary from now on and constantly use it" (they never did after that episode thankfully) "So anyways I was browning out that night *wink*". Oh and on a totally different subject you can order your awesome "Browned Out" shirt from the offical store!
