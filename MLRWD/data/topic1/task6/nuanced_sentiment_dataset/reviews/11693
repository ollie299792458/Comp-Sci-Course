Kathryn Bigelow's "Point Break" is quite frankly one of the greatest films ever made mainly because what it's not; serious.
This is not a serious film...not in the least, but it is entertaining...which was exactly what the filmmakers intended. As with all action films, there are basic plot elements, and characters that are sometimes thin, but what "Point Break" contains are characters that know exactly what kind of situation they are in, thus making them believable. Patrick Swayze is especially memorable as the zen surf master, Bohdi, who believes that life is a thrill ride designed by gods. The plot is perhaps stretching it a bit (how to stop surfers that rob banks), but the film itself, taking into account the technical aspects of it, is brilliant. Executive Produced and written (uncredited) by James Cameron, Bigelow's film towers above most others in areas of energy,and in surf and aerial cinematography. The film's surf and sky-diving sequences will take your breath away. Other high- lights include virtuoso steadi-cam movement in a memorable foot-chase through a suburban neighborhood. "Point Break" is a film that knew it wasn't going to make AFI's 100 best films ever made...it knew that it wasn't going to change the world in any way...and it knew that it's existance was only to entertain. Because of that, it becomes a film that is astonishing in it's sheer amount of energy, and an example in action filmmaking.
