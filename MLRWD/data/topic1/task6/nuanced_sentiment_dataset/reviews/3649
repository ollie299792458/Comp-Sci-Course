watch the credits carefully, and you'll see the following "Based on a story by Duncan North. Based on an idea by Duncan North.  Based on Duncan North."  Perhaps I'm the first reviewer to notice, but I strongly suspect that this film is biographical.  Watching it for the first time with my then girlfriend, I was embarrassed that she should see it until I realized that no connection could be proven between myself and the main character, Dex: a lovably conceited, overweight berk who uses his superior intellect and twisted view of both Chinese and western philosophy to manipulate those around him until finding that the greater strength is in controlling oneself, embracing uncertainty, and living through love.  Some of the dialogue in the film is clunky, but no more so than real life.  Watch this movie on more than one level, or don't watch it at all.  This is strictly for the the thinking person, and probably more enjoyable to those with at least a passing knowledge of modern American pop culture, philosophy, and dating.  The movie gives one some things to think about, without shoving dogma down the viewer's throat.  Finally, if you're looking for nothing more than a technique for "picking-up chicks," then the technique presented is sound... but finish the movie, and you might learn that there can be more to it.
