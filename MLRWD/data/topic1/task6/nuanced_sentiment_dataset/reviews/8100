I was expecting this collector's edition to be, like, totally unspoiled, man--but really, its just a bad acid flashback.  Unable to achieve, on a level field of play, the special features just consist of a re-run of "the making of the big lebowski" and some random liner notes more cheaply gotten from google than from paying out 15 bones, or clams, or what have you.

I mean, this isn't Nam, Smokey, there are rules--a Collector's edition should be privy to all the new stuff, man!  Where are the retrospectives, where are the commentaries on how "The Great Lebowski" was such an earth-shattering cultural phenom?  A few more extras would have really tied the DVD together, man.

Compared to the oriiginal DVD release, this so-called "special edition" feels as lame as a 9-toed woman. Unless you are a special-feature nihilist (you believe that special features should be nothing).  you're better off with the original-release DVD than this special edition.

Obligatory Parthian shot: Well, its pretty scary, but the Dude & his Lady friend, who he was helping to concieve--their kid is going to first grade this year, apparently!
