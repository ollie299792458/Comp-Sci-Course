This movie wasnt what i expected. But it was still good. This movie ignores the fact that highlander 2 and 3 ever happened. This is the only highlander movie that reflects upon both the first movie and the series. It revolves around and enemy, Jacob Kell (Bruce Payne) of Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) thought to be dead. Connor did not realize it but Kell is immortal. More than 400 years later we are in Present Day New York in the Sanctuary, a place where immortals are put in a form of protective circle. To be removed from the game forever. Connor is one of those mates. He is tired of the endless fight to survive. He is sustained with the memory of his mother's death and the death of Rachael, both done by Jacob Kell. Eventually, Kell and is band of immortals annihilate the sancturary except for Connor, who is let go. And now we are brought to London, England. Where Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul) receives visions of what is happening. He comes to New York to find Connor MacLeod alive, and a vastly enemy upon them. Although, this enemy is to strong, neither one of the Highlanders can beat him alone.
This movie showed many scenes i saw in previews that i did not see in the theatrical version or in the All New Cut video version. There is a scene where you see Connor MacLeod swinging his sword through Jacob Kell's head and Jacob Kell splits into two. There is a scene where Connor MacLeods first sword. Is thrown at Jacob Kell but his hand moves up and it stops. There is a scene where you see both Highlanders jumping through a portal. There is a scene where you see Jacob Kell holding a glass with Connor MacLeods face in it screaming and Kell blows it away. These are all scenes seen in previews that are not seen in the theatrical version and video.
