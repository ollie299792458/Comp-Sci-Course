This is by far one of my favorite movies. I do not however own the DVD version of the film.

Actually I am lucky to own the VHS version. You see one night while I was sleeping an ex-girlfriend decided to assault me with my VHS copy of the film Seven staring Brad Pitt and a human head.

I awoke to the tape bouncing off my noggin...when I realized what was going on it was too late for SEVEN, the tape had been pulled from the plastic rectangle and all I could do was jump to my feet to see what was happening outside my bedroom. What I stumbled upon was pure horror!

The soon to be ex had my copy (my most prized movie possession) of Menace to Society in her clutches and was about to begin dismantling the movie I had come to love. I bolted forward and grabbed the tape from her and escorted her away from the property.

Now most of you may not see this review as a review of the movie, but having a crazy woman try to break your most prized possessions and twarting her efforts on Round 2 (since she won Round 1 with Seven...a film I didn't particularly care for, but stole fair and square from a buddy we call Lunch Box) is a victory for me.

I mean I liked the movie so much I chose it over a woman. And it was the grainy VHS version that needed to be replaced and was outdated anyway.
