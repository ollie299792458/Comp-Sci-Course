I love the Jurassic Park franchise, especially Jurassic Park and Lost World.  The content on these film are very good.  However, these movies lack sound design and quality.  I'm a Film and Video Production major, and so sound is a big deal to me.

For movies about dinos, you'd think that these movies would have outstanding sound, kinda like King Kong.  I understand that the technology was not as great as it is today, but come on.  Like I've read in many others reviews, when T-Rex walks...you should be able to feel it if your sub can handle it.

Now, I'm not writing this to say you shouldn't buy the movies for what they are, because they are great movies.  However, Jurassic Park 3 is the only film that has a DTS track, DTS-ES no less (6.1 channels).  That film sounds great.  JP 1 and 2 come with a Dolby Digital 5.1 track, but it is weak, almost no LFE (Low Frequency Effects) channel, which the sub is in charge of.  Thats the annoying part.

The sound is a bit of a set back, but the beauty of the two films almost cancels out that set back.  Take this for what its worth I guess.

Other than that, great box set.
