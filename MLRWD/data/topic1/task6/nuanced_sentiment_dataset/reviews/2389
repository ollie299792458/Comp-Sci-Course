Having deleted my old review, I'm now going to give a less biased one.

Good:

I don't even need to mention the special effects.

 The atmosphere was really great.

Very good music.

 Ian Malcom and John Hammond were decent characters.

Bad:

The other characters were generic and cliched. Back when I was younger and first saw this is wasn't so bad. Being older and having seen many older movies watching most of JP's character scenes is boring.

Switch "Velociraptors" and for "Xenomorphs" and "Tyrannosaurus" for "alien queen" and it becomes clear that once the action starts, this becomes another rehash of the "alien" formula. Again it wasn't a problem when I was younger and hadn't seen movies like "Alien", but now it seems generic and kind of boring.

A complete waste of Sam Neill's acting.

Everyone who died practically had "dead" written on their forehead in neon.

Overall:

As you may have guessed by now, I don't like this movie because I've basically outgrown it. But I guess it is a decent movie, though tyounger viewers would enjoy it a lot more.
