Lukewarm chills, unexplained plot twists, and blatant product placement make Boogeyman one of the least scary movies I have seen to date. For a short while, the movie seems to have some degree of substance, but, like a bad joke, each granule of substance seems to be met with a "Gotcha!" moments afterwards.

A classic example is in the scene with his girlfriend being eaten by the bathub. He sees bloody fingerprints on the tub and leaves, then later on he reappears and makes those same fingerprints, leaving us to think "hey, this isn't so bad after all, maybe he's the boogie man!" Just as we are starting to think that there may actually be an interesting plot twist, nope, he isn't, just messing with you, leaving us to wonder A) What the point of him showing up at all was and B) Why the girlfriend got eaten by the bathtub (given that the Boogeyman seems to only appear out of closets and reveals himself later to have quite a different concrete form, it must've been some other beastie with nothing to do with the plot!) Rather than making the audience think a little and say "my, that's scary!" Boogeyman relies exclusively on startling images that appear randomly. My advice, don't even bother with this one.
