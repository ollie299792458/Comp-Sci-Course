Back in the late seventies I was first exposed to Buck Rogers via the television show with Gil Gerard.  I later discovered the old serials with Buster Crabbe.  Without the benefit of having read the old comic strip I have no idea which one is more consistent with the original comic strip but I like them both for different reasons.  Although I liked Buster Crabbe better in Flash Gordon he does a great job here as well.  He looks the part and can sell the character regardless of how outlandish the plot was.  One of the things I didn't like was the use of a kid sidekick that was frozen along with him.  I've never liked that concept even with Batman.  Plus having a second person frozen for 500 years with him makes him seem less unique.  Also, Killer Kane didn't seem ruthless enough to me.  There is plenty of action though as he goes from one tough spot to another.  One of the things that I really enjoyed were the extras.  They had some great bios on the different cast members that really made this set a great value.
