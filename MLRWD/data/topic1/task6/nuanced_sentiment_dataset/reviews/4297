Michael Jackson's BAD concert at Wembley Stadium is not just the greatest concert and musical experience ever, it is the greatest thing I ever ever seen, heard or felt in my entire life! It's a truly life-changing experience.

Greater than any movie, greater than any other concert or performance, greater than any sporting event, the greatest thing you will ever see and experience in your life!

Michael Jackson's dancing and energy defies the laws of physics. His singing and vocals defy all adjectives. The music and the sounds are magical. The heart and the soul is indescribable.
