Few people ever talk about the roles that women play in this movie.

 Jennifer has to give up her job because kids come? Bull crap. Why does the *wife* have to give up her job? Did John ever consider giving up *his* job, or perhaps spending a *little* more time with the kids so Jennifer could work? She herself thinks having a baby-sitter would make her a neglectful mother. But nobody ever  wonders if a father is neglectful for letting  someone else raise his kids (babysitter or mother).

I could [sort of] understand Jennifer quitting work to care for three young kids, but what about when the kids get older? She never returns to her job or even thinks about it. She just makes lunch for them and compliments her husband on his newspaper articles. Oh yea, and she encourages John to chase after his dreams, since apparently her career doesn't mean a thing anymore.

 ~Aside from that, I thought the movie was pretty good. XD
I liked how they showed both the story of Marley, and a couple starting a family. The relationship between Jennifer and John was very tender and sweet, and the characters did develop a lot, which I liked. I didn't even come close to crying at the end, though. And Marley is pretty awesome, I wish I could swallow an answering machine and keep on chuggin'
