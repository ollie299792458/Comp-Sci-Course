During the last few years while Hollywood was immersed in their orgy of films that celebrate violence, death and destruction three small European companies got together and hired a gifted writer to adapt Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan, for those who may not be familiar, a much heralded stage drama (a Comedy of manners as it was then called) first presented in the London stage in 1892.

Here is story containing much of the original, brilliant wit of Oscar Wilde.  Here is a lovely cast of carefully selected, talented actors and here is a motion picture every bit as filmic as anything yet done, re-set at the 1930 seaside village of Amalfi, Italy, a watering place for the rich in pre-Hitler Europe.

The period is lovingly restored perhaps only in the ways of Italian craftsmen in costume, architecture, ambiance and even camera film tone.  This care extended to the performances by actors we all recognize and admire; Helen Hunt, here, surprisingly beautiful, Tom Wilkinson and Scarlett Johansson.

The film was not really seen here although apparently released theatrically.  Why not is puzzling and why the critics did not like it while they go bonkers over junk is far beyond my ken.

Fortunately I saw the entire movie on Comcast's On Demand completely free of breaks and commercials on my large Sony Bravia.  For two hours I was in heaven with my cup of coffee and a cinnamon-raisin bagel from Brueggers' downstairs.  If you want to escape to what surely was a more graceful time of letters and human behavior please get a hold of the DVD which is available at this writing.
