When watching this 5 part miniseries on BBC America this past week, I have to say that the first 3 Days out of 5 were intriguing, despite the plot holes and uncharacteristic stupidity.  (One thing that bugs me the most is when my beloved characters do stupid things or do things that they normally won't do.)  The concept was interesting, but then Day 4 came.  And what I knew to be Torchwood was stomped by a giant boot of an ego named Russell T. Davies.  From Day 4 onward, nothing made sense in the Torchwood universe.  The stupidity factor went through the roof.  I only watched Day 5 to see if all the crap was indeed a dream sequence or a cruel joke.  I was desperate to make some sense of the catastrophe that is Children of Earth.

Basically, what happened was Mr. Davies decided to destroy everything he built over two years in the series Torchwood.  The fans did not matter, the characters did not matter, a logical plot did not matter.  The political MESSAGE that Mr. Davies wanted to say was the only thing that mattered. As another reviewer has already mentioned, Mr. Davies doesn't care what his fans think.  In fact, he mocks them.

So if you are a fan of Torchwood, prepare to say your goodbyes to this great series.  If you are a Sci Fi fan, Children of Earth is like Alien 3, which we all pretend didn't happen.  If you are neither a Torchwood fan nor a Sci Fi fan, then I would liken Children of Earth to watching your house burn down with everything you love in it.
