This series was a goldmine for Universal.  No one expected a raunchy story about high school kids trying to get laid to spawn and a franchise and make $350 million in US box office.  The first film is a classic high school movie.  The sequel was good, and funny, but hampered by too many characters and too many storylines.  This one goes back more towards the original, with a few main characters and the rest just fading into the background.  Some addition by subtraction in this movie are the removal of the following characters, Oz, Nadia, and Oz's and Kevin's girlfriends.  See, some of those characters were so useless that I cannot even remember their names.  As usual you get the shot of Jim's dad catching Jim in an embarrassing situation and you have something gross happen to Stiffler.  One of the major flaws is the early incarnation of Stiffler.  At the beginning he is a loudmouth who comes off more as nerd, than jerk.  It takes a few scenes for Stiffler to resort back to being a jerk, the Stiffler that we know and love.  In the end this film draws on the sweetness that made the first two more than gross our comedies.  This is a funny film that, the second time around loses its luster, so this is not really built for repeat viewings.  
About the DVD:  Included on the DVD are deleted scenes.  There is a rather useless documentary on Stiffler speak and a "Cheesy Wedding Video" which is just that, cheesy.  One thing to take from this film is that Stiffler, is best suited as a background character, not as a main character.
