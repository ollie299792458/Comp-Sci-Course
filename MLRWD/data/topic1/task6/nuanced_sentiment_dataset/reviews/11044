Everyone else do yourself a favor and avoid it.  I'm just happy that I saw it on IFC and didn't rent or (heaven forbid) buy the stupid thing.  I was hoping for a movie that would be both visually and intellectually stimulating (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GANX2">The Agony and the Ecstasy</a>) but instead only got one that was pleasing to the eye.  I kept hoping that the story would show up but it never did, unless of course the script read "Scarlet Johansson stands wide eyed and fearful for the next hour and a half."  The romance (if that was what it was) between Griet and the butcher's son was neither developed (did she love him or was she repulsed by him) or necessary.  Nor can I see any reason for the groping scene, the bratty daughter "sub-plot" (you must have a plot before you can have a sub-plot), or pretty much anything else in the movie.  I won't go as far as some to complain about the American accents, since the only way to have real authenticity in that department would be to have everyone speaking Dutch, but the "creepy guy/stalker boss/all men are evil" theme has been done to death and this movie provided us with two examples of it!

I've not read the novel and, as another reviewer stated, now I don't want to but I do hope the rule that the book is better than the movie is the case.

My final thought, nice to look at but otherwise boring and pretentious.
