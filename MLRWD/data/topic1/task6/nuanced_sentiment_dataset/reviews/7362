Ok, ok, so it's NOWHERE near as good as the original, but it really isn't as bad as everyone says. True, the opening sequence is WAY over the top, and needless to say, STOOPID, and Lois Lane is missed, and the villains are second rate(the evil superman was cool though) and the music is out of place. All that aside, the movie was good enough. The plot is pretty simple: outta work schmuck (Pryor) discovers a knack for computer programming and is recruited by slimy corporate bad guy (Vaughn, as pretty much a Lex Luthor rip off) to do all sorts of nasty things, such as hack into weather satelites, steal world oil supply, create synthetic kryptonite (which is the same thing as red kryptonite, just not red) and build a giant super-computer (which is pretty much the same thing as brainiac, especially when it transforms one of the villains into a cyborg, a scene I remember from when I was a kid because it was scary).  Along the way Superman goes to Smallville, saves a chemical plant, romances Lana Lang (O'toole), defeats Brainiac, defeats evil self and, surprisingly, sleeps with bad guy's bimbo. A few things could've made the movie a lot better if 1)Lex Luthor was in it 2)Lois Lane was in it for more than 5 minutes 3)the comedy was toned down a lot 4)the red kryptonite was actually red 5)the computer was actually brainiac. The fight between Clark and evil Superman is also great, even though it could've been a little better if they had taken more advantage of Reeve's great performance. That aside, the dvd is pretty standard, with only the trailer and widescreen. Still, it's worth a look if you're a Superman fan, it should bring back memories from your childhood, or it did for me anyway, considering I was young when it came out.  Check it out!
