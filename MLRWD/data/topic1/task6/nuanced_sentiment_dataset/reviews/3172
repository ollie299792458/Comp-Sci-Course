Like many other reviews about Ghost In The Shell, I highly recommend this movie.  I have had this movie for quite a while, and what has compelled me to write a review is the recent innovations in technology...especially biomedical engineering.  Current research in neuroscience, Electoactive Polymers (plastic muscles), nano-technoloy, flexible electroluminescent panels (could make skin the new light bulb), and replicators (printers that make 3 dimensional objects out of plastics....now some are experimenting with live cultured human cells in hopes to build a new organ (they've already made an ear)) is the science fiction of this movie.  
Ghost in the shell is a powerful movie for those who know what is possible in today's revolutionary merging of man and machine.  Our electrical signals generated in our brains and body are currently being deciphered as a code which is very similar to the 1s and 0s the computer uses you are working on right now.  Soon, with respect to historical timelines, our lives just might be parallel to that of this movie.
Stylistically this movie is sharp, interesting and familiar to most anime fans.  I first saw this movie over seven years ago and was amazed.  Now I occasionally view it and reflect on the technology around me, my colleagues (teachers and scientists), and my students.  Those students will be the scientists who make the subject matter in this movie a reality.  
Get the movie and think.
