I will start of by saying I did watch the orginal series.  I have seen this over and over again I was attempting to figure out what the hype was all about and Well in my Opnion (IMO) They should not have "Remade" This series.  The orginal you have to take alot in it had some great action and awesome grapgics for its time, The orginal story jumped around alot and it seemed that the ending was done to quickly, the orginal did not take "IMO" enough time to explain the main Charaters and made them either realy Winny, Exstreamly tempermental or Emotionaly blank...The orginal I would of given 3 perhaps 4 stars b/c even with some of the flaws you still had a awesome Scf-fi anime but in all that was the Orginal series.

However this is a remake of the orginal series and I do see that they cut alot out to add some eye candy to this generation of Anime viewers. Personaly I think they did a poor job of it and should not of messed with something that had flaws to begin with.

But on a side note it's still a Sci-fi anime with loads of action but b/c of the cuts and the trimming they made I do think they made it much much worse.
