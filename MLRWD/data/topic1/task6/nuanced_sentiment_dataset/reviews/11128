THIS MOVIE IS LIKE A THOUGHT-BOMB ON A TIMER... IT DROPS IN YOUR MIND, LINGERS, AND THEN WILL SUDDENLY EXPLODE! (it all depends on how ready you are for it.) the ideas in this movie are so immense, so intense, so... awesome, it's hard to imagine that people just brashly dismissed it.  this movie will go down in history as the one that everyone will be embarrassed to say they didn't like, or worse, didn't understand.  when the Matrix Revolutions comes out, the Matrix Reloaded will be hailed as one of the greatest movies ever made. why? because this movie is the first two acts, of a powerful movie about self-discovery in the midst of an apocalyptic, cyber-science-fiction-future war. the makers of the movie have all said that they don't want to give answers to their movie that's about finding your own answers, but to skim the surface, let's just say that to start with, it's about PURPOSE. knowing your purpose. finding your purpose. what is purpose? if you don't know, or don't care... then you haven't explored that side of you. this movie will plant a seed that I can only say will bloom either with your help, or on it's own when you're walking down the street one day. but when it does, YOU WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. this movie rocks, and does all of this amidst MINDBLOWING EFFECTS SEQUENCES AND MULTIPLE, PULSE-POUNDING, NEAR-ENDLESS KUNG-FU BATTLES! you will NOT be sorry you bought this movie.
