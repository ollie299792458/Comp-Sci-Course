DAY OF THE DEAD.  George Romero couldn't make a good movie with this title...and apparently, neither can anybody else.

As a C-quality movie this new version of Day of the Dead may be just "passable".  But for fans of cinema or just zombie movies in general, this isn't going to cut it.

Day of the Dead starts out dull with scenarios we're all too familiar with, plods along slowly with one dimensional characters we could care less about, and manages to pick up mild speed when zombies start to appear.

The list of problems with this movie are far too many:
*Are the zombies really undead or just victims of some bio-plague?
*Why do people "convert" to zombies so quickly?
*How can some zombies leap around like they're straight out of Gymkata?
*What is with that funky DVD cover art picture?
*Who believes Mena Suvari or Nick Cannon are really in the military?
*How'd the hot high school babe learn to shoot a gun so fast?
*How much was Ving Rhames paid for his 10-minutes of work?
*And where exactly is this movie going?

On the plus side, the zombies look good and are frightening at times.  There's one stop-pause-rewind death scene worth enjoying, and some of the direction and camera techniques work and give the movie an occasional jolt.

But, it's all far too little to recommend...to even people I don't like (much less the wonderful readers here at Amazon).  So do yourself a favor and rent a good zombie movie like the superior recent remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD or read a great zombie novel like J.L. Bourne's DAY-BY-DAY ARMAGEDDON.
