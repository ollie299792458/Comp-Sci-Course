Hmm, I'm sure it's not just me that finds it more and more difficult to put the Tom Cruise persona to one side and try and be objective about reviewing one of his films. As much as you can do that with MI3 - and it's not always easy as the "character" Tom portrays in the movie is basically exactly the same in personality, attitude and gesture as the ubiquitous Tom Cruise we see all over the media - the resulting movie is everything you expect it to be.
The positives: 1. After the first dull action sequence rescuing a fellow agent in Germany, the remaining action sequences are handled with style and panache. The bridge and Shanghai rooftop sections are very well-staged. Just don't ask why we're in Shanghai anyway!?!?! 2. Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderfully smug and evil although he doesn't actually get to "do" anything in the film.
The negatives: 1. Extremely slight story. 2. The pathetic romance element of the film. 3. Jonathon Rhys-Myers and Tom's non-existent acting. 4. The fact that half the movie seems to be shots of Tom running!
All in all it adds up to a diverting couple of hours in the cinema. Nothing less. Certainly nothing more.
