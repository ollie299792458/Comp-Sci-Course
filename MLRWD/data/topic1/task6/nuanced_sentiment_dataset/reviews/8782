Get over the Segal thing, people.  This movie is not just action.  It's action/suspense, and that's something Segal could never carry by himself.  Yes, he dies early in this movie, but given the talent that permeates the cast, he IS the weakest link.  Don't get me wrong, Segal is good in an action movie, but the man can only play one kind of character (which is why he's the only one in this star-studded cast who is not working right now).  He was put in the same movie with Kurt Russell, Man of a Thousand Characters, a surprisingly effective John Leguizamo (and I wish he'd take more serious parts like this one), a very talented and versatile BD Wong (the non-martial-arts Asian whom nobody appreciated enough to mention), and Oliver Platt, who is entertaining no matter what role he plays.  With these guys on one hand and Segal on the other, you can't blame the powers that be for their (pardon the pun) executive decision.  At least he went out better than Emilio Estevez in Mission Impossible.
