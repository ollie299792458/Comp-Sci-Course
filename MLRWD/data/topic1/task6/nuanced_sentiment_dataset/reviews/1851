I won't go into the plot here since it is mentioned endlessly in other reviews. What I will go into is basic fact. Some have mentioned how bloody and violent this movie is, I've been watching horror films my whole life and I've seen bloodier and more violent films than this one. Alot of the violence occures off camera, what little you do get to see has been done a million times before in other films. In other words, the torture is not seen. Even in the 'Unrated' version. It is implied. My point is that if you want to see this for the gore you will be dissapointed. Only those not used to seeing these kind of films will find this bloody and horrifying. Those of you that have seen other gore films will find this stuff lite.

Others have mentioned the sex in the beginning of the film. What sex? If it had at least that I would have given it a higher rating!

I gave this 2 stars because the story is somewhat interesting. The execution is poor. It takes forever to get to the point. You may want to see this once, rent it, because you may not want to go back for a second viewing.
