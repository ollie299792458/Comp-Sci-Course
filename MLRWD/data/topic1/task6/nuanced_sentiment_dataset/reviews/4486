Two things on this DVD which explores the Cambrian Explosion and its implications:

#1. Beware: It's produced by Illustra Media, which is friendly to the infamous "Intelligent Design" (I.D.) movement[1]. So, while "Darwin's Dilemma" is both engaging and educational, keep in mind that it also interviews I.D. theorists, and intends to tie threads together in the end to make a case for I.D. I subtract a star simply because I, as a layman, didn't come out feeling personally assured that it answered all the possible objections (although, it does seems to cover at least the popular ones I've heard of [e.g. "soft-bodies in the Pre-Cambrian couldn't have fossilized, so it only gives the illusion of an explosion."]; I would have liked to hear more from the other side.)

#2. Friendly or not to I.D., this is a great resource for just learning about this fascinating time-period. It sports the absolute best in computer animation on the era and species, quality interviews from specialists in the field (both friendly and not friendly to I.D.), and brilliant video-footage of the relevant sites and fossils. Darwin's Dilemma is worth seeing for this purpose at the very least.

[1]Should you think special creationism (Old earth or not) patently absurd, note that plenty of I.D. proponents agree with you: A fair amount accept common descent, a fair amount reject the Bible, and some aren't even theists! The only thing that draws them together is that they feel a design inference is warranted in biology.
