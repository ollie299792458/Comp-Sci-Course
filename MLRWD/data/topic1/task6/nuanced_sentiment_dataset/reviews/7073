This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. I was a BIG fan of Mortal Kombat the game. I was an even bigger fan after I saw Mortal Kombat the movie! I was SO excited when I heard they were making this movie. But after I saw it I didn't care if I ever played the game ever again. The first movie was perfect. I don't know what they were thinking with this movie. At one point a mountain is supposed to blow up. It is SO obvious that it is just a small mound of dirt they built up and then blew up. Every single special effect used is horrible. To top that off is the horrible actors brought in. The first Rayden was perfect. This new Rayden is a joke. He even tells jokes. He tells one stupid joke after another. And then you have Jax. He's pretty good when he has his metal arms. But in the end they are ripped off. You would think that would be cool except his real arms are underneath! They weren't robot arms at all! Just metal gloves! Then you have Shao Kahn. Possibly the WORST part of the movie. He's just some white guy. There's nothing scary about him. He's not huge and he's not scary. He's just a normal white guy. He looks NOTHING like he did in the first Mortal Kombat movie. This movie was a HUGE mistake. It hurt Midway badly. I heard they were making yet another Mortal Kombat movie. I'll go see it if it doesn't look like the junk this movie turned out to be.
