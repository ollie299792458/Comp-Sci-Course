I have to say that this movie did have its good points, to any women reading this review, Paul Walker and Van Diesel are HOT! The cars are cool and the racing rocks (though stupid and should only be in a Hollywood movie and not on "real" streets)! I have to admit that the plot is pretty much non-existant and some scenes could have been left on the cutting room floor. I gave this movie 3 stars because;
1) The cars are really cool!
2) Paul Walker and Van Diesel are hot! and
3) You have to give credit where credit is due, it was a well filmed movie and the camera angles were also very well done, (I work with filming TV and so I see little mistakes in everything, but this one I saw hardly anything. That gives it a thumbs up from me).
I realise some of my stuff is bias but I actually liked the movie. So for what its worth, if you go to your local video store and buy a "previously viewed" version for $15 or less its a good movie.
But please, DO NOT TRY ANY OF THE STUNTS AT HOME! Because if that's your plan than don't bother watching it. Thank you and good night!
