Note that the actor Albert Popwell, whom Harry rehearses the "Do You Feel Lucky?" bit with, also appears in "Magnum Force" (as a pimp), "The Enforcer" (forgot who he played), and "Sudden  Impact" (as Harry's pal who gives him the bulldog). I don't remember  if he was in "Dead Pool" or not. What I'm really getting at is  this: they need to hurry up and release the other "Dirty Harry"  pictures on DVD. They deserve to be seen in their theatrical aspect ratio,  especially "Magnum", "Enforcer", and "Sudden  Impact" since they were shot in 235. And I can't believe they haven't  put out "Sudden Impact" already! That movie was a monster back in  '83. I can still remember all the a--holes in town going around saying  "Make My Day." So, go ahead, Warner Brothers, release 'em out of  sequence, and ask Mr. Eastwood to contribute a director's commentary to at  least one of his films for DVD--perhaps the underrated "Perfect  World."
