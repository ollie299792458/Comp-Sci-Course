How could it be that Bram Stoker wouldn't allow the film "Nosferatu" to use the name Dracula, but this slapdash haphazard piece of pulp is allowed to use the name Dracula?  
Imagine a world where everyone is 25 years old, except the undead Dracula, oh wait he's 25 years old too...he's also actually the reincarnation of...erm...the treacherous Judas of Biblical fame trying to seduce the reincarnation of the Virgin Mary (also of Biblical fame).  
I'm not really sure how Judas is supposed to be Dracula or vice-versa, but the whole thing is shoddy, ridiculous, and only works because it's setup to look like an MTV music video.  The problem with horror movies is there always seems to be the need to be campy and hoaky.  Everyone eventually grows fangs, jumps around the room wearing a cape, and trying to bite other people's necks.  Absurd.  
Maybe i'm expecting too much.  But this movie is a huge disappointment if you're looking for anything more than a campy horror flick.  Duly note that this has nothing to do with Bram Stoker's Dracula.
