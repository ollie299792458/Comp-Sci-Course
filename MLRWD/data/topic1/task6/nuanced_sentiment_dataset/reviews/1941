just like with his original sequel to The Mummy, the director, Stephen Sommers, makes a critical error in my opinion which competely detracts from the enjoyment and hurts our ability to immerse ourselves in the fun of the movie-- he throws in far too much humor, most of it not funny... what he doesnt understand is that we WANT to lose ourselves in the movie, we want to, for a couple hours, throw away the cynicism and believe in the world that he often effectively creates... but this is impossible when you have a child who is as bad as any sitcom creation, running around throwing out implausible wisecracks even when threatened with death (which I just about wished upon him later in the movie)... when Brandon Fraser's wife is kidnapped, even that doesn't stop the idiotic parade of humor--how can you believe in the situations when the remarks keep reminding you that it's just a movie?... note to Sommers--watch Indiana Jones for the 10th time and this time, take note that it's balance of humor to action/suspense was far more believable--when the Ark of the Covenenant cover came off that was no laughing matter--characters were scared, (and so were we, because we bought into it) without a stupid wisecrack in sight...
