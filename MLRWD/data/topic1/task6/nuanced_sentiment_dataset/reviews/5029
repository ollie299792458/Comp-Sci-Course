THE SUN ALSO RISES is a handsomely produced, but ultimately pointless film. It serves as yet another example of how Hemingway's work rarely translates onto the silver screen. Tyrone Power, Ava Gardner (beginning to look bloated from excessive drinking), Errol Flynn (the poster child of bloatedness from excessive drinking), and Eddie Albert (bloated, but not from alcohol) play a bunch of literate types who lounge about various western European locales drinking (not much of a stretch for Gardner and Flynn here) and moping and whining. Each male character increases his drinking, moping, and whining when left by Gardner for another male rival. This more or less describes what drags on over the course of 2+ hours. The real stars here are the European scenery and Cinemascope, which captures and conveys the grandeur and glory of the film's setting. Other than that, the only other value of the movie is the vivid illustration it provides of why Robert Evans' acting career was so short lived. His open-mouthed, blank stares while waiting for the bull charges almost inadvertently redeem this bland flick. To some extent, watching THE SUN ALSO RISES might be a case of life imitating art, since it will likely inspire its audience to drink, mope, and whine after enduring its pointlessness.
