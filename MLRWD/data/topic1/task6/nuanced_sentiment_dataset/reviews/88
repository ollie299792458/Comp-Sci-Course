One Saturday, I was trying to find a movie to go see that I hadn't already seen.  I came across "Bernie" and was surprised to see such positive reviews!  I hadn't heard of the movie.  Unfortunately, it wasn't playing at the local mega-plex, but only at a couple smaller theaters in town.  Not only did I enjoy this movie, I also have seen it several times, taking other family and friends to see it as well! I also have a new appreciation for independent theaters and have found that they offer some great movies.

Jack Black does a great job depicting Bernie Thiede.  Shirley MacLaine portrays Marjorie Nugent brilliantly.  Matthew McConaughey is almost unrecognizable as the prosecuting attorney, Danny Buck Davidson.  Look for great performances from his mother, Kay McConaughey, Sonny Carl Davis (love him!), and Kay Epperson, who steals every scene she is in!

What makes this movie so enjoyable are the local citizens that are cast in the movie.  Also, don't make the mistake of turning off the movie when the credits start to roll - make sure you keep watching, so you don't miss a few extra scenes and music!

If you haven't heard about the true story and events from Carthage, Texas, in 1996, do yourself a favor and watch the movie first. There are plenty of articles you can read afterwards, including the one by Skip Hollandsworth, "Midnight in the Garden of East Texas" from 1998 Texas Monthly, which served as the basis for the screenplay.
