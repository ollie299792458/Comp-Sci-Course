...and this one is no different but that's what is FUN about these old black and white "monster" movies!  I just love them.  This one has fond memories linked with it -- when my best friend and I  were about 5 or 6 years old, and I was spending the night at her house, we were laying on the floor with our bed pillows at her house one Friday night - staying way up past our bedtime watching "Shock Theater"......this one came on and we were so terrified of that giant bubble following that lady around.  Ahh, the good old days.  The movie overall is pretty bad, the special effects are really bad (especially the giant rubbery hand reaching out) - and just HOW does that 50 foot tall woman still fit in her house after she's gotten so tall?  I also would like to know how the sheets were big enough to make clothes for her.  Must have been some big bed she had!  This is just for fun -- just like all the other cult classic monster movies -- just sit back, relax and don't expect anything like today's special effects - just have fun with it!
