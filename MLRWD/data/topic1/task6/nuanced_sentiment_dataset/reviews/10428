A couple of people recommend this film to me and I noticed some decent reviews for it.  I'm not sure if they thought it was good in comparison to some of the other After Dark Horror Fest movies or what, but I thought this was a snooze fest.

I'll admit to not being the biggest fan of ghost stories, at least when it comes to movies.  I was willing to give this one a chance because the premise sounded interesting enough.  Almost like a Christmas Carol with a horror twist on it.  My main problem with the movie was the fact that the ghosts weren't all that interesting, aside from the rapist priest.  The majority of the time the victims would just be tossed around or beat up by the ghosts....not quite scary.  I also didn't like the fact that the ghosts faces looked too much like masks.  They were creepy looking, but also very "fake" looking as well.

Overall the movie really didn't do much for me.  The characters were kind of annoying, so I didn't really care what fate had in store for them.  The scares were also pretty minimal.  I'd recommend this as a $1 rental if you're bored one day or are intent on seeing all the After Dark films.  Go check out "Borderlands" or "Frontiers" instead, they show off what the After Dark Horror Fest series really has to offer.
