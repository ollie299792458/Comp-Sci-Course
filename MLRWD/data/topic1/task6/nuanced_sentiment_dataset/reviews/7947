Ordered this title for my growing Blu ray collection as I really enjoyed this movie on theatrical release and DVD. Took nearly a month to get to me(I live in New Zealand) but was a couple of weeks earlier than Amazon had estimated so a bonus I guess.
I found this Blu ray version of JFK to be of very average quality picture wise but rather than blame a poor transfer I think it was more to do with Stone wanting to invite the viewer into to an emotional laden storyline than worrying how good this movie would look in 1080p.(Of course Blu ray was not mainstream when this movie was released) but as this version was released in 2011 it perhaps couldve been a chance for Warner Bros to really give this film the once over that I believed it deserves.
The 5.1 Dolby THD soundtrack is also of average quality but better than my DVD version but there seems to be a small technical glitch where the sound and picture appear out of sync in several key scenes of the movie. I have a 2011 Panasonic Blu ray player and a PS3 and it did this on both machines so maybe its due to the fact of a poor soundtrack transfer Im not sure but Im not impressed.
Overall Im glad I have this movie in my collection now(Currently not available for retail in New Zealand at this point of time) however I do believe that this version could've had benefitted so much more from a decent remaster(picture and soundwise)to enhance what is an enjoyable watch and arguably a great movie.
