I sat down to watch this movie one weekend shortly after reading the famous novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I was expecting this great movie after reading the reviews and I am very suprised that most people liked this version. I guess I am one of those people who would like the movie to stay close to the the book's original plot UNLESS the movie can be done better. (The Godfather and Forrest Gump come to mind)
The movie's aura is pure technicolor. I was expecting better from a dvd version. The sets looks cheesy and fake- the plastic rocks and the painted background. I was hoping for the English countryside not a Hollywood soundstage. (Perhaps like the beautiful yet mysterious moors at the beginning of An American Werewolf in London?)
Speaking of large scary/ghostly creatures, in this movie version you can barely hear the howl of the hound, it is barely audible in the background. The estate of the Baskervilles looks like a log cabin inside. The actors in this movie are just miscast with the exception of the man who plays Watson. Sherlock is portrayed as short and sniveling. The young butler who is a key suspect in the book is now an old man. The rest of the cast don't do justice to the characters in the book.

The movie completely rearranges the sequence and takes out major scenes like the chase scene involving Sherlock and the mysterious yet sinister man in horse-driven cab in the city. A tarantula instead appears out of nowhere in this movie. There are also some characters missing.

I got so angry and dizzy at all the switcheroos the movie was committing and the slow pace duriung the middle act that I never watched the 3rd act. I'm still amazed some consider this the best version of the novel-now thats' scary.

Go ahead and give me a not helpful vote b/cI stated my opinion but if you want to see a great Sherlock Holmes then watch the Jeremy Brett series that blows this one out of the water.
