Oh yeah; the jets roar, the top gun aces sass and swagger and the script trips and plops out such memorable quoters as: "you can be my wing man anytime" . . . (right up there with Kirk Douglas's Spartacus snarling at Crassus' legions: "they can't stop men who wan't to be free", etc.); well, news is, they can stop men who want to be free; they can do that by casting Kelly McGillis up against the very short Tom Cruise (Maverick); they can hope for something like charisma, sexual tension, animal magnetism or just good ole fashion' lust on the tarmac; but, no dice; it just don't happen; the best (and only) love affair in this hot-to-be-liked Tony Scott film is that between tiny Tom and Anthony Edwards (E.R.'s favorite bald surgeon); oh, yeah -- those two bohunks click; as does Val Kilmer's Iceman -- the nerves of steel by the books hot shot who will probably wind up marrying Ollie North's daughter and running for Congress (note: please, do not let me see him wearing towel only ever again -- his is a torso only Ben Kingsley in Gandhi outdoes); but back to Top Gun; yes, that's Meg Ryan as Anthony Edwards' wife/widow; it is one of her best parts; you can almost like her; Tom Skerritt, who is never forgettable in any part, looks as if he wishes his mustache were on Tom Cruise (who, if he had a mustache, might look old enough to sign up for his own paper route); Michael Ironside doesn't know if Cruise/Maverick will ever shape into the ace of aces we all know he has to become if the film is to end; and end it does; all is well in the azure skies of freedom and at Top Gun school in Miramar, CA; the juke box plays "You've Lost That Lovin Feelin'" as Kelly and Tom reunite; I hope they don't have kids; or, if they do, the kids avoid this movie; just kidding; there are great aerial scenes and then there are great landing and take-off scenes; I like the jet trails too; and the overplayed Berlin song, "Take My Breath Away", which should have been bought up by Certs or Listerine or a Mexican Restaurant chain; oh well, there is no irony in popular movies any more; wait for the trading cards.
