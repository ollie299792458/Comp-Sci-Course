Premise: Andie (Kate Hudson), a writer for a frou-frou New York fashion magazine, is researching a story on all the little, almost unconscious things that women do to drive away the men they love. Ben (Matthew McConaughey), a competitive advertising executive, is trying to win a bet that he can get ANY woman to fall in love with him in order to secure a pitch for a huge diamond account. The timeline for both of our leads? Ten days. Of course, the two unwittingly fall for each other, which makes for some interesting fireworks once truths on both sides are eventually revealed.

Lighthearted and fun, McConaughey and Hudson make a beautiful couple with no small amount of onscreen chemistry. I hadn't seen McConaughey in a role I liked him so well in since Contact. He displays plenty of confidence and cocky charm, and flashes his trademark smile often enough to keep you interested. The only scene that really didn't work for me was near the end, at a swank dinner party, once both girl and boy discover one another's true motivations. A particularly bad karaoke performance was not the tool I would have chosen for them to vent their frustrations. Other than that, though, it was both entertaining and endearing.
