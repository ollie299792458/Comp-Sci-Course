Only on the 2nd time around seeing this one did I notice JLC's line to her boyfriend (?) that Michael killed some of her friends 20 yrs ago.  Not a mention of the events of sequels 4,5,6.  This was dissapointing to  me because it's like 4,5 and 6 didn't happen.  My beef here isn't that those were good or bad sequels (reading here clearly indicates alot of people dissatisfied with 4,5,6)  but that the events were not even worth noting.  Conceded.....the real Halloween storyline is LAURIE vs. MICHAEL MYERS however.....in 4,5 and 6 who was the "boogeyman"?  It was Michael Myers.  In 4,5 and 6 where did it take place?  It was HADDONFIELD (not Santa Mira!).  What is one "small thing" that 1,2,4,5,6 have in common?  DONALD PLEASANCE!--no reference to him in H20 was there?  Remember in JAWS 2 they mentioned Matt Hooper (r. dryefuss)when the new Shark appeared in Amity?.....(Pleasance was as much the spirit (if not more) of those films as JLC was in the first 2 - funny we get a PSYCHO references but none of him).  Jamie Lloyd was who?  Oh my gosh...Laurie Strode's daughter...and was not mentioned.  I thought the Thorn cult idea was eerie and mysterious and could have been persued in any sequel after H6.  If the ideas behind the film were to distance itself from 4,5,6 because of negative feedback on those films at least they could have threaded the storyline from those along into H20 if at least in reference. I didn't dislike the film totally because  I am and remain a fan of the series but gaffs like that are hard to ignore.  And this is but one man's opinion.
