1 star isn't enough, in my view, in terms of a low rating for this movie... I don't know WHAT film it is tha the 5 star reviewers were watching, but i gotta tell you, this one ain't it...! If ever a wrong tree was barked up dear, this film's it!

The character references are brilliant, & the film could have gone somewhere... Instead of really bringing the story line together, the characters portrayed by the actors are SO damned disattched from one another, you could place them on opposite poles of the planet... The story... Hmmm... I don't think there's meant to be one... Well, not from what has been given in the film.

I think the director just got up one morning and said: "I want glitz, I want glamour, colourful characters & set, I want gay guys dressed as women, an alcoholic, a tragic queen, a prospective actor, & a man whose bank account is larger then his endowment & a love triangle involving the 4 characters mentioned... To top it all off, I want them in the same movie all together..."

Listen, here's what i think, whatever this movie was trying to achieve, it hasn't... It falls short in EVRY way I have tried to think of how it all adds up... There's just no saving it...

There's a LOT of funnier gay films out there, (Might i even suggest "Is It Just Me" and "Another Gay Movie"), And this one doesn't even classify as comedy... Its more arthouse, or something else... Come to think of it, Arthouse is WAY too kind for this film... Its a class of its own...

Hated every minute, its not funny, and its not worth the purchase...
