Since I got the first one DVD and got some insight into Kenneth Johnson's mind concerning the second part, I doubt I will look at The Final Battle the same way again.  Don't get me wrong however, it's still a masterpiece in it's own right.  You can definitely tell though that Warner was making a step in the wrong direction.  Waaaay too much fantasy and far-reaching exploits than I would like to believe.  Once the weekly series hit the ground, it didn't run....it stumbled and fell into the quicksand better known as cancellation.  I was quite surprised of the lengthy run it DID have on TV.  Regardless....this is probably the last good memory that we can have of it on record (I suppose I could throw in the season debut for the actual weekly series which I thought was done marginally) and now we can enjoy it in the most popular format.  I can accuse Warner Home Video of one thing:  not taking the time to put serious quality into the production of the DVD.  Ken Johnson meticuously went over the original audio tracks, digitally enhanced them and remixed them to give it an updated fuller sound than ever experienced.  Here, we are handed Dolby Digital 2.0 and a "just deal with it" card.  Prehaps they might release a Criterion Edition and make up for lost quality.  I also believe that there would at least be more behind-the-scenes footage to mete out than what has been done in the past.  I could go on and on about this but I won't.  Simply buy it to complete and continue the Original Miniseries and that's it.
