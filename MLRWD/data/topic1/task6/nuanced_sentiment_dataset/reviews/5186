I absolutely loved this movie when I was young (and still do), so naturally when I saw it was released on DVD I purchase it.  The video quality of this DVD is absolutely superb!  They did a decent job of translating this movie to DVD.  However, the reason I'm giving it two stars is because of the movie's horrible voice-overs.  Apparently some of the audio has been lost over the years; consequently Disney needed to add in voice acting in places where the dialogue is missing.  (it starts appearing about midway through)  So what's wrong with voice-overs?  Nothing if they are done right.  However, Disney spent a whole five minutes on these.  They are absolutely *horrid*!  They do not sync up with the actors lips and in 90% of the shots they don't even sound like the original voice.  The least they could have done was try to make the voices sync with the lip movements.  So do I recommend this DVD?  Personally, I would say no.  Disney needs to stay away from redoing old movies.  However, if you can stand horrible voice-overs through the second half of the movie then by all means buy it!  It's still a great movie despite what they've done to it!  Worth at least a rental to see if you like it.
