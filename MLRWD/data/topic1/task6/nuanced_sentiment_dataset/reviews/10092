John Steinbeck's novel Of Mice And Men was first adapted to big screen in 1939. But there were two more remakes following this first version by Burgess Meredith.

In 1992 Gary Sinise directed the latest version in which he himself plays George, an intelligent, hard-working man who takes care of Lennie, his intellectually handicapped friend.

Lennie is a really warm-hearted childish guy who has a soft spot for petting soft things. He always says: 'I wanna tend the rabbits', which makes him appear like someone who cannot even harm a fly. But his inability to handle his strength gets him into trouble several times. John Malkovich (Lennie) did a great job in playing this simple-mindedness but I imagined Lennie as being a bit more amusing. In the scenes in which he wants George to tell him the story about their future (`We'll live on the fatta the land, that's it George!'), Malkovich's acting doesn't excite enough empathy, which was disappointing.

But this flaw is made up for by the beautiful countryside which is shown exactly like it is described in the book. The great camera movement enables you to experience the life on an ordinary American ranch. It seems so close that you can almost smell the hay in the burning sun.

Moreover, the `down the farm' dialect underlines the simplicity of the circumstances people lived in these days.

To my mind the mis-en-scene was very well done because it corresponded almost to all of my expactations after reading the book.

That's why I would say that Sinise has successfully turned John Steinbeck's story into an entertaining movie which is a masterpiece in it's own right.
