I rented this movie from Blockbuster last night, and I am kind of glad that I did because this movie was damn right good. Of course I plan to buy this film, but I am here to write a review and here it is. Mr.Washington plays a detective named John Hobbs, he captures a cold harded killer named Edgar Reese, and he witnesses his execution.
 But this is where it get's creepy, his soul escapes his body, and transfer's to a guard who released the gas. See Edgar Reese killed his victims, but he was controlled by a demon, and Edgar was not in his right space of mind, he was used like a puppet.
 So as the demon then moves around to find other victims for it's sick game, the killings begin, the first person to kill someone always left a bowl of sugar, a box of cereal with sugar on it, and the bowl of cereal all align together.
 Now as John finds out the truth, with the clues left my the killer, he then finds out about the demon and tries to stop it.
 The movie is VERY good, and the best thing about is that, IT HAS NO GORE unlike other films like Slience of The Lambs, Hannibal, and Red Dragon just to name a few. So rent this or buy it and you wont regret it.
