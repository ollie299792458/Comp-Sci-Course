A nice traditional middle of the road comedy set in Greece with beautiful scenery.  Some classic characters are mixed together (Vardalos as the 30-something smart single woman looking for Mr Right), a hunky guy for her (the bus driver), a twit/dweeb who gets his comeuppance (Niko, the other tour guide at the company), a slacker 18 year old not sure what country he's in.  There is also a spot-on icy grumpy 40ish British wife.  Real surprises come from a 70-something little old English lady who is a superbly skilled pickpocket - always a giggle and a treat when she has a scene.  Also Brian Palermo has a small role as an IHOP executive constantly talking about pancakes.  But Palmero is also a writer and a top-flight improv comedian, and there are some wonderful 'extra' out-takes where Palmermo creates a series of improv scenes playing the pancake-fixated IHOP executive in a dozen extemporaneous variations.  ("If I wanted to see normal people, I'd go back to Utah" he riffs, and we hear the director yell CUT!).  Personally I felt the first half was more engaging and witty than the second, but overall it's very watchable and a fun effort.  I was prepared not to like it ("chick flick", I thought) and found alot of it very witty.
