I liked the book and HATE the movie... I say hate because I am currently in the middle of it on demand and had to stop because it was so painful to watch. They made to many changes that I didn't agree with and then parts that I would have expected to see... the visions of home, the story of why they are after them in the first place, none of it was really there.

The biggest complaint I have is the relationship between Henri and John is NOTHING like the book. In the book the part I LOVED was the loving honest relationship between them and in the movie hes just a brat kid who wont do what hes told. Not to mention that they only look to be about a 10 year age difference in the characters. In the beginning when I first saw Henri I was like really?...who would think thats his dad?

(Spoiler Alert)
Then the way they portray Sam, like a kid that ONLY SOMETIMES has a problem with his fathers alien abductors... He knows John is an alien and yet just texts him and says "Hey come on over I know what you are" and they talk??? In the book Sam is scared out of his mind and with good reason... he just found out that his friend is an ALIEN... as far as he knows could be the ones who abduct his father.
(Spoiler over)

Geeze very disappointing so far.

I hope to be able to change my review but so far this is a total waste of money and time.
