Is this a great movie? No. Does this movie show kids as they really are,as some say? Not exactly.
What this is,is a film that tries to portray teens in  a true light,but doesn't quite succeed all of the time.
The plot:  Aids infected teen has unprotected sex with teen girl,does some drugs,  drinks some alcohol,has a few violent moments and has unprotected sex again  with different teen girl. Honestly,thats it.
I give this movie credit for  trying,not for succeeding. No,teenagers are not angels,as we all know. They  do make mistakes,sometimes deadly ones. To a certain extent this movie  portrays teens as they can be. But is this how they really are? Well,just a  few short years out of my teens and working with teens on a daily basis,I  can honestly say,no,I don't believe this is how teens are. 
Yes,this film  is gritty,yes,this film is disturbing,yes,this film will leave you stunned.  Stunned at the way America views it's youth and stunned that our youth are  willing to embrace the actions portrayed in this film.
