This is one of the most pathetic movies to watch-yet whenever my Brother and I watch it we have the biggest laughs together.
Dennis Quaid is older Mike Brody and some other dude is Sean, (not a bad actor). They are running the new Sea World in Florida. And after having fun, along comes ..... Jaws 3. AIEEEEE !!! 
Such a big turd at now 35 feet, she roams the area in search of revenge after the people of the facility accidently killed her 15 ft baby. So, here she comes...and the shark is huge ! Blue screen FX are so awful....watching her big butt swimming across the screen is hilarious. The script is so 80's typical...a NEW AGE theme park  and they become food for ... JAWS 3 !! Aieeeeee.....blubblub....crunch.....munch....
Unbelievably after winning an Oscar, Louis Gossit Jr. has the guts to star in such a dump of a movie? HAHAHAHA
The funniest part is when the little girl spots Jaws coming towards their underwater plexiglass view window and says, "Look daddy...loooook!" And without chaging his dull and bored facial expression yet changing his voice, he yells so loud, "Holy ...."
Imagine sounding so scared, swearing , yet looking half asleep?? So much laughs all day with that scene.
Rotten-rotten movie...but full of "THIS IS SUCH A GARBAGE MOVIE" laughs.
