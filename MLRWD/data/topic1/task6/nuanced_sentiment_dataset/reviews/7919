This is not a full review but a comment on one aspect of the film that struck me. Prot gives one of the patients three tasks that will "cure" him if he succeeds. 1. Find the bluebird of happiness. 2. Experience death. This one's complicated, but the patient strangles another almost to death which, in turn, awakens this "victim" to our powerlessness over mortality. 3. Stay here and be prepared for anything (referencing the hospital and a warning about expecting the unknown, be it tragic or joyful.)

These are the three tasks Prot himself is subjected to/embarks on. His marriage and family were his bluebird. The murder he encounters and the one he commits are #2. #3 he becomes a numbed but non-delusional wheelchair bound Robert again...he stays and may well be prepared for anything.

Yet Ellen, I think that was her name, is unaccounted for. This adds the twist of uncertainty about where conventional reality and our individual perceptions of reality may co-exist even if seemingly in conflict.  Was Prot happier recreating his reality whereby, as an alien from a planet where there weren't even any families to lose, he could not have lost his family in the first place, annd therefore will not have to go through the painful stages leading to acceptance?

Extraordinary minds and hearts build elaborate castles of denial to avoid pain.

This is a very moving film.
