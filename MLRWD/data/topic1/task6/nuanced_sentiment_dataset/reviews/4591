I loved every minute of this film when I saw it in my local movie house when I was a kid.  I bought the DVD to regain old magic.  It just wasn't there.  The filming on a sound stage is not a problem, especially when you think the whole premise of Brigadoon is a fantasy.  But Gene Kelly really doesn't sing very well and his acting talent is minimal at best. Van Johnson is under utilized in this movie, but his performance is so under nuanced it is kind of embarrassing.  I know he was a better actor than you see in this movie.
My biggest disappointment was the choice by Vincent Minelli to cut "Come to Me, Bend to Me" out of the final production.  You can watch it in the outtakes and I guess it was eliminated because it is sung by a secondary character (but a much better singer than Gene Kelly.)
For me, the most fun was the ensemble number, "Bonnie Jean."  Watching Kelly and Johnson doing a soft shoe was worth the whole movie.Watching Kelly sand dance to "Almost Like Being in Love" is almost as good.
Cyd Charisse looks lovely, dances divinely and is totally out of place as a Scottish lass, but that was Hollywood.
The movie is a period piece from a time when Scotland, heather, and Hollywood were all as unattainable and magical  as a sophisticated nightclub in New York City.  I think this is the real charm of this movie, the memory of our innocence.
