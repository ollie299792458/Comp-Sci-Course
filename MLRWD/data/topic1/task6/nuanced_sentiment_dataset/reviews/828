Years ago I met the producers of this film when it was just a dream in their imaginations.  They are to be congratulated for pulling it off!  It took me far too long to see the film, and I truly enjoyed it.  Yes, the visual effects really are amazing! The film was moving, and I look forward to watching it again and checking out the DVD so many have mentioned.  The extremes in ratings were entertaining to read.  It was interesting to read the references to CS Lewis, Monteverdi's Orfeo, and William Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell.  What nobody has mentioned is that the heaven and hell scenes are based on Emmanuel Swedenborg's visions in his book, Heaven and Hell.  A Swedish genius in the 1700's, Swedenborg is a mystic and understands the dynamics of living systems, having first been a mechanical engineering genius, before developing his unusual and fascinating theology.  Blake was one of the signers of the charter for the first Swedenborg Church in London, by the way, and Swedenborg influenced Wordsworth, Yeats, John Muir, Emerson, Thoreau, Helen Keller, Mary Baker Eddy, Carl Jung, and others. Another favorite film, about spirituality and romance, otherwise entirely different, is Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire.
