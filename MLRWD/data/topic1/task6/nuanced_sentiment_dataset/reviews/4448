People, people, people!  Please!  I was reading some of the reviews for this movie.  Seems some people rented/got this movie to "discover" those ancient secrets of such secret society or the Skulls and Bones.  You really think they'll reveal them here?

Anyways, Luke is offered a chance to join the Skulls.  The thing is that Luke is different from the other pledge brothers.  He isn't a legacy nor does he come from old money.  So, this is a rare opportunity of a lifetime.

In the middle of pledging or initiation rites, Luke discovers that his best friend, a student journalist, has committed suicide.  Or was he staged to look like he committed suicide.  Immediately, he suspects the Skulls.  In a freakish way, the Skulls seems to know what Luke is thinking and doing.

Luke wants to back out and report the society of its involvement of a friend's death to the police.  However, wherever he turns, there's a Skull blocking his way.  Will Luke be able to avenge his friend's death?

Think of *The Skulls* as a collegiate version of *The Firm*.
