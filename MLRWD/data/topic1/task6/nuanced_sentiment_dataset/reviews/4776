Since THE PRAYER OF JABEZ is featured on secular best-seller lists, it should be readily apparent that it isn't a book about sacrifice or service.  Sure enough--this lenghty pamphlet is really little more than a materialistic "name it and claim it" ideology disguised as a meditation on an obscure Old Testament prayer to give it a veneer of credibility.  The author's suggestion that the prayer of Jabez "works" and if we recite it "daily" we will see "blessings" reveals the secular nature of his spiritual life.  God is not an idol to be manipulated to serve our desires.  Forget the prayer of Jabez.  If one REALLY wants to recite a daily prayer, make it the Lord's prayer: "Our Father in heaven, holy is your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. Do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the Evil one. Amen."  Why didn't Wilkinson use this prayer as the basis for a book? Simple: Asking God for our daily bread is never as popular as asking him to shower us with unimaginable blessings.
