When I was 12, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie The Tracey Fragments (even though it has received a good amount of bad reviews). It was like I had been waiting all my life to see it - to know that someone else in the world could be having the same crazy things I had experienced..and to know it's sometimes alright to feel hateful, ungrateful, and depressed. This was because I found the situations, characters, and emotions GENUINE. My point is that Fish Tank failed to live up to my expectations.

I cannot remember all the reasons why Fish Tank doesn't appeal to me, so I will simply refute its laudatory reviews and anything else I find overrated.
-Just because a teenager lives in a not-so-nice building, enjoys drinking, and dropped out of schools does NOT mean that she is a "victim." To be honest, I was upset/jealous at how nice her room looked, how casual her mom was, how she owned so much money to buy booze all the time (plus her clothes and music player), and mostly how she could practically do whatever without her parent calling the police on her or nagging 24/7.
-Mia is definitely not a "passionate street dancer." She just sways around unsynchronized with the music and doesn't seem to work hard on anything. I thought it was hypocritical that she messed with those other dancing girls and kept on chuckling whenever her mom's boyfriend kept on saying "I think you're great." Watch Take the Lead if you like lower-class, teenage dancers.
-What was she thinking when she tried to "rescue" the white horse? Let it run away and either get captured again or starve to death?
-It is uncertain that Mia had a "rough" childhood because she seems to frequently roughen her little sister's childhood. If she really knew how arduous it was to grow up and cared for her sister like at the end of the movie, there would not be a detached attitude between them.
-Why does Mia keep on messing with others? She seems to have never been slapped, robbed, or threatened with a weapon.

To finish for now, I cannot sympathize with Mia or the lack of depth in the storyline. Viewers are left without understanding why each character acted the way he or she did.
