I have actually seen this movie twice- once in England, and here in California.  When I first watched it in England, me and my English friend barely paid attention to the thing after the first half hour- we would laugh derisively at Al Pacino's accent, or Donald Sutherland's accent, or the accent of the fruity English lord who got stabbed in the crotch with a hairpin.  Mostly it was just picturesque historical wallpaper, playing harmlessly in the background while we discussed where we were going out drinking that night.  This might give you an idea how engrossing this movie is.  However, it is very pretty in parts- and my recollection of the pretty scenes was enough incentive for me to watch it a second time a few months ago.  On the second viewing, though, I was reminded forcibly that the script has holes big enough to drive a Mac truck through, and the characters are universally tiresome- and not particularly believable, either.  Natassja Kinski announces she's leaving her rich Tory family in New York, and in the next scene she shows up in Valley Forge (near Philadelphia).  How, I wondered, did she travel all that distance, in wartime, in the 18th century?  Did she just jump on the bus?  Or perhaps she took the latest flight from La Guardia?  Whatever... this is Hollywood.  Whoever said movies had to make sense? (Ms. Kinski still looks fetching in a low cut dress, no matter how she got to Valley Forge.)  I suppose there are worse films out there, but as epics go, this is certainly no "Lawrence of Arabia."  Where's David Lean when you really need him!
