Wasn't the best 3D.  Bought it based on all of the 5 stars, but have to give it a 3.2ish.  Yes, the enviro-beatdown is SOOOO annoying...felt like I was watching a really long Prius commercial.  I understand what climate change does to the ocean, just don't guilt-trip the audience.  And, Jim Carry's audio track was too low compared to the music track making me use the sub-titles, which really screwed up my 3D experience-they were in front of some subjects and very distorting.  Also distorting was the concave window which the crew shot through from the submarine.  The bottom corners of the screen were rounded and were screwing up my eyes.

And TONS of ghosting.

There were some outstanding shots-the Potato Cod was, by far, the best single 3D shot I've seen on my TV...SERIOUSLY in my face from about 8 to 10 feet away. Honorable mentions to the Eel farm and Sea Snakes.  But those were the highlights.  I really think of the IMAX 3D's I've seen, the best was Hubble 3D.  Great documentary and incredible 3D production.
