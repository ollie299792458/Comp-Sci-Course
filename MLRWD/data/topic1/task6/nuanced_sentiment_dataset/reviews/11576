OK guys, this was not meant to be Citizen Kane.  Simply put, this is just a silly, fun movie.  Like any Looney Tunes project, they throw out a ton of gags, and some work and some don't.  The movie is probably best for those of us who grew up watching Bugs and Daffy and company, to enjoy some nostalgic fun.  A lot of the humor will be lost on the kids, particularly as the movie and its actors make fun of themselves and political correctness.  Star Brendan Fraser leads the way, making fun of that actor named Brendan Fraser.  The tunes characters get in on it, with an updated twist.  Mindful of all the complaints about the violence in the cartoons, one of the bad guys refuses to throw dynamite that is about to explode, worrying that he will be sending the wrong message to children.  Porky and Speedy Gonzalez are having lunch, bemoaning what political correctness has done to their careers.  Jenna Elfman (Dharma from Dharma and Greg) has a hard time adjusting to the tunes, at one point lamenting "who carries dynamite?!?!"  At one point, Bugs does the thing of transforming himself into the heavily made-up woman.  Jenna chides Bugs that it was funny back when, but was distrubing now.  That air of what the characters are not allowed to do or to be in these super-sensitive times is ever-present.  Still, they do manage to create lots of obvious gags and some of the adult humor the toons were known for (e.g., a mad chase through the paitings in the Lourve, where Elmer is transformed into The Scream) and where the characters take on roles and qualities from the impressionists and surrealists.  Joan Cusak makes her inevitable and always excellent appearance.  Some fun, some nostalgia, some making fun of themselves and what society has become.  Not bad for a film based around the looney tunes and the evil of the Acme coroporation (headed by great comic and under-appreciated novelist, Steve Martin).
