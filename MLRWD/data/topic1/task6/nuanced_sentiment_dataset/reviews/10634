First of all, let me say that I'm not a prude, not a religious fanatic, not easily offended, and not lacking in a sense of humor. I also have an open mind and I'm not even averse to crude humor, a la South Park and Beavis and Butthead. So no one can blame my dislike of this movie on priggishness.
Put plain and simply, I found this movie unfunny. The best it managed to get from me was a couple of snickers, but that's it. I spent most of the movie wondering when it was going to start being funny, then turned it off in disgust after the internet exploitation scene. Even if I had liked the Jason Biggs character, that scene would've destroyed any liking I had. Sorry, but webcasting a young woman without her knowledge or consent isn't funny, nor is it something a decent, likeable person would do. If that scene had been omitted, I might not have hated this movie nearly as much.
The sad thing is, the movie might actually have had some potential in the right hands. As I've already said, I don't normally have a problem with crude humor; however, I do want my crude humor to be well done. The difference between this movie and something like, say, South Park is that South Park's humor is done with wit and charm. American Pie tried to have some charm, but the aforementioned internet scene gutted any heart it may have had. And as for wit...the gags here were so obvious the writers may as well have dropped anvils on the audience's head.
In the movie's favor, though, there was one surprise: the casting of Mena Suvari against type. Rather than have her play a beautiful, seductive type as might be expected, whoever did the casting gave her the role of a normal and likeable girl...although an extremely pretty one. That's really the only reason I'm not bellyaching that we can't rate a movie with negative stars.
