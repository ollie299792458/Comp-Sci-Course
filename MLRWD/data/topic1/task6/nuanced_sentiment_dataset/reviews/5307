I absolutely loved Steve Lopez's book, so I know I had high expectations when I went to see this movie.  What a disappointment!  I realize that a movie cannot always capture every nuance of a book, but the screenplay seemed choppy and rushed, as if the screenwriter couldn't decide what to focus on and the director just wanted to be done with it.  For me, it seemed that anytime the storyline got interesting, the film cut to another scene.  I was surprised by how boring and dry it was in some spots--very unlike the book--and at times thought the film would never end.  I went to see this movie in the theater because I liked Robert Downey, Jr.'s edgier roles and was curious to see his performance.  I thought he was miscast as Steve Lopez and felt that there was no real chemistry between Downey and Jamie Foxx, who can be a fine actor.  I was never completely convinced that a friendship developed between these two characters.  The one truly touching moment in the film, for me, came when a homeless woman explained how the voices she often hears comfort her and that she doesn't want to take lithium because it makes the voices go away.  Steve Lopez's book is so much more engrossing and inspirational, and certainly deserved better treatment than it received with this mediocre film.  This movie could have been so much more.  Skip it and read the book instead.
