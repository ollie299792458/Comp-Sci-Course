In a way, this movie is truer to the spirit of Burroughs' book than the big budget movie was. In the big budget movie, John Carter is a reluctant fighter, while in this movie and in the book, he is not. It wasn't the minimal budget and short shooting schedule that wrecked this movie, it was bizarre decisions they producer and director made. The attempt to modernize the beginning of the story where ridiculous, I'm sure many people turned it off right there. I admit to leaning toward the purist side, but that's not what this is about. Their modernization was just awful. If that were simply cut out, the move would be a lot better. The other bizarre thing is that they decided to disgust the audience with the food and drink John Carter is given. It is not disgusting at all in the book, they consume a plant which is something like a cactus. Why they made this choice is beyond me.

These are the millstones which sunk this movie. The acting could have been better, they could have cast a more convincing Dejah Thoris, but these are minor. Without the terrible choices at the beginning, this would have been a decent movie.
