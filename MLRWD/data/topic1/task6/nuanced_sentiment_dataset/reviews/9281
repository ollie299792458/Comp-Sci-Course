Big news! Dark Shadows the movies are coming to dvd this fall.
  I've been waiting for these two film to make it to disc for years. After
having worn out my vhs copies. While both films are good, HODS is the better
of the two. Being more faithful to the original storyline of how Barnabas Collins
came to Collinwood, and the tragic events that followed.
  NODS simply suffers from a badly scripted storyline. Due partly because filming
began only months after it was learn that the daytime soap was being cancelled.
Plus two of the lead stars in the tv show, Jonathan Frid and Joan Bennett had declined to do another big screen film. So it was decided to capitalize on David Selby's
popularity as Quintin Collins to create a new storyline.
  It starts with Quintin as a distant relation to the former owners of the great estate. Who inherits it after the last occupant dies. He is an artist who together with his wife Daphne, moves in to huge mansion to begin their new life.
  They find the place is cared for by a creepy housekeeper played by the late great
Grayson Hall. She begins to relates to them the sordid history of the place. Involving two
of Quintin's ancestors. One a namesake, and the other the wife of his brother, Angelique, who was accused of witchcraft tried and hanged. Anyway the story goes on from there. And unfortunately goes down from there! The big problem being that
35 minutes of explanatory storyline was cut from the film at the last minute.
  leaving the movie disjointed and uneven. A great disappointment.
But still somewhat enjoyable.
