Ok, so wtf. This movie is terrible. The devil's in a elevator? Give me a break. I actually saw this in the theatres. From the opening credits with the upside down...everything, I was like...oh boy. This is going to suck isn't it? I guess everythings upside down becaaaaaause, an upside down cross is satanic? Whatever. This is one awful movie. Did I say that already? The plot is jolted and quickly choppy and all the sudden you're in the elevator and things starting getting...crazy. And ridiculous. How about that ending? Is that some awful bullcrap or what? Messed up too. Some ho and boyfriend sitting of front us in the theatres was all like what the F? Out the F loud. Will you shut up? Really. But truly, I was thinking the same thing. Like, what the F indeed? Why did I waste my money and time to see this worthless piece of crap? And then it all comes together at the end with this other thing, and that is truly terrible. Terrible acting. Terrible story. Ridiculous characters. Ridiculous premise, first of all. It is absolutely staggering there's not more one star reviews on here. You'll notice it disappeared as quickly out of theatres as it came into it. Kind of like the devil himself. Hmmm, irony? Maybe you should buy some tarots with an oujia board and visit trump towers' elevators instead. After all you may spot the donald. You can spot his hair. And that would be dramatically more entertaining than even one sec of this movie.
