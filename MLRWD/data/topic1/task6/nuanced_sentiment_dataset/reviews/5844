We leave college and we grow as people.  "Buffy" goes to college and we see the show grow from a seedling to a tree in a summer.  This is the strongest series so far when it comes to writing, story telling, character development, philosophical depth and individual episodes.  Though it is the season people stopped watching (blame it on Marc Blucas if you must give someone the blame).  This season was the most lauded so far.  Hush nominated for an Emmy.  Living Conditions, Something Blue, Beer Bad, Superstar, A New Man show how funny the series is when it focuses on comedy and lets drama ride in the back.  But drama comes full swing in The Harsh Light of Day, which made me hate guys and I'm a guy.  The cool season arc conclusion, Primeval...wow!  And Restless which could be the single most important work in television...in visual media.  This is the best episode of the series when it comes to the philosophical depth the show goes in.  Listen to the commentary!  Go right ahead.  If you must own one Buffy season...this is the one!
