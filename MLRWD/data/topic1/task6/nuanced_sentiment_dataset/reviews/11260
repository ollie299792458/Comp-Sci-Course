A high-tech group of thieves infiltrates a vault in a London Antiques shop, thinking it hides a fortune, but ends up uncovering (and reviving) Dracula's remains.  After victimizing the entire group while on a trans-Atlantic flight, Dracula ends up in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. His new mission: pursue his last living descendant, Mary Van Helsing.  It's up to her father and his assistant to thwart Drac's plans...
This is a decent updating of the Dracula legend.  The direction, unfortunately, isn't always as energetic as one would want, and there are a few cheesy elements here and there.  But overall, I feel this film succeeds more than it fails, due in large part to its cast:  Gerard Butler (who will soon be in Michael Crichton's TIMELINE and TOMB RAIDER 2) is simply terrific as Dracula.  He brings a quiet sensuality to the role, as does Justine Waddell to her role of Mary(she looks like a young Linda Thorson, and I hope she goes on to bigger things).  Jonny Lee Miller plays the "White Knight" out to save Mary, and does so solidly.  They round out the most attractive triangle I've seen in awhile.  Rounding out the gorgeous and talented cast in smaller, but no less interesting, roles are Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick, Omar Epps, Jeri Ryan, and Christopher Plummer.  
Bottom line:  Decent flick, with a cast that is serious eye candy, and seriously talented....
