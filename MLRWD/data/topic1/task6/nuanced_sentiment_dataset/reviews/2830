Only because it wasn't one of my first choices.  There is such a thing as too many comedians spoil the movie.  For one thing, I felt that the comedy scenes where somewhat forced.  If anyone made their daughter use the side window as a toilet with only a towel to cover her lower back, they should have their head examined thoroughly and then sent to jail for endangering a child.  Realistically, no one would be able to survive the G-forces without oxygen, being pulled in that military airplane when Whoopi Goldberg's poorly dressed character and her daughter took off in it. I did manage a chuckle when Cuba Gooding's character found out the leader of a bus full of "I Love Lucy" immitators was a cross-dresser.  His deep voice almost made Gooding crash the bus.  I did not care for Kathy Bates's character, sending those people down the wrong path because they didn't buy anything from her road side stand. Rowan Atkinson's narcaleptic character wasn't all that funny either.  His falling asleep at the wrong time really got on my nerve as did his snoring.
I like the payback the team gave John Cleese's character, making him match the total on the board at the telethon and giving the prize money away.  It serves him right for making them run across country for a $2 billion jackpot stuffed in a locker.
