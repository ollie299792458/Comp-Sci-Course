John LeCarre debunks the James Bond glamour myth with it's bevy of beauties and clever gadgetry to give us the real portrait of espionage during the cold war years. Spies were nothing but underpaid civil servants and pawns in a chess match to see who wins the round--even if it is at the expense of the innocent. Much has already been written about this great movie adapted from an even greater novel, but little has been said about the machinations behind this movie.

Despite Burton's salary disputes, his jealous wife's presence on the set to keep her philandering hubby in tow (he had a brief affair some 20 years earlier with co-star Claire Bloom), wife Liz Taylor need not have worried. Burton was drunk so much of the time on the set, he had to rely on cue cards. Thanks to clever editing and careful shots by director Martin Ritt, Burton managed (under the circumstances) to pull of the almost incredible feat of being nominated for an Oscar in this gritty film, despite his condition. He plays a burnt out spy and looks it! Bloom (superb as always), plays Burton's lover who unwittingly becomes involved in this game and becomes an expendable pawn. Her performance is subtle and understated and highlights the film. Oskar Werner is also superior as the East German interrogator assigned to Burton who is pretending to defect to East Germany all for the sake of love and country that betrays him in the end.

The London scenes were shot in a dreary section of Dublin and adds to the bleak realism of the film.

This isn't always easy to watch, especially for those who love the clever 007 movies. Here is the reality. Get use to it.
