Absolutely one of the most definitive 70's gritty NYC films.  I've read how other reviewers have called it "dated".  But what does that mean?  It captured the time so well?  It captured the way people spoke in Manhattan on subway trains?  The lead character (Walter Matthau as Zach Garber) isn't PC enough?  (Yes, he makes fun of a group of visiting Japanese men as he gives a tour of the subway operations, but he gets it back in the end.)  It's not dated at all.  It's spot-on.

Taking of Pelham, One, Two, Three is the kind of film, if made today, would be called an independent.  It lacks every formulaic moment that goes into a studio picture.  It has no big action sequences (with the lone exception of a police car racing through the traffic of New York), it has no forced love interest, and there is no "big twist" ending.

This is currently being remade by Tony Scott and starring Denzel Washington and John Travolta.  What does this mean?  It means the look of the film will have a mustard-dirt filter that Scott puts into every movie and the editing will be fast cutting, like he does in every movie.  Denzel Washington will be smooth-talking, Yale-smart, unlike Matthau who had the weathered look of a beat cop with street smarts.  John Travolta will play the maniacal laugh and smile he does all the time when he's the villain, a la 'Broken Arrow' and 'Face-Off', unlike Robert Shaw who played it cool and collected.

In other words, please see the original.  It allowed the story and characters to be the entertainment instead of over-the-top fast cutting "stylized" nonsense that distracts rather than entertains.  This is a classic!
