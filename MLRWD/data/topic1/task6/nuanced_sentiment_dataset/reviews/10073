The Awful Truth
The movie starts out slow to the point "I'll pass on this one" but then starts moving along and then gets into the comedy of the situation. You'll hope they'll get back together. You might be attempted to stop watching after 15 minutes. Don't, it gets better. Not Cary Grants best but worth the price in this 3 CD set. About the reviews about the bad transfer. Forget. It is a 1937 film after all. True, it could have been restored to look better. For a typical Cary Grant film of the 30's, who would expect the studios to spend that kind of money when this is a very good print for the time. Now why would a CD not look as good as a VHS tape? Different source stock. The VHS tape could have been sourced from a 16mm print that is in better shape then the master, but when viewed from a CD to a 40" 1080p you would tend to see a grainy and not as sharp a picture. The master could have been damaged in it last use or aged even more since the VHS was made. A poor print, analog VHS, looks better than a CD digital of the same print.
