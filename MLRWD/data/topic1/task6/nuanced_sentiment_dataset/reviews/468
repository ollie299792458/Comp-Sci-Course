I decided to hold off on writing this review until I could fully digest the material.  From a performance standpoint, the band are nothing short of brilliant.  Having never seen Vai in concert, this was jaw dropping.  Every member of this band really pulls his weight.  Vai of course is stellar not just as a musician but as an entertainer as well.  To me the choice of material didnt really matter, because they played their hearts out on every single piece.
Alas this dvd is not without its flaws.  As a videographer I can appreciate the blood that the crew sweats to come up with a final product.  Having said that, I found some of the editorial decisions made in piecing this together questionable.  For starters the transitions from frame to frame are often "childish" - that is to say 'effects used for the sake of eye candy'. It gets a little tiresome after a while and one begins to wonder whether the editor was discovering these effects for the first time.  Secondly, I was not too happy with the 'shot selection' itself.  During 'Little Wing' was there any need to include a shot (for the vast majority of the song, I might add) of a fretboard closeup, that is totally OUT OF FOCUS?  Shots that are blurry are useless to all (esp the guitarists) who scrutinise this footage.  The same can be said of shots where Vai's back is to the camera for relatively long durations (esp during a solo!)
Finally, I would have preferred Dave Weiner's guitar actual output sound to have been higher.  He can barely be heard!  This is more of an issue with the people in charge of sound on the night though.
Vai fans should pick up this dvd not as a tribute to the footage itself, but as a salute to the 5 musicians who graced the Astoria and brought the roof down!  I only wish I could have seen this is person.
