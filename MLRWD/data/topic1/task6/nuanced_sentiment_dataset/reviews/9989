After 20 minutes of watching this movie I was completely sea sick.  How many movies have been made with a steady cam by a drunken camera operator already?  It has been done to death, and no matter how much you move the camera around the acting isn't going to be any better. The distracting camera work and week acting take away from what I feel cold have been a decent movie.  Although I like the actors in other things they have done, the entire time watching this movie, I felt as though they lacked something real.  They just seamed to be trying too hard.

The story line is good, about a kid with some anger problems working in a group with other teens with similar issues, who are completely different from one another, much like "Breakfast Club meets One Flew Over..."  It is real life, and what many kids go through. I just wish it would have been done in a way where the story was the focal point, not the clich&eacute; early 2000's style of camera work.  This movie will NOT stand the test of time.  It wasn't worth the time to watch it.
