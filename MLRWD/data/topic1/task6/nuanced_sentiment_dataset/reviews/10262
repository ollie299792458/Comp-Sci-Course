This movie to say the absolute least is a bit strange. If you are not into people turning into bugs or junkies freaking out over trivial events, this movie is not for you. However, if you find conspiracy theory intriguing and dark comedies inviting, by all means buy this DVD.

The best part about this movie was the animation. I've never seen the film "Waking Life" however the director, Richard Linklater used the same animation in both films. To devote so much time to a film is awe inspiring. To not only direct a regular film with live actors and backgrounds but then to go back over it with animation. It's amazing.

The acting was good. Robert Downey Jr. is phenomenal,  and Woody Harelson fits the Junkie California dude profile to a tee ( we can look at this two ways, both are wonderful actors who have developed their craft very well, however it is no secret Woody and Robert have done extensive research in the underground drug culture). But Rory Cochrane steals the show as the scratching, fiending, suicidal Freck that at one point is told every sin he has committed by a green monster with roughly a thousand eyes. Keanu Reeves is his adorable beautiful self, meaning the only reason he still gets work is that he is attractive. Not even animation can make Reeves resemble an actor. He however is just supplemental in comparison to the rest of the cast. He does not make or break this picture.

While I believe that the direction and acting are superb, the film lacks substance. It lacks closure. Why won't Wynona Ryder put out? Does Reeves ever escape the imprisonment of Substance D (Metaphorically or physically)? What was the end result of the other characters? While this film has twists, turns, ups, and downs, and I consider it to be a good representation of not only addict culture but the seedy operations of our government as well, that does not excuse the fact that it leaves many unanswered questions.
