Hostage starts off promisingly and progresses so pretty effectively for quite a period of time and holds you spell bound till then. But eventually it degenerates into a psycho killer teenage scream flick. This is awful. Have the film makers so completely run dry of ideas that they are reduced to  having to rely on the mad-psycho-chasing-nubile-female-child device in the middle of hostage crisis action movie? Anyway, eventually the psycho gets taken care of so the scene of the movie can shift to wrap up the other pointless thread of the movie and then it ends with bruce willis howling in silence while hugging his wife, with his mouth so wide open I had to wonder if he was going to try and swallow his wife's head.

Its as if a group of people tried to rig up some sort of formula and decided that a Die Hard type movie with bruce willis would be good but it had to move on up from that formula, so add some personal stake for the negotiator, spice it up with a two layer hostage taking, throw in a Scream type teen screamfest and voila.

except, its garbage. You want to see a quality film, find something else. But if mindless psycho screamfests hold you riveted in your seat, well, this one even has a  lame hostage plot thrown in, kinda like greasy fries with your crappy cheeseburger. Bon Apetit.

For the rest of us, I wish the movie could have carried through with its good first half to the end.
