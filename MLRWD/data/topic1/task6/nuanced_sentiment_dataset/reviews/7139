I saw this movie in the most unromantic place possible, the coach cabin of a long transatlantic flight. Yes, I was a captive audience with little else to watch or do, but usually I turn on the movie for 15 minutes and then go back to reading my book. I'm usually not a fan of the tearjerker genre either, but this movie however managed to hold my attention.

This is a very sweet story about love and dedication. Duke, played by James Garner visits everyday with an Alzheimers patient in a nursing home, played superbly by Gena Rolands. He reads her stories in the hopes that it might help her remember something about her own life. The story he tells her is about a young man, Noah, and young woman, Allie, played by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. They are from different backgrounds and they fall in love at the eve of World War II.

The story told is not particularly unique, parents disapproving, young lovers seperated, etc. But the acting, sets and costuming are very good in this movie, making it very easy to get caught up in the story of Noah and Allie.

This movie has some big tearjerker moments. It was hard to watch on the plane and muffle my sniffles and dab at my tears without being embarrased, since my husband was sitting next to me laughing his head off at Anchorman. So, while I recommend watching it in a different location, I do recommend this movie. I enjoyed it and if you like romantic movies, you probably will too.
