Some real gems mixed in with quite a bit of dull footage.  Good for nostalgia... especially the "Duck and Cover" scenes... my 6th grade teacher always promised she was going to show us that film, but it was hard to get from the San Diego City Schools A/V Department by  1971 (it was already considered a hoot by then).  The best scenes are those from the Army field tests, with the soldiers dutifully being exposed to the blast, and marching in towards the fireball - really freaky stuff.  It all reminds me of the monthly Air Raid Siren tests... it was really eeiry - in the 60's, the tests would go off every 1st Tuesday of the month at 12:00 noon.  I'd stand on the upper terrace of our hilltop-located school, and listen to all the Air Raid Sirens winding up and down all over San Diego (there was one outside every school and every fire station - really LOUD, 35' tall, yellow SOBs they were)... whenever they had a test, you couldn't help but think; now would be the PERFECT time for the Russians to ATTACK!  But, it was all BS anyway - if they did attack, San Diego County and all the Aircraft Carriers and Military Bases would have been VAPORIZED!  Then, one day, the city came to their senses and stopped testing; and a few years after that, the sirens all just disappeared (sold as junk, I guess).
