If you read no further than this sentence, take this sentiment with you: High Tension is a great film. The film has taken - and continues to take - a beating from critics and casual movie goers alike who just don't seem to appreciate and/or understand what director Alexandre Aja is trying to communicate. Perhaps the 'popcorn crowd' was expecting Will Smith to save the day with a witty zinger  or two whilst firing a few rounds from his sideways held 9mm? But, I digress. The premise of High tension is simple, intense, and quite unsettling. Perhaps it is this 'blunt force trauma' to the psyche that has so alienated certain viewers who have grown numb and complacent from having watched far too many dumbed-down teen comedies and even dumber teen horror fare (that means you Boogeyman and Cursed). Without spoiling the ending of the film, High Tension presents a scenario in which compulsion and obsession are taken to grisly extremes. Every action does indeed have a purpose, and the symbolism will not be lost on the observant and open-minded viewer. I encourage anyone who enjoys and appreciates well crafted horror cinema to treat themselves and see High Tension. You'll be glad that you did.
