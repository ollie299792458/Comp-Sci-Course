Ok since when does Peter Pan grow up forget who he is and then have a wife, 2 kids, and a job?!! What was Robin Williams thinking when he signed up for this part? Did he acually think he would pull off being Peter Pan!! I was very dissapointed when saw this movie! First of all Robin Williams. He didn't bring out the childlike influence with Peter Pan. He looked lost through out the intire movie!! And when he said his lines he sounded like he was going to fall asleep!! Then there are the Lost Boys. Why wasen't there teens playing them instead of 8 year old kids that couldn't act if there life depended on it!! They amount of swearing that these kids really atonished me!! And for some stupid reason they were on skateboards and trashed talked through out the intire movie!! Dustin Hoffman. He is the worst Hook I have ever seen anybody play in my whole 16 years of my life!! First of all his acting was stale and sour! And at times he even overacted making me want to smack him because he was soo bad!! And just Robin Williams he looked like he was lost!!! And Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell!!! I can't describe how bad she was at playing this part!!! And one more thing was the amount of violence and swearing in this movie!! So if you have a little kid please don't make them watch this!!
