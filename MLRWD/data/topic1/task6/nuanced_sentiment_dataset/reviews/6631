I love the original Off-Broadway stage production.  I saw it in 1972 when I was 16.  The film could have been so much better.  As it is, it's OK.  Granted, this is a musical that weaves it magic on the stage where imagination and intimacy are part of the show.  That being said, this film is a mixed bag.  I like the girl a lot.  The boy...not so much.  Joel Grey is fine but the actor playing the boy's father seems all wrong for the part.  Barnard Hughes and Teller are perfectly cast.  The choice for El Gallo is peculiar.  Sounding a lot like Peter O'Toole, his perfomance is hit and miss.  The film LOOKS great with an intelligent use of magic hour light.  The orchestrations by that genius, Jonathan Tunick  are, quite simply, brilliant!  The first time I saw the film, the opening title sequence began and within moments I said to myself "That sounds like Jonathan Tunick's orchestrations."  About 30 seconds later, the credit appeared on the screen, "Orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick".  Amazing!  Taking a beautiful score originally performed by piano and harp, it fully blossoms with his lush romantic musical sensibilities.  Thank you so much, Mr. Tunick.
