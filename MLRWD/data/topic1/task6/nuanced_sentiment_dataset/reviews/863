One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is one of the finest films I have ever  seen.  And I've seen a few.  What a shame, then, that this masterpiece is  presented so poorly on the much trumpeted 'superior' format.  More on that  later.  There isn't much to say about this film that you haven't heard  already.  Director Milos Forman paints a savage picture of 1970s America,  using the mental hospital setting as an allegory for a country that didn't  know its arse from its elbow.  There is much mirth to be enjoyed as Jack  Nicholson's McMurphy navigates his way around the two-faced, manipulative  institution, playing those in charge at their own game.  Forman skillfully  turns the tone on its head as McMurphy loses an unwinnable battle; his  pointless and tragic end is heartbreaking.  What strikes me most Cuckoo's  Nest is how such a powerful film could be so damn entertaining - and funny.  It's infuriating that Warner Bros put zero effort into giving this film  the DVD presentation it deserves.  The picture is no better than a good VHS  tape and the sound has to be turned right up to be listenable.  Unbelievably for an Oscar champion, there are no extra features of note.  This is a pathetic disc and Warner Bros should seriously consider  re-releasing it in an edition worthy of its greatness.  Five stars for the  film, one star for the disc.
