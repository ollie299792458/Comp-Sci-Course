I don't feel that I need to say much about the movie -- many others have given excellent reviews.  Suffice it to say that I love this movie and have watched it time and time again.

Where I'm disappointed is with the Blu-Ray release.  This picture is nice and crisp, but the high-definition transfer seems substandard, with colors washed out in places.  This might be due to the age of the materials used in the transfer, but that's just speculation.

A bigger disappointment was the lack of bonus features.  There are a few bonus items on the disc (most totally uninteresting), while on the DVD special edition there are quite a few more special features.  Blu-Ray discs are supposed to have so much more capacity for data storage that it surprised me that ALL of the bonus features from the DVD were not included.  This mean I have to keep my DVD copy if I want to have access to all the special features.  This is very feeble thinking on the part of the 20th Century Fox, as it makes me less likely to grab a Blu-Ray version of something in the future.
