I confess that I did not purchase this video; however, I did watch this movie today on TV.  It is a wonderful Western, full of charm, a little corniness, some great humorous scenes, as well as a realistic-looking tale of pioneers crossing the wide-open country through the wild, Indian-settled plains, to a glorious new life in the American Northwest.  It is interesting to see John Wayne already taking the moral high ground in several scenes throughout this early movie from 1930, much as he did the rest of his movie career.  The long straight-on shot of pretty Marguerite Churchill leaning out the back of her conestoga wagon with a glimpse of cleavage is quite risque for 1930, though maybe not surprising just coming out of the "Roaring Twenties."  The scenery is awesome, even in black & white, and the sub-plots are set-up quickly and perfectly early in the film.  The scene of lowering people, cattle, and conestoga wagons down the cliff by ropes is a little unbelieveable, but who knows!  Some of the scenes like the wagon swept away in the river with paniced women and children being rescued, and the wagon that fell down the cliff look like they were possibly not staged, but the footage was well incorporated into the movie.  (It would be interesting to know whether or not these scenes were staged.)  This is a hidden gem, not only for John Wayne fans, but for all fans of Westerns!
