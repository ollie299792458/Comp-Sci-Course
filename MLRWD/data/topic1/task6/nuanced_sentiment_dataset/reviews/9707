This 1980 slasher flick is now hailed as a prime influence in the slasher genre today. Today, This movie seems a little dated and quite tame as opposed to when this was first released. 2 teens are mysteriously murdered at Camp Crystal Lake in 1958. 22 years later, Camp counselors return to Crystal Lake only to find themselves being savagely murdered one by one by a psychotic serial killer. This was a huge hit in its day in spite of its poor reviews from the critics. The acting and the plot as usual is not good, Which is all too typical of a slasher movie. Like many, I was shocked when it was revealed at the end of the movie that the killer in this movie was actually a woman [Jason's mother]! The murders are quite clever at times and there is a fair share of genuine terror to be found in this movie. Watch for the classic scene in the end where Jason Voorhees comes back to life and pulls the sole survivor of the movie down in the water with him! If you're interested in old-school slasher movies, Then you'd do no wrong by picking this up. In the years following the release of this movie, This movie has gained a cult following and is now considered an important movie by horror buffs. Followed by nine sequels, a tv show, and a spin-off [Freddy Vs. Jason].
