There are only two Superman movies before he Returned, and those were I and II - Anything else is a joke. Let me review the movie and the edition:

I needed Superman II since I purchased the original some time ago, but looking at it now I can really notice the change of pace, tone and respect to the material from the different directors. Richard Donner's Superman I is the grandaddy of all comic book movie adaptations, the standard to follow, and one of my all-time favorites. Sadly Superman II has a more "Campy", dare I say "Corny", feel to it despite many of the scenes being planned and shot by Donner at the same time as the first movie. The promise of a Super-men (and woman) fight is central, but the execution falls short with action sequences clearly meant to be comical and kid-oriented. Nevertheless, it is part of the collection.

The Special Features on the second disc, however, are not worth much. Half of it is dedicated to a great series of original Superman cartoons, which I admit were before my time but should have nostalgic value to some. Then the other half is a "Making of" special as old as the movie (and TV quality at best, with grainy images to boot") and not up to modern documentary standards - missing current and new points of view from cast and crew that are not forced for promotional benefit at the time of the movie release. Then there is a 50th anniversary special hosted by Dana Carvey with very lame humor and mock-up interviews which I felt demeaning and a total waste of time. I was hoping for an in-depth explanation of Superman's history in print and film, and/or a "making of" that went into further detail about the change in direction the series took for Superman II and after. Sadly, there is four-times as much information and high-quality exposition on this movie in the special features of my Superman I one-disc release (which I highly recommend to anyone).
