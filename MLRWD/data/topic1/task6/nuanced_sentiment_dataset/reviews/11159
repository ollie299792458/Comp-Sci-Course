I appreciate Iron Maiden releasing this concert video because when I went to the first show of this tour in Dallas, I witnessed the live debut of "El Dorado" and an average at best song list that contained no classics until the last four songs (the same on this set).  "The Final Frontier" is Maiden's best album in a long time, and their live selections from it are good, but one of the top two songs "Isle of Avalon" is strangely missing.  The video and sound quality are excellent just like the "Flight" Blu-ray.  There are a lot of split/multi-screen shots which offer a unique perspective.  The only drawbacks:  "Dance of Death" - never got into it, it's a mediocre regurgitation of "Number of the Beast"; I loathe Janick Gers and his buffoonery, stage antics, posturing, and butchering of Adrian Smith's solos.  I give credit for the band as a whole to put out another good concert video with an enthusiastic audience.  Additionally, they again add some nice extras including an interesting documentary to complete a solid package.  Maiden has always done a good job in catering to its fans...albeit a few too many "best hits" albums.  I have been watching their videos for 25 years and highly recommend this one for Iron Maiden fans.
