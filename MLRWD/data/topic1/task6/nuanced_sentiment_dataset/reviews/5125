Ok, I thought that Thunderball would be better then Goldfinger and in some places of the movie it is.  The action is really hiped up, and many shots were very well done, but all in all, this movie kinnda falls short.  The plot is great, but it was great 40 yrs ago when Nukes were still a new and horrible thing.  Not saying that nukes arent scary, but they were alot more in that time period.  Then the plot moves kinnda slow.  Lots of one liners by connery, and in some places it doesent feel like a bond movie but just mindless oneliners and babble.  The villin is ok, but just not the best. The bond girls were fine lookin, but there parts were not scripted well.  Thunderball is good, dont get me wrong, but Dr.No is really outdated, and that movie is still considered one of the best bonds ever.  Thunderball just doesent have the timeless feeling to it like Dr.No,FRWL,Goldfinger,TSWLM,FYEO,TLD,& GE have. It just feels like they were picking up with what Goldfinger had left over. But its better than many others in the series.
