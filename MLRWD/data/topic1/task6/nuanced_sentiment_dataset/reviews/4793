Last night I had the, well, I won't say pleasure so let's just say occurrence, of watching "The New Guy" on DVD.
Yeesh.
As most people who know me, or at least read what I write about movies on occasion, know that I'm pretty forgiving about movies. I don't expect Shakespeare when it's not meant to be Shakespeare. It's a good way to be, as there are lots of movies out there that aren't great by any means but have their charm.
The New Guy ain't one of them.
It's about this kid who enters his senior year hoping to be more than just a loser, gets horribly embarassed, goes to prison for a day or so for no real reason, gets the idea from an inmate he befriends that if he gets expelled and sent to a new school, he can start acting all tough and crazy and be popular, does so, and becomes so before the inevitable unveiling of who he used to be by the bullies at the old school. And of course all is forgiven because even though he supposedly has a reputation as a crazy killer of a guy at the new school, he still has a heart of gold.
Throughout the movie we also see him in and out of prison, just visiting it appears, but still allowed in among all the kind-hearted inmates. And we see Jerry O'Connell and his brother who are way too old to still play high school guys. And we see football games that play out in mere minutes. And we see Eliza Dushku trying out bathing suits. That was the good part. The only good part in the whole movie.
No wait, there was a second, Zooey Deschenal was in the movie.
Do yourself a favor - don't see this movie. Don't be stupid like me. If given the choice between this movie and unnecessary dental work, choose the movie, but at least think hard about it before doing so.
