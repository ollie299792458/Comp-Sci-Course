I love dogs, Santa Claus, and Christmas... so I thought a movie with all three would be great. Alas, "Santa Buddies" is no Christmas classic. It is more like a piece of Christmas crud that might (hopefully, accidentally) get placed in your stocking.
The magic icicle that stores Christmas Cheer throughout the year is melting fast. It seems that society as a whole has grown too cynical for Christmas. As a result, Santa Claus ( an especially pained and uncomfortable George Wendt) faces a major crisis/power failure at the North Pole. Also, Puppy Claus chooses to ignore his responsibility of  delivering gifts to dogs all over the world. He runs away and meets up with the "Dog Buddies" gang; who all must evade the clutches of dog catcher Christopher Lloyd.
  "Santa Buddies" piles on every Christmas cliche in the book. Will Lloyd's cold and crusty dog catcher develop a heart of gold and give a free dog to a disabled boy? Will enough Christmas cheer be found in the hearts of cynical, jaded humans to save Christmas? Well, yes, but the production values on this "Direct to DVD" Christmas clunker are terribly shoddy.  Wendt and Lloyd, who have both had much better days doing "Cheers," "Alice In Wonderland," "Bye Bye Birdie"  and "Taxi" and "Back To The Future" films, respectively,  don't seem too happy to be in this movie, for painfully obvious reasons. The best that can be said about "Santa Buddies" is that it is occasionally cute. But it is the type of Christmas movie that parents might put in the DVD player to act as a "video babysitter" for their children while they are otherwise too busy or too stressed out during the holiday season. I can't imagine any family taking time out of their busy holiday schedules to sit down and watch this together.  After watching "Santa Buddies" (and remember, I love dogs, Santa Claus, and Christmas) I regret purchasing it and do not intend to watch it ever again.
