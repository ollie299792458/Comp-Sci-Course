Poor Sean Bean: a great actor, he has been cast as a worried father in two recent films -- 'The Dark' and 'Silent Hill' -- that don't give him much to do except try to deal with an obsessive mother and a tragic child. At least 'The Dark' has great scenery!  The plot is pretty standard (and very much like the aforementioned 'Silent Hill'): an American mother brings her daughter to Wales to visit her father, an artist, who lives in suitably remote and rather creepy cottage.  Maria Bello's Adele is not the most sympathetic mother; in flashbacks, she's not the best caretaker for her child, and we see that the Welsh trip is an attempt for a "second chance" with her daughter.  Of course, in the dark upper story of the cottage, there's a secret, and, like many films of this kind ('The Ring' is another good example), the mother's devotion to saving her child takes her into what appears to be madness.  At times, the film is literally so 'dark', it's hard to tell what's happening; I like creepy, but when you have to rewind a scene to try to see it clearly, that destroys the suspense. There is, of course, the requisite twist at the end (who's really alive, good, come back from the dead, etc), and at least Sean Bean has a little more to do here than in 'Silent Hill'!  I also liked the killer sheep, which is something you just don't see in most horror films...
