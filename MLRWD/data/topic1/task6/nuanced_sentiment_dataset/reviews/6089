To this day, I will never understand why this movie isn't more well known. As far as I'm concerned, this is THE best haunted house movie ever made. I saw it on cable waaaaay back in the early 80's as a young teenager, and instantly it became one of my favorite films. Here I am, almost 30 years later, writing this review, and the memory of that first viewing is as clear as if it were yesterday, and I admit, the goose bumps are starting already. A truly creepy, quite scary, and intensly atmospheric film that sucks you right in and builds steadily throughout. This is a perfect example of what a great script, director, and cast can do. There is no need for gallons of blood or shock value. Good old fashioned suspense, and what you DON'T see. You will not be disappointed with this movie. I agree with one reviewer in that the shot of the wheelchair at the top of the stairs still gets me. And the ball bouncing down the stairs. I still hear it when I close my eyes. God, they don't make em like this anymore!!!
