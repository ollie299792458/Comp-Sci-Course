This is probably the most fun, enjoyable Showa Godzilla movie. The plot involves Ancient Japanese folklore, Intergalactic Espionage, Exciting Kaiju battles and plenty of charisma and skill from most of the actors performing. The special effects are some of the best in the Showa series, especially compared to the quiality of effects in the last two entries. Acting is all around adequate, though no one in particular's performance stands out. The story progresses at a fast pace, and I found it never to be boring.

Younger children on the other hand will probably not enjoy this film becasue of the amount of non kaiju-realted action and plot development. Also, as some reviewers have somewhat comically complained about, their younger kids and sometimes siblings where upset by a graphic battle between Meachgodzilla and Angurius, which involved some pretty nasty mouth wounds. Just a heads up for people planning on watching this movie with small kids.

A great movie all around, and one of the better Showa entries. Great for repeated viewings.
