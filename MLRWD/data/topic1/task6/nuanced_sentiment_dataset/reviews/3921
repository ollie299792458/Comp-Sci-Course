It's very difficult for me to understand four and five star, and even three star, reviews of Fingerprints. The talent of a relatively good lead actress are wasted in a movie which meanders back and forth between a ghost story and a slasher plot. The lame, hackneyed, predictable "climax" is made even worse by amazingly amateurish performances on the part of other actors, and by abysmal directing. If not for a few (accidental, I'm convinced) interesting story ideas and, again, some decent acting on the part of some, this would have become a one star movie once and for all after the viewer is finally subjected to what might be the single worst post-climax gotchya shocker endings I've ever seen - one of those stupid "it ain't really over folks, fooled ya didn't we" final moments that is the sure sign of a truly untalented screenwriter (two, in this case - brothers, apparently).

Don't even waste your money on a $1 rental. You're better off re-watching Carpenter's The Fog if you're in the mood for a slasheresque ghost story.
