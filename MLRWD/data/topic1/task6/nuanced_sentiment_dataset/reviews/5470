Please dont listen to Nick Harleys review being frim Alabama that obviousley influences this ridiculous decision of 5 stars. I guess Alabama dont get much of anything so this movie must be a big part in states history, i dont know.

Anyway, this  movie is very low budget which I knew. Its an Ok movie with some Zombies, with quite horrible make up, not much GORE if really none, until the end there are 3 or 4 scenes that are quit excellent FX wise dont know why there wasnt more. The acting is pretty bad the humor is dry except for 2 or 3 funny parts. In no way in hell is this movie anywhere of the quality Shaun of the Dead is. NOt even in the same league. It says on the cover funnier than shaun of the Dead , who are they kidding.

Im stuck between liking it and hating it. Its one of these movies you hate or like no inbetween thank GOD I only rented it from Blockbuster, for the price of $22  you would be getting ripped off. Please rent b4 you buy. This movie doesnt succeed anywhere , they just barely make it an ok movie with the comedy, the gore the acting everything is mediocre to poor nothing much to brag about.

Please take my opinion and rent first then make your decision. Im still deciding if im going to keep it only for the fact i have some what 40 or so Zombie movbies and this will just be part of the collection, I have just about any one I can buy except for a couple I know about that I heard are quit bad and will let them sit on the shelf.PLus if I keep it from Blockbuster it will only cost about $16 so I  might just keep it cause its an ok/decent Zombie movie proably one that i will never watch again maybe once every year.
