A Bug's Life. What can you say but...wow! Great script, simple plot (Though acusidly "overused" but who cares) and all-star cast. It's a very creative cross of the "The Grasshopper &amp; The Ant" fable and "The Seven Samuari". A great family film even when not watched by the whole family.
The picture detail on this DVD is absolutely flawless. Since this is the world's first digital to digital transfer. Congratulations to PIXAR for another great innovation! Too bad the only put a anamorphic transfer on the Collector's Edition DVD for those of you with widescreen TVs. The sound on this is great too. I can't really say much since my sound system is a puny 2.0 channel plain sterieo. But I'm sure it would be good. The extras on this disc are unbelievably low. Nothing that you couldn't see at the theater. They didn't even include a trailer. That's why I would prefer the Collector's Edition DVD to this anyday. 
But other than that, the movie itself is something to cherish altogether. I can't give this DVD a 5 star rating because of the lack of extras and lack of anamorphic transfer. But if you don't have a widescreen tv and don't care about the extras, this ones for you. For those others like me, check into the Collector's Editon DVD.
I'm going to pay my respects for Madenline Kahn since this was her last filmography (or second to last) before her untimely death. I will not elaborate since I have only seen her in two roles. She was just right for the role of Gypsy. Perfect voice. That's all I'll say.
Anyway, great picture &amp; sound, awesome movie, a family feature must-have.
