I found this film watchable, but it just seemed to be about a group of Chinese twenty-somethings in unremarkable daily situations working backstage (and onstage) at the 'Five Continents' theme park. One thing I did pick up on was the insidious slogan "see 'the World' in Beijing" which seemed to imply that there's no reason to ever leave and explore the life 'outside' China.

Why think about going to the trouble of travelling to London, Paris, New York when the best each country has to offer has all been created for you right there (to sub-scale). And people in other countries think Disneyland is propaganda, at least they have a Fantasyland there instead of recreating the island of Manhattan WITH the World Trade Center (not to mention the 1/3 scale Eiffel Tower dominating the city skyline)!

I can't entirely recommend the movie though the photography and some of the 'spectacle' dance moments are impressive. They definitely milked the mini-'Leaning Tower of Pisa' gag one time too many, but minimalists might enjoy this slice-of-life in a world where security guards can hook up with dancers, for better or worse.

It also seemed ironic to me that the couple that was sparring for the entire film decides to get married, sort of an accident waiting to happen of you ask me. But maybe that was part of incongruity the director set up with the false expectations of a man-made world done to scale with the Beijing tourists exclaiming "Wow, that's so big" when what they're seeing is really just a partial scale recreation of London Bridge, etc.

Of course, the main reason the Chinese government would want to re-create all the wonders of the world at home is to discourage applications for exit visa's (and the possible defections that could follow). The film does allude to the black market demand for fake visa's and ID but only minimally.

A bit slowly paced overall considering it's 2 hour plus length, but worth a look for those curious about life inside China.
