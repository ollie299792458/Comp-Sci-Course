I HAD TO REVISE MY REVIEW AFTER VIEWING VCI'S 2005 RELEASE OF THIS GREAT FILM WHOSE ORIGINAL TITLE IN ENGLAND WAS CALLED, CITY OF THE DEAD. WHEN THIS FILM WAS DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE EARLY 1960'S UNDER THE TITLE OF HORROR HOTEL, IT HAD BEEN RUDELY EDITED AND KEY SCENES WERE DRASTICALLY SHORTENED, DIAOLOG CUT AND SEVERAL CAMERA SHOTS DONE AWAY WITH.

THANK GOD FOR THIS DVD COMPANY CALLED VCI ENTERTAINMENT WHO, IN COOPERATION WITH THE BRITISH FILM INSTITUTE, OBTAINED THE ORIGINAL 35MM PRINT OF CITY OF THE DEAD AND DIGITALLY REMASTERED IT TO DVD FULLY INTACT WITH SEVERAL RESTORED SCENES OF FOOTAGE NEVER BEFORE SEEN IN THE UNITED STATES.

IF YOU ARE A TRUE FAN OF THIS FILM LIKE MYSELF, YOU WILL RELISH THIS OFFERING. THE FIRST SCENE WHERE THE WITCH, ELIZABETH SELWYN, MAKES HER PACT WITH THE DEVIL WHILE BEING BURNED AT THE STAKE, HAS BEEN FULLY RESTORED AND BOY, LET ME TELL YOU, WE HAVE BEEN MISSING OUT ALL THESE YEARS, NEVER REALIZING THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE DIALOG AND CAMERA ANGLES IN THAT FIRST SCENE THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. YOU HAVE TO SEE AND HEAR THIS UNREPENTANT WITCH BEG LUCIFER IN A BARGAIN FOR HER SOUL WHILE SHE PLACES THE TOWN AND PEOPLE OF WHITEWOOD UNDER A SATANIC CURSE. IT IS A GEM OF A SCENE. NOW INTACT!

THERE IS ALSO MORE IMPORTANT DIOLOG FROM VALENTINE DYALL IN THE FIRST SCENE AS HE TOO MAKES A PACT WITH LUCIFER WHILE WATCHING SELWYN DIE AT THE STAKE. BY THE WAY, THE EXTRA CAMERA ANGLES THAT HAVE BEEN RESTORED IN THIS FIRST SCENE CLEALRY SHOW, IN MY VIEW, SELWYN APPEARING AS IF SHE IS ACTUALLY SEEING THE DEVIL AFTER SHE PROMISES HER SOUL TO HIM FOR ETERNAL LIFE.

THE SECOND SCENE WHERE DENIS LOTIS ENGAGES CHRISTOPHER LEE IN AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THE REALITY OF WITCHCRAFT HAS BEEN FULLY RESTORED AND IS MUCH LONGER THAN PREVIOSULY SEEN HERE IN THE STATES. LOTIS' CHARACTER, PROFESSOR BARLOW, DERIDES LEE'S BELIEF IN WITCHES AND THE DEVIL AND MOCKS HIM. THEY GET INTO A HEATED DEBATE WITH PREVIOSULY DELETED DIOLOG AND CAMERA ANGLES NEVER SHOWN BEFORE. THIS HELPS THE VIEWER MORE FULLY UNDERSTAND LEE'S MOTIVATION FOR REVENGE AGAINST LOTIS, AT THE COST OF HIS SISTER'S LIFE.

ALSO, THE LAST SCENE IN THE CEMETARY, SEVERAL EXTRA CAMERA SHOTS AND ANGLES HAVE BEEN RESTORED, THAT SHOW EVEN MORE OF THE WARLOCKS AND WITCHES BURNING IN FLAMES AS THE SHADOW OF THE CROSS IS CAST UPON THEIR ROBED BODIES IN THE FOG SHROUDED GRAVEYARD. THE PRINT OF THIS FILM IS SO CLEAR IN COMPARSION TO THE GRAINY IMAGES OF THE FORMER VERSION PREVIOUSLY SHOWN ON LATE NIGHT TELEVISION IN THE 1960'S AND 70'S, THAT I WAS AMAZED. AND THE AUDIO AND THE HAUNTING MUSIC WERE CRYSTAL CLEAR.
YOU WILL NOTICE SEVERAL ADDED CAMERA ANGLES AND A BIT OF DIAOLOG RESTORED HERE AND THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FILM AS WELL.

ALSO TO BE ENJOYED ARE SEVERAL INTERVIEWS WITH SOME OF THE ACTORS AND THE DIRECTOR OF THIS MOVIE, AS WELL AS MANY STILL SHOTS OF THE PRODUCTION. SINCE I HAVE KNOWN THIS FILM AS HORROR HOTEL FOR THE PAST 45 YEARS OR SO, IT'S HARD FOR ME TO FORGET THAT TITLE BUT I WILL, FROM NOW ON, REFER TO THIS FILM AS, THE CITY OF THE DEAD, AS IT WAS MEANT TO BE CALLED BY IT'S CREATORS. IT DESERVES THAT.

WORD OF WARNING HERE: IF YOU BUY THIS FILM THROUGH AMAZON.COM, BE CAREFUL TO ORDER THE RESTORED VERSION BY VCI ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH IS 78 MINUTES LONG. DO NOT ORDER THIS FILM UNDER THE TITLE OF HORROR HOTEL BECAUSE IF YOU DO, YOU WILL RECEIVE THE OLD PUBLIC DOMAIN VERSION OF THE FILM THAT WAS SO POORLY EDITED BY AMERICAN FILM DISTRIBUTORS ALL THOSE YEARS AGO. MAKE SURE YOU ORDER, THE CITY OF THE DEAD, BY VCI, WHO, I BELIEVE. HAS THEIR OWN WEBSITE, VCI ENTERTAINMENT.COM.

MAKE SURE THE VERSION YOU BUY HAS THE RESTORED TWO MINUTES OR SO OF FOOTAGE AND THAT IT HAS THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE GREAT CHRISTOPHER LEE, ACTRESS VENETIA STEVENSON, DIRECTOR JOHN MOXEY, PHOTO GALLERY, CAST BIOS AND THEATRICAL TRAILER. THE VCI ENTERTAINMENT VERSION I AM REFERRING TO WAS DISTIBUTED IN 2005. AN EARLIER VERSION OF THE FILM MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN RELEASED THROUGH VCI IN 2001, BUT I AM NOT SURE ON THAT. BELIEVE ME, YOU WANT THE VERSION THAT IS 78 MINUTES LONG, NOT 76 MINUTES.

WHAT A GREAT HORROR FILM THIS IS, WHAT WITH THE GREAT CHRISTOPHER LEE AND PATRICIA JESSEL AND DENNIS LOTIS LEADING THE CAST IN THIS CLASSIC CREEPY TALE OF LUCIFER'S CURSE UPON THE CITIZENS OF A SMALL NEW ENGLAND TOWN IN THE LATE 1600'S AND MID 20TH CENTURY.

THE OPENING SCENE IS CLASSIC WITCH BURNING AT IT'S BEST. NOT TO BE OVERLOOKED IN THIS GREAT MOVIE IS THE ENGLISH ACTOR VALENTINE DYALL WHO PLAYS A WARLOCK WHO RISES FROM THE GRAVE TO HELP THE SINISTER PATRICIA JESSEL WHO, AS ELIZABETH SELWYN THE WITCH, IS REINCARNATED IN THE 20TH CENTURY AS AN EVEN MORE SINISTER WITCH BY THE NAME OF MRS. NEWLIS, A VERY STYLISH AND CLASSY DISCIPLE OF THE DEVIL WHO IS PURE EVIL.

DENNIS LOTIS, THE ENGLISH ACTOR AND SINGER, PLAYS A NIFFY PART AS A COLLEGE PROFESSOR WHOSE SISTER IS THE VICTIM OF A HUMAN SACRIFICE TO SATAN IN THE FABLED BUT DAMNED NEW ENGLAND VILLAGE OF WHITEWOOD, MASS. LOTIS HAD TO SOUND AMERICAN IN HIS ROLE AND REMINDED ME OF CARY GRANT'S VOCAL STYLE WITH A CLIPPED ACCENT THAT WAS MORE BRITISH THAN AMERICAN BUT NONETHELESS, AN OUTSTANDING ROLE FOR DENNIS LOTIS.

CHRISTOPHER LEE, THE STAR OF SO MANY HAMMER HORROR FILMS, PLAYS AN EERIE COLLEGE PROFESSOR WHO IS REALLY A REINCARNATED WARLOCK, BENT ON HUMAN SACRIFICE. THE BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHY WAS GREAT, AS WAS THE DIRECTION AND DIALOG. THE ATMOSPHERE WAS UNFORGETTABLE WITH A FOG SHROUDED VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED, CREEPY OLD CEMETARY, DARK, LONELY ROADS. THE MUSIC WAS PERFECT FOR THIS FILM FROM THE VERY BEGINNING TO THE CLASSIC ENDING.

THE TOWN OF WHITEWOOD, MASS. REMINDS ME OF THE STILL INTACT 17TH CENTURY VILLAGE KNOWN AS RICHMONDTOWN IN STATEN ISLAND, NEW YORK, WHICH IS A LANDMARK VILLAGE, PRESERVED FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND NESSTLED BESIDE THE 17TH CENTURY ST. ANDREW'S CHURCH AND GRAVEYARD WITH HEADSTONES GOING BACK TO THE LATE 1600'S.

THIS IS TRULY ONE OF THE BEST ATMOSPHERIC GOTHIC HORROR MOVIES OF ALL TIME. DIRECTOR JOHN MOXLEY DID AN EXCELLENT JOB! THE COMPANY WHO MADE THIS GEM WAS CALLED VULCAN FILMS, LATER TO BECOME AMICUS FILMS, WHO BROUGHT US THE ORIGINAL AND STILL THE BEST, THE GREAT BRITISH HORROR FILMS LIKE THE ORIGINAL (STILL THE BEST)TALES FROM THE CRYPT, THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD, DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS, THE VAULT OF HORROR, ASYLUM, FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE, ETC.

CITY OF THE DEAD HAD ONE OF THE BEST ENDINGS EVER SEEN IN ANY HORROR FILM. WITCHES AND WARLOCKS WHO BURST INTO FLAMES AS THE SHADOW OF THE CROSS IS CAST UPON THEM AT THE WITCHING HOUR IN A MISTY AND FOGGY OLD CEMETARY.

A DYING MAN WHOSE INJURIES FROM A WITCH INSTIGATED CAR WRECK DOOM HIM, STILL HAS ENOUGH LIFE IN HIM TO PULL A FIVE FOOT WOODEN CROSS OUT OF THE CEMETARY GROUND AND THEN STAGGER AFTER THE EVIL WITCH COVEN AS HE BLEEDS TO DEATH AND HIS LIFE SLIPS AWAY FROM HIM.

EVEN AFTER THE LEADER OF THE WITCH COVEN THROWS A FOOT LONG DAGGER INTO HIS BACK, THE GUY CRAWLS BACK UP TO HIS FEET BY CLUTCHING AT THE CROSS THAT HE THEN USES AS A FLAME THROWER AGAINST THE COVEN IN THE LAST MINUTE OF HIS LIFE.

FLAMES VIRTUALLY SHOOT OUT OF THE TOP OF THE CROSS AS THE DYING MAN SHOUTS AT ONE WARLOCK, 'WITH THIS CROSS, I DAMN YOU BY THE LIVING GOD!' CAN THE WITCHES GET TO THIS GUY BEFORE HE BURNS THEM ALL WAY TO HELL? BUY THE DVD AND FIND OUT.

I GIVE HORROR HOTEL, EH, I MEAN, CITY OF THE DEAD, A FOUR SKULL RATING! AN ALL TIME HALLOWEEN FAVORITE YOU CAN WATCH ANY TIME OF THE YEAR!!!
