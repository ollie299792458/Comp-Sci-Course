I saw the original Fright Night in the theater back in 1985 as a teenager and loved it. It still holds up as one of the best vampire movies of all time. This new version is an awful, anemic bastardization of the near-perfect original. It's soulless Hollywood trash with none of the flavor or fun, all the life has been squeezed out leaving just another generic teen horror movie no one will remember. And Instead of nerds being the heroes like in the original, we get beautiful 90210-type people saving the day (of course). Worse, nerds in this movie are treated like worthless losers to be cast aside in order to get ahead in life. Gone are the homages to classic vampire movies and TV horror hosts, replaced by soulless Las Vegas D-bag magicians.

Is the new Fright Night unwatchable? No, it's just not very good, like almost everything coming out of Hollywood these days. Even the special effects suck, being really lame CGI. The FX were a million times scarier and gorier in the 80s version! Lest you think I'm wearing rose-colored glasses, I just watched the original and the remake back to back, so it's not nostalgia talking. There's simply no comparison--well, no favorable one, anyway.
