Anyone who is reading these reviews will have seen the TV production and know it inside out; therefore I will limit my review to the DVD picture quality--or rather, the lack of it.
It's a shame that what used to be a beautiful and memorable TV film has become a battered, faded-out shadow of its former self.  It is painful to see something that holds a special place in your heart be treated so shabbily.  For years the only version that millions had seen on TV had such faded color and low contrast that it practically looked like it was shot in black and white!  If that is what you are used to, the
"restored" version on this DVD (and the one shown on TV the last 3 or 4 years) does look marginally better, but it is hardly restored.  One only has to look at a deleted song in the extras section to see how beautiful and glowing the original production was:  sharp, clear, pristine, with highly saturated colors.  The time and money SHOULD have been spent to bring the rest of the film up to this standard.  It is morally wrong to put a defective product on the marketplace, then have the nerve to charge money for it.  As many of our parents probably told us when we were youngsters, "Anything worth doing is worth doing right!"
