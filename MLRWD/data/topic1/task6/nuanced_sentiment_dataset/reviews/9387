To his credit Wolfgang Petersen should be applauded for depicting the Coast Guard and Air Force PJ's as the courageous professionals they truly are (it's the only good thing about the move) but I cannot understand why he felt the need to reduce the crew of the Andrea Gail into a bunch of whooping idiot hicks!  The original story in the book has enough suspense without Petersen having to throw in a fake villain in the form of Michael Ironsides' character and other ridiculous cliche plot devices which actually make this movie worse.  Gee, every movie needs a villain , so I'll just throw one in there! While we're at it, why doen't we have a lovesick loser try to score before his final voyage!! Looks like the $$ signs made Petersen blind to the absurdity of the script.
Petersen has dishonored the memory of the crew of the Andrea Gail and  thrown the dignity of Gloucester into the Hollywood meatgrinder to be chewed up and spit out in the name of profits.  Hey Wolfgang, it IS possible to have a hit movie that doesn't insult people's intelligence. Thanks for nothing.
