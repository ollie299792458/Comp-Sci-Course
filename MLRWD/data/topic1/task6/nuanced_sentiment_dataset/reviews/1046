This is the first movie that I would give 5 out of 5 stars. What makes this so terrible is the fact that it is a documentary.

This is easily the saddest, most frustrating, and overwhelming story I've ever heard. After Andrew Bagby, a medical resident, is found murdered after breaking up with his girlfriend, and his girlfriend is found to be pregnant with his son, a longtime friend, Kurt Kuenne, sets out to make a movie for baby Zachary. The intention of the movie was to film interviews with all of Andrew's close friends and family so his son could have an idea of what great things people thought about his father.

The worst, or should I say, saddest, part about this film is that it is not a mystery. There is such a conclusive and shocking end to this story that you'll wish it wasn't so.

I don't want to give anything away. However, being that it is true; you could also just look it up and find out what happened. Still, I would recommend the movie over a simple news story. The emotional intensity displayed by Andrew Bagby's parents is something that I will never be able to forget.

It's been weeks since I watched this film and I think about it everyday.  I am not a parent, I am not even married but, there are so many aspects to this documentary both good and haunting that will last through my entire life.
