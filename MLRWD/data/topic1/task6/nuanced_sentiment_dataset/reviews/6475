Beneath the Planet of the Apes has Nova and new astronaut Brent searching for Taylor, who is lost in the Forbidden Zone. They are only a few steps ahead of the gorilla army, who are assembling to eradicate what's left of humanity. Nova and Brent go underground into an old subway system, where they find a race of telepathic mutants worshipping an atomic bomb as a God. 
After being captured by the mutants, Nova and Brent find Taylor himself is a captive. After almost killing each other because of the mutants' powers on their minds, they set out to stop the bomb from going up. 
During the gorilla army assault on the mutants' lair, Brent and Nova are killed, and Taylor is seriously injured. The death of his only human companions make Taylor set off the bomb himself, destroying Earth for good. 
None of the Planet of the Apes movies are known for happy endings, but this one is the darkest of them all. Taylor is back only as a cameo, and even that can't save this movie from a bad ending. What's the point of having a conflict between apes and man if the only resolution is everyone getting killed?
The overall concept for this movie wasn't bad: Finding a new civilization separate from the Ape culture, seeing more ruins from Humanity, etc. But the execution was dark and only got darker. If you want to watch a nice, relaxing movie, look elsewhere.
