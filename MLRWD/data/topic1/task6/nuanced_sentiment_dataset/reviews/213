I don't get it... This movie has been praised for years, and I can't stand it! I think Liza Minelli is awful. She can't sing, she can't act, and she's not even that marvelous of a dancer - what did she win an Academy Award for, exactly? Effort? There's plenty of that - it's like she's trying as hard as she possibly can to sing like Judy Garland, act like Barbara Streisand, and just coming off as annoying. Joel Grey is good, I'll warrant, but extremely creepy (I still have nightmares about him, I swear) and Michael York is... well, Michael York. Does he ever actually act in films? I've yet to see it. The musical numbers have been butchered, the plotline destroyed, and the message completely lost. I'm appalled that Kander and Ebb approved of this ghastly reimagining of their wonderful score... It all just makes me sad. If you want to hear a fabulous version of "Cabaret", check out the 1998 version. It's much richer and full of ACTUALLY talented people. Sorry everyone who is a fan, but frankly this movie sucked.
