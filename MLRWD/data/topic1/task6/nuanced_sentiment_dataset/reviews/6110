25 years after the publication of the most important work of a popular superhero ever, and all the buildup to its long-awaited adaptation, its just . . . a letdown.

From the laughable Leno-esque chins to the lack of crucial voice-overs (which had worked SO WELL when you had Bryan Cranston voicing Jim Gordon in Batman:Year One), to the terrible fight animations to the terrible added dialogue . . . everything that could go wrong, did.

Peter Weller was great, and they used some iconic stills from the comic, otherwise it was hard to watch. Whenever it should've been brisk (the news shots), it was too long, and whenever it should've breathed (the first issue scenes), it rushed.

Of course, this all comes back to the decision to forgo any voice-over, which is probably the biggest mistake in this entire production.  Its simply not possible to do the story justice without it.  The first issue (which will always be the most important to me) has almost as much "thought dialogue" as actual spoken dialogue, from the main characters.

Sorry, but if you gut the best part of my favorite comic, I ain't buyin.

This would be a great death . . . instead its a sad imitation.
