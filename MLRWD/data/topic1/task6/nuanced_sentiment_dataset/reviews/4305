This movie is not only BAD it's also one big insult to the entire continent of Africa, not to mention an insult to the intelligence of the audience.
Bruce Willis plays this squad leader for some indescript arm of the US military (is he a Navy Seal, special ops...?? who knows?!).  Bruce is a tough guy who is grappling with his own morality.  He manages to rescue the pretty girl with the big rack, but somehow magically grows a soul after leaving most of the people of her village in a field to be massacred by evil muslim rebels.  (of course, all bad guys are muslim, according to these mindless movies).  At any rate, he grows a soul then decides that he has to help them which involves a mean game of cat and mouse through the jungle with the innocent villagers/bruce/his guys/hot girl with the rack, and the predictably evil muslim rebels who make the occasional stop to rape and pillage along the way.  The movie, of course, comes to an anticlimatic predictable conclusion involving a major gunfight, f-16s and the Cameroonian border.
Frankly, this movie is one big stereotype of conflicts in Africa, not to mention of the tough guy who realizes that he has a soft heart (for the right girl, with the appropriately large rack).  It really just disgusted me with its generalizations and supposedly crazy plot twists.  If you want to see Die Hard On Safari, go see this movie.  Otherwise, if you are interested in something more political and historically accurate and not grossly stereotypical, you may want to see something else.
