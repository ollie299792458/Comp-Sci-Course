Well, after many years in storage, I decided take this special edition set out let my grandchildren experience this movie. My children had watched it and it brought tears to more than one and on more than one occasion. We watched the updated version and were disappointed because the dvd began to stutter, jerk and finally stop. There were no visible scratches, at lest none that serious that could cause this kind of playback problem. Cleaning the disk, using a different player, etc did not solve the problem.

My conclusion is that this could be a media problem. Someone, somewhere could have overlooked quality control and used inferior media because there was some distinct discoloration on outer margins the offending disk and this could be the cause of the problem. I immediately made a copy of the good disk just to be safe. If you have this special edition, check your disks...they may deteriorate faster than you think.

The disk with the original version ran without a problem. And we watched this the next day and the grandkids and one of my grownup daughters thoroughly enjoyed themselves. The movie is timeless but this DVD set may not be.
