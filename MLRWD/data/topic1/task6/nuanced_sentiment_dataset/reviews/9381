This movie has received a lot of flak because of all its violence and the overuse of the F word. Now lets talk about the most hated scene in the whole movie. The chainsaw scene. Sure it is a violent scene but if you watch closely you never once see the chainsaw actually cutting anything in fact you never see anything overtly violent. You see some very bad placed spurts of blood hitting Al Pacino. You can almost see the guy off camera with the bottle of fake blood. You hear the chainsaw, you hear the screams but not much else. It leaves everything up to your imagination sort of like the classic Hitchcock movie, "Psycho".  Now lets get to the other reason people hate this movie. The F word. It is ridiculous how much they use this word in fact I was kind of annoyed after the 50th time. But after a while you kind of get used to it. Its really not that bad. Just think about it, the music these days is as bad if not worse with all that reference to ho's, bitch's, etc. This is just a couple hundred F words badly placed but seriously its not that bad.  I have to give credit to the superb acting. Its absolutly excellent. Now on to the "gangsta' aspect. For some reason the Rap, Hip Hop, genre has adopted this movie as its proverbial bible. This group of people has somehow ignored the moral of the story (which is drugs do not give you a life it takes life away and it is never good to get involved  in drugs) and somehow thinks that becoming Scarface would be very cool and all the things he does is cool. This is very stupid. in fact I resent all those who beleive that becoming Scarface would be cool.
