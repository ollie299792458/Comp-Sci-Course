There are two types of people who should avoid this movie: Hard science fiction buffs, and die-hard fans of the original games, anyone else should find this an enjoyably silly way to spend an evening.
The implausibility factor of this movie is high, there is sound in space, the fighters fly like aeroplanes, there is a quasar in the Sol system and so on. However weighed against that is an entertainingly different way of looking at space battles - that is - more like Das Boot than Star Trek, the ships are small and cramped and battered, the people are jittery and the whole enterprise looks like it's one asteroid short of oblivion. There are also no fancy lasers or energy weapons, just missiles and pellet throwers.
This is also not the Wing commander of the games, the characters have familiar names, but they are not the ones we've known from before. Freddie Prinz Jr is bearable as Blair, but there was probably an interview room full of actors who could have done the job better. Matthew Lillard is good as maniac, and Tch&eacute;ky Karyo is (as ever) excellent as Paladin, despite not being Scottish. The Kilrathi are laughable but they're only visible for about a minute in total, and given the miniscule budget the rest of the SFX are good to excellent.
However the film has two problems: the editing, and the script. The film was apparently edited to remove a sub-plot and that has left it slightly bloodied, the "Pilgrim" idea is not developed and looks like it was tacked on to give Blair a way out a sticky ending, and the overall pacing is very uneven. With a bit more time and a bigger budget, this would have been a hit, but as it is, it's an enjoyable B-movie with a familar name.
