I was in the mood for a "light" movie after watching mostly depressing dramas the last few weeks, so on a recent trip to the video store I picked up Alfie. I had seen the original version with Michael Caine and liked it very much so my expectations going in were pretty low.

I was into it by the time Alfie (Law) had dressed himself and duped his poor neighbor to clean his house while he was away. I have always believed Jude Law was talented, but his performance made the film. He oozed charisma, charm, and wit. He played a role that essentially is self absorbed, but he makes him likeable, even when you despise what he is doing.

I also enjoyed the tone of the film. This is not a campaign to show the swinging lives of good looking men in the modern age. Rather, it works as a mechanism against bachelorhood, and shows the glimpses of content ness and fulfillment when you meet someone special. The cinematography is something that should be noticed. Observe how the director is using colors to depict the state of Alfie, subtle at times, but very effective.

Finally, I was blown away by Sienna Miller, and what a beautiful girl she is. It's hard to believe that she's British because her American accent is one of the best that I have heard on film in quite some time.
