"A Knight's Tale" is a pleasant way to spend an evening watching a movie. Writer, producer and director Brian Helgeland has taken his vision of medevial times and melded it perfectly with the music of today. The first time I viewed this mixture it was a little jarring, but on second viewing it seemed to go together perfectly.
Heath Ledger takes the starring role of William Thatcher a peasant who is determined to change his future and makes it his own, although I still think he's a little over the top, but he has some blockbusters lined up in his future.
My biggest surprise after watching it for the second time recently was a couple of faces in this largely unknown (to me) cast who have become very familiar to me in the last couple of years. They are Heath Ledger's squires Alan Tudyk (from Joss Whedon's great "Firefly") and Mark Addy (from "The Full Monty" and CBS's "Still Standing"). 
The special features are numerous, the transfer is excellent and the 5.1 Dolby is superbly mixed.
