ive read somewhere that the main character from the movie Kids was casted in this movie, he's not...in fact there are very few characters.  it is an independant movie, so it's not high budget or big names, but it's not low budget either.  it really does most of its filming in cambodia, the footage of nyc and bangkok are very brief.  it "falls short" in some aspects and "shines" in moments.  it's not a who, what, when, where, why that peices together at the end, i wouldn't call it a love story, but maybe it is intended to be?  it doesn't waiste time(on)going from one place to the next. because he hasnt written anything else i don't have anything to compare it with.  as an actor,it's not his best role but isn't his worst.  i think he should direct more, some of the script comes alive in an imaginitive way.  i went into this knowing basically nothing, so i don't want to give much away.  but being that it's said he goes from nyc to bangkok, sort of fleeing...there's not a lot of action, violence, sex, or much else.  it's laid back, low-keyed, simple, obscure, and almost wholesome.  i kind of liked that. but it's contradictary at times and your sort of left guessing.  being he's acted for gus van sant, i think he's picked up some of his attributes.  i recommend "kids" "my own private idaho" "physco" and "drugstore cowboy" if you decide you like this movie.
