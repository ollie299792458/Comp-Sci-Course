Although I am a Jazz-Rock fusion fan, and have been since discovering jazz in college, I was pleasantly surprised by the series up to now. Even though I've only seen the series up to Episode 5(I don't own the DVD set)the rich history and background of Ken Burns Jazz has made me aware of the importance of and significance of Jazz to American History and Americans, period. Jazz before the BE-bop era has been a unknown entity to me, you know, some stuff my parents listened to. But since viewing the Jazz series, heck, I think I'll go out and buy some Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman CDS!And this is coming from a hardcore fusion fan(MAHAVISHNU, WEATHER REPORT, RETURN TO FOREVER, TRIBAL TECH, PAT METHENY). Why am I only giving this series four stars? Well,Ken and Wynton only gave a small mention of the modern era(I read about the subjects covered in other articles)and they left a lot of important people(Stan Kenton, Eric Dolphy etc.)out of the series. But, what the heck, maybe somebody else can fill in the gaps. It would have been nice to see 1 or 2 Episodes devoted to jazz-Rock. But, anyway, thanks, Ken and Wynton(even though I disagree strongly with Wynton's opinions about jazz-rock).
